0,"It was the WORST experience I had ever.  My friends and I had dinner at Haidilao,  it was Thursday, just couple days ago. We did reservations on yelp,so fast, they sat us,and the table just right next to the restroom. Yes, even you did make the reservation, and there still a lot of empty tables,not the rush hours, it was 4:00PM. After we ordered the soup base, my friend asking if we can  have another table instead, the waiter just like ""ok,fine"".   When we eating, the waiter never comes back to see us, we were asking for change plates least 3 times,and we ordered the water in the beginning, he just totally forgot about it. We asked him again, he just like ""it's ok, not the big deal "".   Later after he brings the bill to us, even my friends still eating. And the next second( yes, seriously just one second) he asking us if we pay card or cash, we don't even have time to look at the bill, we not finish our food, still bunch of food on the table, he just bring the machine needs us to pay right away. He told us the average tips is between 18%-20% at here, better to tip 20%. We tip 18%. I worked at the restaurant before, I do know that's the normal percentage for tips. but the way how he asked us, push us and the  ATTITUDE WAS SO  RUDE  AND DISGUSTING . And the service was so TERRIBLE.   We spent about $200, it's  three of us. The food was ok. I mean for this price you can find many good hot pot places, not really worth.    Since I have the yelp account almost 6 years, I never written any of bad reviews, even I don't really like the foods or other reasons. But the service I have to say IT WAS THE WORST I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE.   DO NOT RECOMMEND this place.","Great full service hot pot. Expensive compared to other aspects but the service kills it compare to every other hot pot. Lots of freebies, but is included in the price.If you have kids, they have table side cribs. Noodles are done table side in a dance. I would bring big spenders next time during the day.It is not all you can eat so plan accordingly. I will also stay with the cheaper meat because expensive meat doesn't shine too much in hot pot.",I went to haidilao hotpot with my friends tonight！！！I was upset with unprofessional customer service！everywhere was mess and employees not that friendly as people said！！！pls dont come here if you want better service！！！,"I had my first Haidilao experience 18 years ago, to me this remains best hotpot place in the world since then. Even with more and more hotpot brands popping up in China nowadays, I still think Haidilao is THE BEST among them all - the food, the service, the amenities, etc. I was so excited to learn that Haidilao is coming to NYC eventually. My BF made the reservation a month ago and we finally gets to try it today. It is really good, from every aspect.We ordered the soup base with four different flavors, tomato and spicy oil soup base are my all time favorite. The hotpot tastes pretty much like what I had back in China, maybe the tomato soup base is slightly more diluted than what I had in China, but I'm glad they did not ""tailor the flavor"" to accompany the US market, which is what happened to their first LA restaurant - yes I went to their first LA restaurant too when it opened and was very disappointed at what they did to make Haidilao ""Americanized"".Let's talk about dishes. I think the menu in NYC is smaller than the one in China, there are several signature dishes I always get before that are not offered here. Anyway, crispy pork, wagyu beef, and their house special tofu are my favorites. The crispy pork was not oily at all and boiled well in the soup. Wagyu beef - I know it's a pretty hefty price tag - but get it if you can!!! It's beautifully marbled, so soft and tender with just 20 seconds in a boiling soup base. The house special tofu was especially good with their special tofu sauce. The mushroom flavored tofu sauce was very earthy and flavorful, and compliments the simplicity of the tofu, even my bf who doesn't really care about tofu thinks it is very tasty. Everything else is fresh and well prepared. A lot of people get to know Haidilao because of their unbelievably attentive service, the NYC restaurant kept it very well. We were seated fairly fast when we get here, and our waitress Lily did a great job on getting everything we needed for us even though she was busy with several other tables. The restaurant was crazily full and busy for a Sunday dinner, the waiting area was packed from the time we walked in (6:30 pm) till we leave (8:00 pm). There are so many interesting things to try during the wait - the manicure, the massage chairs, free snacks and drinks... They are really trying to make the wait not so boring lol.I always think restroom is a good indicator to see if a restaurant is detail oriented and puts in real thoughts to make their customer experience better. Haidilao nailed it. Ladies, you will find whatever you can think of in Haidilao's restroom - even a Dyson hairdryer and Dior perfume!!! This is literally the nicest and the most thoughtful restroom I've ever seen in NYC. I walked out of this place with a happy belly. The ice cream offered at the end of meal was really good! And we took the food we didn't finish and the leftover tomato soup base home, which is pretty interesting because I don't know any other hotpot places that allow you to take home your soup base... Our meal ends up being around $150 for three people, which I think is pretty standard for a nice a la carte hotpot place. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who wants to get authentic hotpot experience.","The best hotpot I have ever been to. Hands down. The staff couldn't be more accommodating and helpful. Catherine, who appears to be the floor manager here was very kind and informative on what was on the menu. Ben, our server also provided exemplary service. Plates were snatched up as soon as they were empty. The service was truly stellar. I'm not royalty, but I felt like it dining here.","I totally understand why people love this place! The service and amenities are excellent! My friend and I went on a Thursdays evening at around 6pm and the wait was not that bad and we didn't have a reservation, but that might be because it was raining. We waited only about 15-20 minutes. The waiting room was packed as we were leaving though. The entrance is in the back, through the Flushing Commons square. Once you arrive, there are staff that put you on the waiting list and give you a number. There are some drinks and fruit by the entrance as well as seats for waiting. The main waiting room is upstairs where there are more seats, snacks, drinks, games, a kids play area, two massage chairs, and the hand message and glasses/jewelry cleaning service. There are also charging banks and screen protector changing, although I didn't see where that was being done. All of this is free! You do have to sign up for the hand massage though on the ipad by the massaging station. They'll give you a print out of your number and call you when it is your turn. The person manning that station at the time only spoke Mandarin though. When your table is ready, your number will be called over the loud speakers and you are taken to your table.The table seating is very modern and booth-like. There are drawers under the seats where extra bowls and utensils are stored. Food is ordered through a tablet. Our server was Andrew and he was great. He explained the menu to us, brough over some condiments for our soup, and even diluted our beef mala broth with tomato broth when we found it too spicy for us! Food arrived quickly. We ordered the four different broths, seafood, filtered beef mala (without peppercorns), mushroom, and tomato. The beef mala broth was very spicy even when we asked for less spicy! Be careful with the heat! The mushroom was very mild and kind of bland. Our favorites were the seafood and surprisingly the tomato. There are two sauce stations with a variety of sauces and well as recipes to make a dipping sauce if you have no idea what to mix together. In addition to the sauces, there are free fruits, some cold appetizers (spicy cucumber, vermicelli, tripe), and some desserts (grass jelly, sweet congee). I believe it varies. We ordered way too much food and was too full to try the desserts offered at the sauce stations. I recommend checking out the sauce station to see what they have before ordering. Ordering combos is the way to go. I would avoid ordering the baby octopus since it gets tough if you leave it in the broths too long. I also didn't like the wheat noodles. They start to clump if cooked too long and was very heavy tasting. At certain times, there is a mask changing show. The dancing noodle also comes with a mini performance as the noodles are being stretched and thrown. Unfortunately, we were too stuffed to try these noodles, but we saw the performance from the nearby tables that ordered them. It was cute and a bit cheesy. At the end of the meal, our server Andrew got us ice cream cones which were delicious and very creamy. Much better than I expected!Make sure you check out the restroom before you leave! It is fully stocked in there with baby wipes, combs, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and even a facial spray and perfume! The toilet seats were even heated which was so nice! If you missed out on the amenities in the waiting room, you can try them out after your meal. Excellent service, but I had yummier hot pot elsewhere. Since it is an a la cart hot pot dining experience, it can get expensive quickly. Don't order too much at once so you can enjoy the sauce station!",Haidilao Hotpot
1,Randomly came across this place on yelp and couldn't believe all the reviews they had and all 5 stars?? (What what??) I decided to give it a try for brunch on a Saturday and boy were these reviews on point! The burger? BOMB! The truffle fries? BOMB!! The drinks?! BOMB!!,My go-to brunch spot in Queens! Service is always friendly here. I usually get the avocado toast because I'm boring but it never disappoints!I also love their margaritas/monitors. Really interesting flavors!,Ratings for this place has got to be rigged. Overall Rating: 2.75 Stars for average food and inexperienced staff.  Slightly odd and pretty underwhelming experience. Food: 3 StarsThere was nothing special about it.Service: 2.5 StarsGetting a table for 3 was a long wait because most of their tables are for couples and their largest table was held for a party of 5 or more.  Worst part is there's nowhere to wait besides in the heat outside or by the bar which is really reserved for drinking only.  We basically had nowhere to wait and saw a couple of empty tables around that they wouldn't seat us at.Atmosphere: 2.5 StarsIt was very cluttered and instead of using their  ACs on a hot summer day they had fans on resulting in unnecessary mugginess.  The servers would wiggle their way in between customers and often bumped into me instead of walking where there was more space.,"Lovely neighborhood restaurant with a late night kitchen. We will often show up close to midnight looking for dinner. The service has never faltered and the food has never disappointed in the past 3 years. We come in about 3 times a month. The staff are amazingly nice. We are often greeted with a ""hey guys!"" and a hand shake. The service is attentive and quick. The menu is simple, with lots of items to choose from: sandwiches, salads, burgers (yum!!), and nachos (my fav) just to name a few. I would describe the menu as wholesome, comfort food. The dishes are simple, without overly complex flavors and no fancy-shmancy sauces. BUT that does not mean the food isn't fantastic. It is very good, quality food with flavors that stand out. Also, they have a great tap list from local breweries and quality glasses of wine for under $10. We will continue to come here for our late night dinners.","September 2019 11/10! Thank you Jonathan and Geill? (sorry I misspelled your name) for this amazing meal! from ambiance to food, perfection! A restaurant with such good vibes are hard to come around and when it does, I have to keep telling people about it! The servers and customers there were so friendly in suggesting what's good in this tiny but cozy place in the hearty of Sunnyside, happy hours til 7pm. We had all the popular dishes like nachos, skirt steak lollipop, alcove burger with upgraded truffle fries, cuban sandwich, angus burger (when I actually meant to order alcove, either way, this is delicious as well), and the churros with mango sorbet. We also tried the margarita flight (included in HH!) with guava, passiofruit, pineapple and traditional flavors (shot glass sized), tamarind margarita, and blueberry beer! We all enjoyed our time there and I definitely would come back for more! Keep it up, The Alcove!","Our experience on Friday night was extraordinary! The 30 minute wait was more than worth it. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant, and looked around to see that the place was packed to the brim! All the other tables were taken along with all the seats at the bar. Usually in establishments where the owner is helping out it turns out to be a top notch place. Our waiter and our bartender were the owner's brothers, and we could clearly feel the passion behind their amazing service.To eat, we started with the patacones. As an avid meat eater, I loved that they added topped them with pork. To eat, I ordered the Chimichurri Truffle Fries. It sounds like a weird combination but it was actually very delicious. We also got the steak lollipops which were very well seasoned and tender.The grilled chicken tacos were a hit too. They have an amazing local beer selection, and offer margarita flights. After a long day of work there's nothing I wanted more than a margarita flight. The servings are small but definitely potent. I was also surprised to learn that it was my birthday that night. When I returned from the bathroom, the wait staff and the owner brought out warm churros and ice cream. They also belted out ""Happy Birthday"" in the best harmony I've ever heard. They were delicious and a great ending to our meal. The food was great and the hospitality was unforgettable. I can't wait to return!",The Alcove
2,"I ate here once for lunch and once for dinner. Atmosphere, food, and service is just ok. Nothing to rave about, just an average restaurant",Came to Jack and Nellie's for brunch one day. I think we got there around 1pm. We were able to get a seat immediately. Water was given to us as soon as we sat. I ordered the egg white omelet which had spinach and goat cheese. It also came with season fruits and some wheat toast. The goat cheese was kinda hard to find in the omelet. My friend ordered the French toast with a side of candied Canadian bacon. They weren't too pleased with the bacon.,Had the burger for brunch.  Asked for a medium rare burger....got a hockey puck. Couldn't finish it.  So dry.  Fries were horrible as well.  McDonald's fries are better!  Drinks and service was great.  Food sucked.  How do you mess up a burger? For shame.,I've passed by this place many times and I was finally able to come here for brunch! Came here with my BFF who drove all the way from Philly to spend the day with me! I was surprised that there was no line on a Saturday but thank God cause we were starving!!The ambiance is very rustic/casual and the menu is small which I like: quality over quantity. I ordered the french toast with a side of bacon and she ordered the steak & eggs if I remember correctly. I also ordered a bloody mary which was THE BOMB!The french toast was nice and light with the combination of fruits was delicious but I was thankful I ordered the bacon cause it really hit the spot. BFF said her order was also very good. I came back again for dinner on a different day and it was...okayy. I would prefer coming back here for brunch again and definitely ordering the bloody mary again!,"The food was great but the service could've been better. We felt rushed from beginning w to the end when we received the check. This one waitress kept giving us weird looks and when I asked for stuff it was like I was asking her for a refill of water, it was like I asked her to give me water from the moon. I really wanted to say can I speak to your manager to ask him/her to fix your attitude?? I don't know if I'll be returning. If I do go again and see the same waitress, I would definitely say something about her attitude.","Came in for brunch with the missus and a friend. In an area where brunch places are a dime a dozen, finding a place that does it better than the others becomes a bit of a task. My go to tends to be eggs benedict, but whatever it is you end up ordering leaves you with a sense of satisfaction in the belly. Luckily for me the missus picked that so I can go to town on the burger. If you show up, show up early because the place fills out quick and the wait time can be harsh.",Jack & Nellie's
3,I had a margarita on the rocks and a frozen margarita wasn't the best I've had. The ambiance was good.,"I came here last week and had a very nice and delicious brunch with my husband and baby. Just now at 11:14am I figure I would return for some mangu and a cold beer since my daughter finally fell asleep. The moment I walked in a gentleman that worked there mumbled something unpleasant, rolled his eyes and pointed to a table in annoyance. Guess I was too early. I felt extremely uncomfortable and unwelcome. I told him never mind and he kept it moving without a care. Me and my Husband live in the Austin area and look forward to brunch every weekend. All it takes is one negative experience to never return somewhere, and at that I was with my child. Back to Jack & Nellies where I can show up a minute early and still receive a warm welcome!","Great food, great atmosphere, responsive staff that are accommodating. But drinks are lackluster, I been to most of the restaurants around Mojos and they are the worst in terms of quality of drinks, food they are one of the best, but if you can't get me a decent margarita I won't be back, I can deal with bad food with good drinks but I can't deal with good food with bad drinks.","Finally made it to Mojo after attending an Elite event here. Let me just say that the service here is OUTSTANDING! Kamila at the bar is the sweetest and friendliest bartender I've encountered. Not to mention her drinks are BOMB! We arrived here on a Sunday night for a few drinks before  the long work week. We decided to get mojitos which were an excellent choice. Both the passion fruit and the coconut were so good. I highly recommend the coconut! Appetizers: we got the guacamole, a little spicy but I love spice. We got a side of sweet plantains which were perfect to settle the spice. We also got the skirt steak skewers with yuca frita, the yuca was delicious. This is a great place to grab some drinks at anytime if you're looking for a delicious cocktail. The staff is super friendly and the service is outstanding!","Mojo has been on my to-go list from the moment I found out that it was taking over the former Exo Cafe spot. I tried to keep this place a secret until it was my hunny's birthday. Earlier in the day I dropped off a cake from Martha's Country Bakery at Mojo so that I could surprise my hunny with it after we finished dining. I have to say that the Mojo staff were not only accommodating, but also understanding of me wanting his night to be perfect. I initially had a reservation at 7pm for two, but his mom and brother wanted to take him out also so I changed the reservation to 7:30pm for a party of four. We were seated upstairs where our waitress gave us ample amount of time to make our decision.We started off with apps and drinks which consisted of Moscato, Watermelon Frozé, and a La Amazonica. My hunny's La Amazonica was too strong for me. The Watermelon Frozé was bomb.com. I love frozen drinks. It tasted like a watermelon jolly rancher slushy. I definitely recommend trying it as it is one of their strongest frozen drinks. For our apps we ordered Tostones and Frituras Del Mar. I'm not sure how the tostones turned out but they were finished before I was able to take a picture. Our Frituras Del Mar app was on the smaller side and looked like a dish for one person, maybe a dish for two if you don't have much of an appetite. Certainly not a dish that can be easily served amongst four people. The Frituras Del Mar was okay but can be vastly improved if the dish was cooked a little longer. The batter was lightly fried which didn't provide the crunchiness I was longing for. I'm a huge fan of pickled onions but it didn't add much flavor to the dish, however it was aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The green sauce was amazing. I didn't care for the tartar sauce. Our entrees consisted of the Jumpin' Lomo, Churrasco, and Latino Fried Rice. My hunny and I both enjoyed our Churassco. We ordered our skirt steak medium which came out perfectly cooked. The garlic rice was really good. My only gripe is that the beans did not come out with our dish. I mentioned the missing beans to our waitress. She brought our beans out momentarily. His brother enjoyed his Jumpin' Lomo, but stated that the dish became salty towards the end of his meal. He also said that the portions could've been bigger -- I totally agree. His mom stated that the dish tasted rank and that the meat didn't taste as if it was cleaned properly. I'm not sure what their meals tasted like but the guys finished their meals. His mom and I ended up taking the rest of our meals home. Our waitress was kind enough to provide a sparkler for my hunny's birthday cake and even went as far as singing Happy Birthday to him with a few of her coworkers.I give Mojo a solid 3.5 stars.","Food and drinks are great here. The only reason I docked a star is because whenever I've gone I've gotten the skirt steak. Both times I've asked for medium and both times I've received it very well done. It was still yummy, but a little chewier than I wanted. Other than that, no complaints. The ambiance is nice, and in the summer the doors are open so you feel like you're dining outside. They used to have a spicy margarita or some frozen spicy drink which was awesome but they got rid of it because many people did not like it. If you like spicy margaritas like I do, the bartender will mix in jalapeño oil to spice it up.",Mojo Restaurant
4,"My kind of brunch spot!I tried a few dishes from Queens Comfort:Atomic Fire BallsAn eggs benedict dish (can't remember the name)Nutella and banana stuffed french toastCarafe of OJEverything was delish! Definitely unique brunch items.The only thing I didn't like was that we arrived before opening and there was a line (which is fine). But they opened 10 minutes late. That's not cool especially when a line is expected AND it was raining. There was a bouncer (yup) keeping us entertained, at least.",FOOD: 8.5/10SERVICE: 8/10AMBIANCE:9/10RECCOMENDATION: captain crunch crusted chicken sandwichMAJOR KEY ALERT!!! This place is poppin; the music they play is fire and the decor all around the place is retro af. They got old school toys and throwback posters all around the wall. They were also playing star wars on a projector which was cool too I guess. The food was also wild af. They had guacamole stuffed onion rings which I thought was too heavy for me and a bomb captain crunch crusted chicken sandwich. I will definitely be coming back to try the other crazy items on the menu. Definitely rated GAF.,"Popular spot in Astoria for weekend brunch. Staff is really friendly and a man that appeared to be the owner or manager checked in with all the tables. Cool decor with the walls covered with children's toys. Brunch was very reasonably priced, but I didn't really like the non-standard hollandaise sauce on my eggs Benedict.","Came for brunch and had the chicken and wafflesThey use corn flakes to make the chicken nice and crispy.My boyfriend had the brunch burger that has a fried egg and hash brown inside. If you want a fully loaded burger then get that it's really good. They haven't started serving liquor yet so we brought a bottle of champagne and they provided the orange juice  Service was great and everyone was friendly and really inviting. The dj plays a really good mix of music (r&b, pop, reggaeton) - fun vibe with funky decor really cute","Came here for brunch on Sunday with my daughter.  The food was very good, I had warm bread with bacon, Brie cheese, poached egg & hollandaise sauce! Sooo Good!!!  My mouth was like ""Wow"" The plate was small but so filling, I was stuffed when I finished my plate. My daughter had pumpkin cheesecake stuffed French toast , I tasted it and Wow! Sweet & Delish! Cash only, but prices are reasonable","Always an amazing experience and even better food! Happy to hear they recently got their liquor license. I can only imagine what crazy drinks they will create for the menu. I also admire Queens Comfort for hosting charity events such as food drives or toy drives around the holidays. If you bring an item, you get to eat their mac n cheese and drink the keg for free! Awesome way to being in members of the community for something charitable!",Queens Comfort
5,"Unsanitary and unsafe food practice. The food is not bad. Get the pan fried pork buns and steamed soup dumplings. PASS ON THE SCALLION PANCAKE WITH BEEF!!!!! Thank god I saw this after I finished my soup dumplings. Because they had onions, potatoes, and ginger under a dirty table next to the broom pan !! GROSS !!! The entrance is also very hidden and easily passed by. Also a lot of rukus inside the kitchen.","This review is only for their take out. I had ordered on seamless, and took a quick walk to pick up. The food was already ready when I got there so it was quick and easy. The soup dumplings were good, but not great. The Seafood over crispy noodles were actually very disappointing. Since it's such a saucy dish, it would have been better to separate it from the noodle. The noodles were so soggy, and the flavor was so bland. I took about two bites and didn't even want to eat any further. I hesitate to go back, but maybe the sit in experience would be better with other items.","The hype is legitimate, and this purveyor of Shanghai style snacks has officially joined my list of best dumplings in the city, as well as my favorite establishment in Forest Hills (although sadly the latter statement isn't really saying that much IMO).  While the house specialties, the soup dumplings, both the crab and pork and straight up pork varieties, are very tasty indeed, my favorites here are actually the other dumplings on offer, particularly the Pan Fried Beef Dumplings.  They are just as succulent and nearly as juicy as those soup dumplings. so be prepared when biting in or you just may end up with a stained shirt!   Almost as delicious are the pan fried pork, with the quite tasty steamed chicken curry and shrimp dumplings coming in right behind them on my list.  Just don't go in here expecting Chinatown-cheap prices or you'll be jolted with some serious sticker shock.  Despite being located this far out east in Queens the prices are fairly in line with, or even upwards of what I have come to expect in the gentrified, updated ""artisanal"" dumpling shops in the chic-er parts of BK and Manhattan, like (my beloved) East Wind Snack Shop in BK or Mimi Cheng's in Manhattan, around 8 bucks an order of dumplings.  But, hey this is no doubt at least in large part due to the use of more premium ingredients, and again the dumplings are damn delicious so stop whining that they aren't a buck an order or just go eat some lesser dumplings.....","I'm not sure what experiences folks with less than stellar reviews had at this place, but my boyfriend and I went and the food was spectacular. We ordered the scallion pancake with beef, the soup dumplings, the shrimp dumplings, and the beef noodle soup with bok choy and asked for it spicy, and for $30 total for two people we left stuffed! I loved the beef scallion pancake and the soup dumplings the best, and my boyfriend loved his spicy beef and noodle soup. When they say ""spicy"" they are serious, it was a good amount of heat with plenty of kick. The soup dumplings are adorable, not too big, not too tiny, and the thickness is just right where they don't burst when you try to pick them up, but you can easily bit into them and slurp out the soup without it spilling all over everywhere.As people have mentioned this place is TINY, but it is fresh, homemade, and with a limited item menu. If you have a spare afternoon, I highly recommended taking the train or a drive out to Forest Hills, park near Austin Street, get some dim sum at memories of shanghai, and then walk around the neighborhood.","Ventured to Queens and came here before a Death Can for Cutie concert at Forest Hills Stadium (about a 5-10 minute walk). Great ""hole in the wall"" dim sum place, it's literally located in an alley way and feels super authentic with a modern twist. It's super small place with only 2 tables inside but they do have some tables outside to eat at as well, which is probably better for nicer weather. Probably best with small groups or for take-out/delivery.We ordered the veggie pot stickers, xia long bao, shao mai, and chili wontons. Each dish came out to between $6-$8 each. We also had taro and pumpkin pancakes for dessert. Not sure if it's because we waited too long to eat the dessert (it came out first) but they were a little too dry for my taste. Would be down to try some other sweets they have.","Great soup dumplings and great hot soy milk. Great service on weekday. On weekend encountered arrogant clueless counter person who took order of later arriving person and paid no attention to us. We left without ordering. I've decided to forgive that one strange weekend slight5 stars is more reflective of the excellence ofI upgraded too quickly After doing so I ordered pan fried noodles with shrimp and vegetables. What I got: clump of fried noodles sitting in bowl of gravy, few tiny shrimp and few little pieces of vegetable... for $11.95Ridiculous",Memories of Shanghai
6,"Food great!Service needs major improvement!  Waitress disrespectful and was just annoying all night long.  No customer service at all.  This was my local go to spot for drinks and food, but after the horrendous experience i had, i will never go back and will not recommend at all especially if that same waitress and hostess are there.  Overall experience -  Unsatisfied!",Not really satisfied w the food. My best friend & I both got chicken the chicken sandwich. The coleslaw wasn't good & messed up the sandwich. I had to take mine off to save it. I probably would suggest it unless u went bar hopping already. Our server was nice but I wouldn't come back. Food & drinks weren't good enough,"This place is a joke. We called prior to taking an Uber over to ensure they were still serving food and the rude, possibly drunk, woman that answer indicated that indeed they were serving a limited menu until 1 am before abruptly slamming the phone down. We took an Uber over and upon entering we sat down and asked for a late night menu. The bartender then told us they stopped serving at midnight. When I told him we called and even showed him my phone and time he claimed the idiot who answered the phone didn't know what day it was. There were others at the bar complaining. Don't waste your time.","We LOVE Station House!!!! Great music, drinks and atmosphere!Mac and cheese is to kill for! This is a great spot to come for an app, drinand a date!","Sooooo, the three stars do not reflect service, the drinks or the space. All were great.The food, however was, meh. The empanadas and truffle fries were actually pretty good. The wings were OK. The cheesesteak flatbread madness was a disappointment. A cheesesteak needs something to hold all of its goodness. Unfortunately, flatbread just can't handle the task. It was a soppy mess. The flavor profile had a bit too much tang for me. Think this needs more thought from the presentation to the preparation.Other than that, I would return for sure. It's has a warm, woody charm that you expect from a gastropub (love that word, lol).","It's Sunday afternoon in Forest Hills and debating where to go for brunch. We even walked pass by the Forest Hills Station House. Thank goodness for Yelp reviews that we found this place. Ambiance- Give it 4 starsWalked in and there were many diners here for Sunday Brunch. Our table was under a screen. At first thought it was a sports game but looked up and it was a listing of all their beers available.  Service- Give it 4 starsWaitress was quick and walked pretty fast too if you turn your head she is gone. Had to take a minute or two to look at the menu as well as the drinks. Flagged her over when we were done reviewing their menu. There were other staff members who came over to fill your glass of water. Other staff who brought over the entree. Good team effort.Food- Give it 4 starsOrdered the Smoked Brisket Hash which was nicely prepared. There were more hash than the brisket in the entree. The over easy eggs were good, but my favorite was the Texas toast. What did they put in these toast? They are so yummy.The other dish was Chimichurri Steak and Eggs- grilled hanger steak, sunny side up eggs with potato hash and texas toast. Guess what, I ate my friends Texas toast. Steak was medium rare and the Chimichurri sauce gave it a kick.Drinks were well prepared. Ordered two rounds. Would have stayed longer, but my friend had a plane to catch.Will be back again.",Forest Hills Station House
7,After reading the reviews of 79 I had to try it for myself. I must say the food here is delicious and thr service was completely on point.  The only draw back is that parking is very tough around here.,"I've been here twice now - and the second time was because I forgotten I had gone here because the food was unremarkable during lunch my first visit. This time around I tried the som tum, pad Thai, red curry and basil eggplant stir fry. I think that the basil eggplant stir fry was the best dish we had on the table and it was the only one we finished. The rest was just average to subpar tasting Thai food that you can get anywhere else in the city. If it wasn't for the proximity of this restaurant to Elmhurst's mini Thai town I suppose that might be ok but I was disappointed and regretted not going to one of my favorite haunts there instead. My recommendation is skip this place and head to Elmhurst Av and eat over there instead.","According to my check ins I've been here 9 times- might be more! Noticing the food is changing. The Pad Thai is now overly sweet and more chewy. I had a whole fish here as well with a mango salad and I don't recall anything remarkable besides the fish's head. I am sad because this was my favorite Thai place in the area. P.S. They must be cleaning their dishes/utensils with bleach, but the smell for me on the cups is too much.","This place is a gem! It's spacious and the decor is very modern chic.My partner and I came with high expectations, and they were met.The flavors were so bold, but not overbearing. Everything was cooked just right.Everything was simply delicious- nothing was left behind!The service was great. No complaints.The only possible downside is that this location is very close to a train. Every time one passes by, you slightly hear/feel it. Nothing too crazy.Can't wait to come back!","The crispy duck in red curry is out of this world. Really high end. We also had the rice noodles in green curry (with chicken). So satisfying. The presentation of the dishes is careful and attractive. I ordered warm sake to go with the meal and was pleasantly surprised that the combination worked well. Chic ambiance, nice for a date. Very friendly to children too though.There are several thai restaurants in the neighborhood but this one is definitely #1!","Eaten in and ordered delivery via Yelp from Kitchen 79 for years so I've decided to leave a review. Interior is very modern though all of the glassware and close proximity to other tables have prevented us from bringing our young kids here. Service is always top notch here as they wait staff is has always been attentive to our needs. Here are some of our thoughtsPros:- reasonably priced and the food is consistently cooked well. #1 reason why we keep coming back with take out orders- very quick turnaround time from the time of our order to food at our table/at our door- nice mix of modern and traditional dishes- lots of healthier options/alternatives- clean bathroomCons:- don't bother leaving comments on online orders. For example, we've repeatedly requested that our order not include plastic utensils, plastic straws and white rice which is ignored (trying to reduce waste)- there were few times that our food was either over cooked, overly oily, or ended up being smaller than normal. However this is not the norm.- restaurant can be tight",Kitchen 79
8,"Here at Brunch for my sister who's visiting from Miami, Birthday! Have to say that the experience the ambience, the music, the food, the drinks, and the service is impeccably on point and I can't wait to come back for another celebration on any other day!","I love a good Cajun seafood boil, but this place is the absolute worst seafood boil I've ever had. The seafood was way over cooked and not actually a pound of shrimp or a pound of clams. I ordered the spicy version of it and it wasn't spicy in the least. My tongue wasn't tingling at all. The seafood boil honestly was like vomit to me. When I asked the waitress if it was spicy, she said she had it written down as spicy and scurried off. This is probably the worst restaurant I've been to in NYC. I will say the special of the cinnamon fried chicken and waffles were really great, and so was the cornbread but wow the seafood boil was so horrible it ruined the rest of my day. AVOID SEAFOOD BOIL AT ALL COST.","My boyfriend and I got the 2 po boy sandwiches that they offer and both of them were extremely tasty ! The only thing I wasn't too fond on was the Mac n cheese on the sugar freak po boy , I think it could of been better without it. Other than that I think I would check out this place again to try out what other things they have! I should also mention that the service was very good here and pretty quick !","Sugar Freak is a tasty Louisiana Creole restaurant in Astoria. The place is big and they don't take reservations, but I came late enough and missed any crowds on a weekend night.  The service was friendly and efficient.The food was all tasty.  I particularly enjoyed the fried okra and the jambalaya.  My wife loved their baked oysters.  Recommended!","My partner and I came here on a Friday night. It was packed! The decor was beautiful- it had a NOLA vibe.Our server was really great.The food was.... subpar. The drinks were okay.We got the calamari as a starter.She got the shrimp Po Boy, I got the Holy Trinity Po Boy (oysters, catfish and shrimp) and we had to order a side of fries (since you have to pay separately for sides).According to her, her sandwich was good.Mine... not so much. For almost $18, I expected more flavor.The oysters were cooked PERFECTLY. The shrimp was good but the catfish tasted like old oil.The sweet potato fries were good.They charged us 1.50 for a side of spicy mayo. Absurd.I got the ""Hurricane"" cocktail and she got the Sazerac. My drink was kind of weak. Her drink was good.For $105 before tip, I could've had a better meal. I'm not too sure if I'd give this place another try- I probably would.","So if you ever had Louisiana Gumbo and wanted a retake on it GO HERE it's good! We had the seafood gumbo. The fried chicken was too salty and so was the collards. The charbroiled oysters we all loved. The fried calamari was good except they fry hot pickled peppers which added a great kick but after a while you realized you have more peppers  that calamari.. made me fall in love fried peppers, great bite to this dish but hey! I ordered Fried Calamari... where is it...?!? The deviled eggs were also quite good. Mac and cheese tasted like powdered cheese, no one was a fan.Drinks I thought were masked by way too much ice. Like the sangria you taste that if only it didn't have so much ice..well dam this is some good sangria :/The seafood jambalaya was okay not enough rice though.",Sugar Freak
9,"Come here for a drink,  don't even think about duck burger because it was gross. I'd French onion soup it was a lot cheese in it that's why I didn't like it much. Service was good they always checked our table how everything was. Overall, I didn't like the place in terms of food but def go back for a drink","I would not come back and I would not recommend this place to anyone.The service and interior are nice. The food was bad. Upsetting to have to pay so much for such substandard food. Our oysters ($1 each at happy hour) were gritty and weren't cut. The oysters were shucked but weren't detached from the shells so you had to pry them off yourself. The Gouda Duck Burger - I read good reviews but this burger didn't taste like duck and was way over seasoned.  The only reason I could handle the over-seasoning was because they gave it to us with unsalted fries. The fries of course got soggy quickly since they were unsalted... The Braised Short Rib and Cavatelli - salty and the short rib reminded my bf of canned beef... Sadly, this was a disappointing birthday dinner.",Gone are the days of the old sanfords where they actually cared about the food. The experience was lackluster. I ordered a eggs and corned beef hash. It was dry. It was plaim and normal. Flavorless. I could've made better eggs at home. The presentation was lacking. My wife ordered waffles and duck confit. Um. We ordered duck- not overfried bones with skin. And i guess just having two pieces of meat over 2 dry waffles counts as fancy? I don't recommend this place. It sucked.,"Went here for the first time with my sisters for brunch. I had a reservation for 2:30. As usual one of the sister's were late. Instead of making us wait outside like prostitutes,lol they let 3 of us sit (sis 4 arrived at the same time drinks were served).The place was clean. All staff I encounter from hostess to busboys were friendly and accommodating.Oh yeah, food and drinks were good as well. They grilled my turkey bacon and I must say it was the best I had.See you next time.","Sanfords in Astoria has an unassuming storefront tucked between other identical brownstones off of Broadway, but walking inside you will find an elegant dining area and an even more impressive bar. Their whiskey collection is expansive, lined up neatly on lighted shelves by country and is ridiculously pleasing to look at.My friend and I came to catch their happy hour, which they have every day from 4 to 7 PM, offering $1 oysters and more importantly, $7 select whiskeys.We ended up staying at the bar the entire night, enjoying their wide selection of whiskeys and almost everything off of the starters menu. All the food we had was made fresh and flavored generously; I would especially recommend anything truffle, from their fries to the mac and cheese. Our bartender/waiter Rocco was personable and knew his whiskey, and was always happy to recommend his choice of peaty drink or have us try out his next cocktail in making. Before leaving, he gave us a free sip of the No Name blended scotch we were itching to try but never got to - will definitely be coming back again for a full pour.","Ever since they renovated the place years ago ..It's always been busy, especially for weekends brunch ... we were there on a Saturday around 3'ish It was not busy at all ... which is good for us !! Summer time Resaturant businesses are slow down .. the food really good it's actually gotten better all our orders ... service is always good and friendly... I live in the neighborhood so I'm there a lot ... I do recommended for get together with friends or for a date night ( good ambiance )",Sanfords Astoria
10,"Food was a joke.  First off the flavors dont mixed well for the al pastor. The portion was expectantly small for the price.  The bloody mary was straight up pickle juice. Only decor was nice. Very expected from a white neighborhood, complete misconception of tacos","Metro Taco gives off a very 'gentrification is coming' kind of vibe to Metropolitan Avenue: scarface playing at the bar, pricey cocktails, and experimental hardshell tacos. I came for dinner on a Friday and it was popping with a long line of surprisingly well-dressed people. I don't really get the culinary appeal: hardshell tacos were kind of interesting but I didn't find to be that tasty, and the price-point is such that you are actually disappointed if you don't love the food. My two friends and I thought it was pretty 'Meh', but reviews suggest people love it. If you want something trendy for a date or to prove that the neighborhood is cool, it's a decent spot. Within a few blocks, there is Rimtin (great Turkish food) and Deasura (great Syrian food) that I strongly prefer.",Metro Taco is Coyoacan in Queens! This establishment will not be a best kept secret for long. Go now before the wait and reservation list gets out of control.,"I came here on a Sunday night for dinner as I was in the mood for Mexican food. This spot is cute for a casual date or meal with friends. The restaurant has simple decor with strings of lights cascading from the ceiling and a book shelf dividing the bar from the seated dining area. Between my friend and I, we had the sweet potato taquitos, drunken shrimp and fish tacos with a side of rice and beans. The taquitos were really good and crunchy, especially the sauce it was paired with. The shrimp tacos were pretty good, but was lacking a bit in flavor. The fish tacos were tasty and you can't go wrong with rice and beans. The service was really friendly and accommodating too. We ended up staying close to closing, but our servers didn't rush us or anything. This is a sweet spot for Mexican food and I'd dine here again when I'm in the neighborhood.","Lackluster. Nacho tower: messy, inconsistent layers and a bit gimmicky. The flavor wasn't terrible but it was also just too messy to eat. By the time we got to the bottom layers they were sopping wet. Chicken tacos: bland. has potential but lacking an umph. The chicken was also lukewarm which is unfavorable. La cosecha tacos: meh. I was genuinely looking forward to eating these. But they were ultimately not impressive. Very bland, the shell was also not elastic enough to hold the taco and ended up ripping. Also served cold and lacking a little salt. We ended up putting the salsa and sour cream from the nacho tower on it to bring it some flavor.  Mexican chocolate cake: pretty decent. resembled a cinnamon covered soufflé with out a runny center. Clearly microwaved as some parts were ice cold and others burned your tongue. Service was decent as well. However took the waitress about 10 minutes to get to our table and take our drink orders. Overall will probably not return until they get all their ducks in a row.","Cinco De Mayo was probably a good time to visit Metro Tacos.  The Nachos tower is pretty cool and unique.  The layering of chips and topping was a sight to behold.  Definitely enough to feed 4 here.Of the Tacos I sampled, the Drunken Shrimp Tacos included really good sized plump and juicy shrimp.  They are a bit naked even though 'Drunken' but the salsa and hot sauce on the side remedied that quickly.  The Grilled Chicken included pieces of chicken breast and wasn't at all dry.  Finally the Beef Barbacoa was good as well but a little on the salty side.  All the Tacos were nicely dressed with fresh greens.",Metro Taco
11,"Got here round 10:10am on a Tuesday morning. First customers there, and a few tables joined right after. We ordered before the other tables. Our food literally took over 45 minutes. The waitress didn't even give us a chance to try anything, she asked how everything was as soon as the server dropped off the food. Our 5 year old received burned pancakes, took a few bites and didn't want them because they were so dark. My tomato soup was good, but the adult grilled cheese was not. The cheese tasted bad, the tomato was ice cold and the avocado was brown mush. My Wife's shrimp and grits, the tails were left on, the grits were clumpy and runny and she said it was ok, probably because she wanted to be nice. The price for the food here is ridiculous. $15 for blackened pancakes with fruity pebbles, some fruit and whip crea that took more than 45 minutes while our toddler kept crying about why his food was taking so long. My wife didn't even ask for a to go box, but the waitress just dropped it off in front of her while she was eating. We had a feel the waitress was giving us an attitude because our son was crying because the food was taking forever. To get the check was another mission. The food and service at this location was unforgettably bad. We would definitely not return or recommend this locAtion. For the price of the food and what they give, I wouldn't recommend the restaurant.","Got here round 10:10am on a Tuesday morning. First customers there, and a few tables joined right after.

The service was lacking and they weren't crowded at all, some servers were just standing around talking instead of attending to the patrons. I had to constantly get my servers attention, my boyfriend even had to get up one time which I hate when you have to do that to get something for the table. The food was okay not as good as it looks in pictures, it was just okay.... The Mac was decent not anything I'd come back for. It's really a spot to take great pics of dishes that look cool and appetizing.","As a connaisseur of all things Mac and cheese, we tried out Mom's Mac & Cheese balls and pancakes. The balls were fried to perfection. Lovely little golden brown balls of joy, slathered with a perfectly tangy/spicy buffalo sauce. Skip the Mac and Cheese pancakes. While an interesting idea, they tasted like normal pancakes with the occasional surprise of noodles in the batter. It made for an interesting, albeit normal appetizer. Also gotta give Mom's some snaps on the size of their food. They delivered on the soul food.","Feeling adventurous? This is not your typical brunch spot. Food is generally good and some are experimental in a way. 'Mac n cheese pancake' was surprising good. Even balance of sweet and salty. Very heavy so get it, when you are really hungry.Nice outdoor seatings available on good sunny days. If you want traditional breakfast/brunch it may be not for you. Coffee can be better imo.","I really enjoyed the sidewalk seating. It gave us a nice breeze to enjoy while waiting for our food and drinks. I don't really know how I feel about the food yet. They have cool and funky menu items that you won't find anywhere else (Mac n cheese pancakes), but they also have safe items for the less adventurous (steak and eggs, brisket and eggs Benedict), so there's something for everybody. But the excitement doesn't last through the meal.The first couple bites are really something, but it gets old really fast. Specifically for the Mac and cheese because I couldn't take anymore bites after eating like a third of it.Maybe I'll go back in the future to try their other cool items but as of right now I'm holding off on that last star. Service, seating, and quality of food are upto par. The food just didn't taste as good as it sounded/ looked.",Mom's Kitchen & Bar
12,"If you're going to go on a weekend, reserve a table. They have poppin' ass drink and O M G the food is DOPE ASF! If you know someone who is ""seafood friendly"" I would highly recommend you bring them to this place.","This earns a SOLID 3 stars from me.  We came here for food and drinks ... mostly drinks! They were a little all over the place, three different people came to our table to take our order, drinks took forever and just to sit at a table it was a mission ... the place was practically empty.  Maybe we will give it a try in a couple of months to see if they got it together.  Overall the experience was okay.","We came here once before for drinks and a snack at the bar and service was amazing. However when we returned with friends to show them this place we were turned off with the service because our server wasn't friendly and of our entrees never came out and no one acknowledged that. We had to waive down a busser to track down our server and when she finally came over we told her about an entree that we never got and just to put it into perspective- our other guests were finishing their entree. So she went to check on it but it was too late and we had plans after dinner so we asked to just cancel the order and she never once apologized (as those in hospitality do) about our entree that she forgot to check up on or offered anything else because of her and the kitchens mistake. So with this said, even though the drink I ordered was good- sadly I don't think I'll be returning.",christine at the high water was BOMB.COM she was so respectful calm and collective despite witnessing rude customers and just overall cheery and vibrant so much of the vibe is the people who work there and she was ALL if I t. kudos.,"Indoor & outdoor seating availableStreet parking availableFree house cocktail shot with yelp check-inFinally got the opportunity to brunch here and I was really looking forward to it. I tried a loco moco and the gravy reminded me of jollibee's gravy. Their chicken & waffles is pretty good, although I couldn't taste much of the jalepenos in their house-made biscuit. The steak was cooked correctly to medium rare, as requested. Their guac and chips is good; an extra order of chips is $3. Service was friendly and our waters was consistently being refilled, which I appreciate. I would come back here for brunch in the future.","Happy hour M- F 3 - 7I wish they would do a weekend happy hour like most places.

Fantastic selection of drinks for just $8, including several pisco sours, all served with complimentary yuca chips and sauce.The food itself is good but hardly mind-blowing. The Arroz con Mariscos was hearty but too salty, and the Lomo Saltado (my litmus test for Peruvian restaurants) was a 7/10. Service started off terrible--they put us in a terrible location where servers kept bumping into us--but they eventually rectified the situation and gave us some complimentary apps to compensate.",Jora Restaurant & Bar
14,"I'll start off by saying that their boil sauce taste amazing and their potato was just soft enough and corn were flavorful and sweet. Their drinks are also really tasty also.  On to why I leave a review today.This place tasted great for a while, but recent delivery had tons of sand in their boiled clams, so much so that you can see literal sand patches on the clams.  Not sure if they didn't rinse the clams long enough, but it was crunchy like cheetos, and believe me that's not a good thing for clams.  The snow crabs had gotten really salty and wasn't a good combination with their recommended sauce :( .  The shrimps were also soft and pasty when you peel off the shell, which told us they weren't that fresh, even for frozen shrimp.  I never had issues until today, I guess their quality has dropped since their open, which sucks because I really liked this restaurant.",I was super excited that something like this opened up in the neighborhood but it is so disappointing. If this place doesn't change their food they will not last. The food is tasteless. It is missing salt in everything! Also there is no spice at all. How can this place be cajun/creole? First off cajun food doesn't even use old bay. Even the fries weren't good. I won't be going back here until they change the food. As for the service they were good an attentive but it could have been because there was only 1 other table other then mine. The decor is cute but too dark inside.,They're the absolute best ! The mac & cheese (with and without lobster) is delicious .,"I went here on a Saturday afternoon date with my wife. The atmosphere is fun. Very clean inside and everything is new. Fun decor on the wall and cool chairs and tables.The service was great. Friendly staff and attentive.We ordered the shrimp / dungeness crab combo, and the King Crab. The seafood was really fresh, the sauce was delicious.We had a great experience. We would certainly go back and recommend it to friends.","Four of us went to Oceanic Boil for dinner on a Saturday night and ordered fried calamari, soft shell crab, combo of 1 lb shrimp and whole lobster with oceanic boil sauce, 1 lb king crab legs with oceanic boil sauce and a side of sausages.The sausages had a nice spicy kick to it. The calamari and soft shelled crab were crunchy and good. It came with a spicy mayo sauce which was yummy and a side of fries which were tasty as well. The corn that came with it wasn't very good- it could have done without the corn.The lobster and king crab legs were full of meat and  so I would definitely recommend these. The shrimp was ok - they were kind of on the smaller side compared to other boil places I've been to. The oceanic sauce that came with it was subpar. It lacked real full flavor. The sauce could've been made slightly saltier and it really wasn't that memorable. I was disappointed by the oceanic boil sauce. I didn't try the other sauces though. Overall, I've had better seafood boils at other restaurants. Everything is in the sauce and the oceanic boil sauce was lacking. Other than that, the appetizers and sides were good and service is good too.","Oh Oceanic Boil how I love thee. I've been here 3 separate times and each time I leave satisfied. I love seafood (shrimp and crab legs are my absolute favorite) so when I saw the other yelp reviews I knew I had to check it out. I'm glad I did because the spicy garlic butter sauce is delicious! There is usually no wait for seats when I've come here so that's a plus. Speaking of seats, the ones here are not particularly comfortable but they work. The staff is delightful. Every server I've had and even the bartender at the back bar are always so helpful with suggestions on food and drinks. Tips: - The appetizers come with a side of Cajun fries (the fries are perfection) -  1 combo platter is enough for 2 people. - The calamari appetizer is decent. It comes with fries as I mentioned above so if you order the calamari you may get too full before your meal comes out. - I'm on the edge about the chicken wings appetizer. The first time I ordered them they were delicious and the second time I ordered them they were very crispy as we asked for but did not have much flavor. I had to use lots of hot sauce on them. - The combo platters come with corn and potatoes. The corn and potatoes are soaked in whatever sauce you ordered the seafood in. *This was not an issue for me but other people may not care for this. - I suggest trying the snow crab legs - Try the spicy garlic butter sauce. The spice level is mild. My favorite. I know I'll be back and maybe I'll try the fried lobster next time.",Oceanic Boil
15,"Went back again on a weekend. So disappointed that after 40 minutes we still did not get our food, which was just two arepas. We were told that our food would be put through before a large group but it didn't seem like the case. I loved their arepas last time, but I don't think I will be coming in for awhile. They need faster food prep time, especially if they can afford to have 3 people in the front.",I'm no arepa expert. I just thought it was flavorful and delicious. I split the chocolo queso and arepa de queso with pollo asado with my partner. I felt very full afterwards.,I really wanted to love this place but unfortunately it disappointed me. I tried the arepa for the first time in Boston so I might not know the real flavor but I was expecting something savory but what I got was something sweet. It wasn't bad but it wasn't as amazing as a lot of people have told me!,"A couple years ago, I went to the first Arepa Lady storefront location on Roosevelt Avenue after she had moved up from her cart. I heard that place had closed down but it had re-opened at a different address. Since we were in the mood for arepas, we decided to stop in.This location is much bigger than the old one and is about double the size. We tried three different types of arepa - arepa de choclo (sweet corn), arepa rellena (stuffed arepa) and arepa de queso (cheese). My favorite of the three is the choclo because of the sweet taste. But everything was delicious and had the same great quality and same great taste as before. There is a reason this place became so popular. Prices are reasonable too. Each one depending on what meat or filling you choose is about $5 to $8 each. Of course there are cheaper arepas to be had in hole in the walls, but in this case you are paying a tiny bit more for the quality and experience.","The ""Arepa Lady"" was a very popular Colombian lady with a street cart serving arepas in Jackson Heights. A couple years ago, she opened her own storefront and I decided to check it out. All I can say is that this place receives my highest recommendation.We tried a patacon (a tostone topped with meat and veggies) and two of the arepas. They were all very big and very delicious. The patacon we had with chicharron was a great combination - nice, savory taste  with the crispy bits of pork. I also especially liked the arepa de choclo. I recommend that type over the arepas. It is an arepa made of sweet corn  with such a rich taste to it. Everything here is very cheap too - around $5 to $8 for each offering..","Arepa Lady is fine. If you like heavy food, then get the cheese stuffed arepa. But be warned that it will also have cheese on top. SO MUCH CHEESE.Don't get the chorizo, because it's not ground sausage like I expected. It's just slices of sausage that was a little too reminiscent of hot dogs.The chicharron was top notch though.Note that they don't serve alcohol.",Arepa Lady
16,"This place attracted me from all the yelp reviews, but service, food, and drinks were all mediocre, maybe not even and definitely don't deserve all the appraisals. Their churrasco made it on my list of worst churrasco ever. They used very cheap skirt steak that was barely cooked. They slapped it on the grill for a second and called it a day. It was so chewy and bland even with all the sauce they poured on top. The jerk chicken wings were just wings drenched in some sauce, definitely not for someone who is going to try jerk chicken for the first time. The drinks were all cheaply made. My husband and I both woke up with stomach pain and headaches.","This place is okay. The drinks are very strong. But they need to work on placing sauces on the side. Not everyone want to be forced to have the sauce on the appetizer. Overall, the flavor is present.","I'm not sure of the positive reviews here. We had the empanadas (okay) and fried calamari that were a bit undercooked and mushy on the inside (gross). We had the skirt steak and paella as the main courses and boy, was the steak one of the toughest steak I've ever had? I could barely chew it through, it was honestly way too over cooked. I forced myself to eat this. The paella was more edible but the shrimp were not fresh, however the flavor of the dish was good. I ended up filling myself with the rice with beans because I just didn't feel like eating anything else. The waitress also gave us some attitude when we asked for an extra fork. The restaurant is narrow so the seating is extremely tight. This was not an enjoyable meal at all and I will be avoiding this place.","Cabana never disappoints. This place is always packed so make a reservation ahead of time! Most I've had to wait is 45 minutes which seems like a lot more time when you're hungry! The staff here is so lovely. Always making sure you are happy with your meal. I love the energy here. Come with your family, friends, on a date night. It's perfect for a lot of occasions! The food always comes out in a decent amount of time the mojitos here are very good! Overall highly recommend and will always come back for more!","Hands down the best Cuban food. I have eaten here on many occasions and they never disappoint with food or service.  I brought my parents here last night for dinner with my husband and my brother. My mother is particularly picky with where she eats and she absolutely LOVED the food. I have been trying to take my parents here for a while now, but usually the long wait time deters them from wanting to dine here and they don't take reservations. Since it was a bit later on a Sunday night, we were able to get in. It was packed! We had a wonderful waitress who helped us pick out the perfect bottle of red wine to have with our meal. I ordered the Pollo con Camarones. It was delicious. The shrimp and chicken were perfectly grilled and the garlic sauce was delicious. I usually order the arroz con pollo or camarones al ajillo, which I highly recommend. This was a good choice to switch it up. My father ordered the ropa Borja, which is a favorite of my husband. It was melt in your mouth delicious. My husband ordered the Chicharonnes de Pollo. They were perfectly fried chicken on the bone and the presentation was beautiful. They were not too oily and were very tasty.My mother ordered the Mariscados, which is a seafood mix. She and I are not usually the biggest scallop fans and she let me taste one of her scallops because she said they were so delicious. My brother ordered the Pollo al Ajillo and really enjoyed it. Paired with the excellent service by our waitress, I wish I got her name as well as the friendliness by the hostess and the wait staff and our food being so delicious, this restaurant is a definite go to. We always enjoy eating here and now I assume my parents will want to eat here every time they visit.","Delightful place!  I overheard a local brotha on the phone talking about how he's come to this place for YEARS, and how hidden of a gem it was....  He was right!I ordered the Churrasco streak, with a glass of Merlot, and it was sublime!I asked Pappi (the waiter) about cool rum drinks, and after a moment of indecisiveness, he was like, ""go for the traditional Rum & Coke!""....  Pappi was right!Sitting at their outside booth, I enjoyed a couple of RC's for dessert, and I was SOOOOO right! LOL!Brotha-man is right!  This place is a gem!  I know it's NYC, but the staff was warm and accommodating.Cheers, as I finish of the last of this RC",Cabana
17,"Chicken is tasty with s crunchy crust and juicy meat. Mac and cheese is an overpriced fail. We sent it back because it was cold and tasted bad, no flavor and was not cheesy. A small plate for fourteen dollars should be banging but this didn't even come close. The grits on the other hand were delicious. They are creamy and hearty. Waffles are okay.  The chaquillas are a mess. The flavors don't work well together: too many different textures. The dish also came out cold. The place has a chill vibe and the girl who greeted us was very nice but the waiting staff were not enthusiastic or friendly, just not a happy mood all around.Mera's Tip: try the grits","Thursday night late dinner. It was loud and difficult to hear and have a conversation. They provide three homemade butters- mixed berry, lemon honey, and herb butter The rosemary and mushroom waffle and chicken was yummy.","1) TOO LOUD. Holy crap, why the eff is it so freakin' loud even when you're sitting by the window? Did we walk into a Yodelers Convention?2) Pretentious service. I just want a straightforward answer about what's in this particular dish. I don't need your ironic snarcasm (snark + sarcasm) and ""What do YOU think is in it?"" mind games. #girlbye3) Underwhelming food. Shrimp and Grits - Under-seasonedFried Chicken and Waffles - Chicken too dry, waffle okayBraised Collard Greens - Not hammy enoughBrussels Sprouts - Burnt...?Rico Suave Bossa Nova - Decent cocktailThe Queen of New York - Also decent cocktail","There is NO reason to market and sell Chicken & Waffles. Mainly because Chicken & Waffles sell themselves! Just when Nas couldn't get any better, from a Queens native perspective, Mr. half man half amazing goes ahead and embarks his entrepreneurial spirit into an unbeatable food category. DELICIOUS CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. Sweet Chick has many options and variations of their delicious waffles and fried chicken. I've tried a bunch of them and can't decide a favorite, mainly because they're all so good. Try them all and you decide.","Have never been let down with Sweet Chick.Been to their L.I.C. and Williamsburg locations and i love them both equally. Their specialty waffles and delicious chicken have always been just enough to satisfy for a competitive price. The VIBE in their shops destroys anyone else who's still trying to define the meaning of the word.Excellent staff, music and speed of food delivery.I Love SWEET CHICK","Had a somewhat subpar visit to Sweet Chick today. Granted, it's Labor Day, and the wait for a table was 35+ minutes. My friend and I waited outside as the rain poured. When our table became available, we were happy to be back indoors. After glancing over the brunch menu, we both ordered breakfast burritos. It took a long time for them to arrive, but I found mine much to my liking. Eggs, chicken, gravy, etc., in a tortilla, panini-pressed. The side of potatoes was gratuitous; I took most of them to go.The service was spotty, and also $5 for a 12 oz. Narragansett feels exploitative. That said, I have no quarrel with the food I selected. Also, and totally not their fault, but a baby was screaming for most of my visit. Can't bring myself to give four stars, so three it is.",Sweet Chick
18,"Honestly I didn't enjoy the food here. We went on sunday for brunch and glad we got seated right away. The place is nice, clean and spacious. I expect too much about this diner because of yelp food pictures  and some reviews.For drink I ordered the iced caramel macchiato and I got the hot caramel macchiato. Not really happy about it because it cost $5 and the server said he's going to put iced on it. Hmm, I don't think thats a good idea. For food I got the chicken and waffle. In their menu it says black pepper maple syrup, arugula & tomato salad for $18. The food came and its chicken cutlet with a little spinach salad on the side. I didn't really like it. My bf got omelette and it was alright. Sorry but this is not the brunch spot for me.","Went to Dinerbar with friends for Sunday brunch. A completely terrible dining experience due to our incompetent and rude waiter. Bad enough to completely overshadow some solid breakfast food. Quality: It was not the food that was a problem at Dinerbar, it was the service. I think everyone in my party enjoyed their food, when they got it. The Pulled Pork Benedict was savory and the meat was extremely tender. While the Neapolitan French Toast Tower was perfect for a sweet tooth. However, the tasty food could not make up for the horrendous experience. Quantity: Good sized portions, especially the French Toast Tower.Value: $17 for the Pulled Pork Benedict. $15 for the Neapolitan French Toast Tower.Ambiance: Dinerbar is located in the Forest Hills area of Queens. They took the old school diner look and added some modern flair. The restaurant is spacious and full of light. They have a long bar area that does in fact serve drinks. And they have some televisions hanging up showing sports and highlights. The music is lively, helping add energy to Sunday brunch.Crowd: The restaurant was busy for Sunday brunch. It took about 5 minutes to get seated. However, the crowd was no excuse for the service.Service: Our waiter was absolutely terrible. He took our orders, but forgot to bring out our drinks. We had to grab someone else who then had to hunt down him down. When they found him he asked me what my order was. Apparently he put in the rest of the order, but not mine. So when the food came out it was not too surprisingly to see my food missing. Luckily, my friend was willing to share because it wasn't until 10 minutes after everyone else finished that my food finally showed up. There was no apology though, instead he hounded over our table when he saw me ask for the check. An extremely uncomfortable way to end a horrible brunch.Parking: A fair amount of street parking nearby.",The food was not great at all the only thing I can say about this lace is that the service was great and the manager took my drink off because my food was not good and my girlfriend they took her food off all together because she did not enjoy it so for that I'm thankful but I was still very disappointed In The food. But my sangria was delicious.,"Came to Dinerbar which can be described as an upscale diner with a bar with lounge decor on a Saturday afternoon. Although it was packed, we were greeted immediately upon entry and seated. Service was great- the staff were all professional and friendly. Food was delicious! I also have to say- I love brunch and if you're looking to have a wonderful brunch experience- try Dinerbar!","Decisions decisions....I want to go for the soft shell crab Benedict with the side of salad but then I see the basil and cheese grits with bacon. I was thinking the SSC with a side of grits but ultimately we wanted it all. So we asked to order the lobster Benedict with a side salad, the basil and cheese grits with poached eggs, and asked if we can get a side of fried softshell crab for the both of us. Problem solved. The waiter said that that they couldn't do that. I don't know if it's their policy, but he didn't even ask the manager or the chef. This is very upsetting, as I deliberated a long time to get everything that I wanted. I don't know if they're normally this inflexible, but the place was quite crowded for a Labor Day weekend. I'm happy to see the business is doing well. As I said before, the food is so good and every time I go, the place is pretty empty which worried me. Maybe the kitchen was extremely busy and not prepared for such a busy lunch hour on a normally would be dead weekend. The food came out extremely slow which is OK since I had some catching up to do with my friend but the inflexibility of the menu was disappointing.While the food was usually pretty close perfect, it wasn't this time. One of the eggs on my friend's lobster Benedict was completely overcooked while the other one was nice and soft. When I requested a replacement egg, it took almost 10 minutes to receive it. Since we weren't able to get the fried softshell crabs on the side, we ordered a third entrée from the dinner menu which was pan-fried softshell crabs with some sort of salsa. It was not good at all. The combination was strange and it just didn't complement the soft shell crab. We barely even touched it. The pan-fried crabs were not nearly as good as the deep-fried crabs which was not even an entree option on the menu nor were we given an option to pay extra for it on the side. Yes, we could've just ordered another breakfast entrée but that only came with one softshell crab and we each wanted one. Needless to say, I was disappointed and embarrassed because I was so excited to have her try this place.","This will definitely be my go-to place from now on. Food and service is excellent every time, don't know why this place isn't more crowded.",Dinerbar
19,I've been dying to try this place out for the longest time since I saw a couple of my friends posting the food from here. I've always been a big fan of them steamed rice rolls...especially with shrimp .I ordered the shrimp roll. It came topped with scallions and your typical sauces. It was pretty good. My only beef with this place is that it's just a tiny bit pricey but don't let this stop you from ar least trying it.,"Best soft steamed noodle roll I've had. Dirt cheap, crowded as heck, need to find a counter space/stool in middle of an inside mini mall. Not the cleanest but think of this as street food and it's all good.Food is where it's at. Got shrimp roll with three veggies. Even though I got small, it's plentiful.Next to busy subway bus junction in flushing, tons of traffic.","After eating the rice roll at Fu Yuan (which is a block away), I was a bit disappointed at Joe's rice roll. We ordered the barbeque pork steamed rice roll, Chinese pancake (we chose pork floss) & a cup of fresh soy milk. The rice roll was very soft and smooth, but was very thin (I preferred the thicker rice rolls more). The rice roll did taste good, but a bit bland in my opinion (had to add a lot of hot sauce on it). The Chinese pancake was good, but very oily. The fresh soy milk was a big disappointment - the drink felt dilated w/ water (did not taste much soy in it).","Come for the rice rolls, pass on the jianbing.Rice rolls were silky smoooooth! SMOOOOTH!The shrimp were fresh and had a nice pop! Service speed is ok. This is a hole in awhile type of place, soo, dont mind the cleanliness. Skip the jianbing, it just doesnt taste very good.","I would eat this everyday if I could. My bf and I came right before the rush and managed to snag a seat at the counter. Seating is VERY limited so a lot of people ended up taking it to-go. I love that the kitchen was so transparent. You can watch them make each steamed rice roll. It looked so simple but I'm sure it's an intricate process. My bf and I shared the shrimp and beef steamed rice rolls with cilantro, scallions, and corn. We topped our rolls with chili oil which made it taste even better. Each steamed rice roll was silky soft and scrumptious. Our favorite was the shrimp. The only negative things I have to say is that the cashier is sorta rude and some of them don't speak English. They were calling out numbers in Chinese and we couldn't understand them.TLDR: The steamed rice rolls are absolutely incredible but get here before the rush if you want a place to sit.","Best churng fun (steamed rice rolls) ever. They're made fresh-to-order, soft, silky, and oh so delicious.I love the simple concept of being able to customize my order by adding in toppings. Their house made chili oil is the cherry on top.Please come to LA.",Joe's Steam Rice Roll
20,Too saucy for my taste. Not a fan of saucy cuisine but I decided to give it a try. I was told that I couldn't have my appetizer before my meal. It had to eat it with my main course which defeats the purpose. Salad portion was too small and I wasn't impressed the eggplant was drowned in cheese and sauce and wasn't flavorful as I hoped it would be. I found the food to be more like a fast food chain than a restaurant.,This has been my 3rd time at the restaurant.. each time we have gone it has been an overall good experience. Last night we had gone back again. I am always interested in hearing the specials .. as the waiter read the specials he spoke about a truffle pasta. When I further inquired about the dish his words were it's very good totally worth it..After that I decided to order the dish. After the pasta came I said to my boyfriend it was good but not the best thing I had eaten there.Once the bill arrived we realized the small mediocre dish was priced at 100 dollars.. 100 dollars for one dish of pasta? That is something that should be told prior to ordering. As someone who has gone to expensive restaurants their entire life this turned my stomach.As an establishment it should be noted to express prices that are out of the ordinary for a tiny dish of pasta. When we asked for the check the waiter never brought it nor did he pick up the bill.. instead he sent the bus boy.. it was not busy at this time..It was clear he was avoiding the conversation Bc he knew that we would be upset..As a family establishment it should be an experience to treat customers as family. This was a very upsetting meal and will make me never return to the restaurant.,"I attended a dinner lecture and had high hopes the food would be superb.When one of the waiters opened an end piece of table into my leg to make room for a late attendee, I knew it was over for me. During the whole time, the servers were brashly rushed. They seemed so annoyed to be catering to us! The food was not great either. The tomato, pale and unripe, and mozzarella had no balsamic on it. The rigatoni was again dry, barely any tomato sauce. The cod I ordered was tasteless. I can only compliment them on refilling constantly refilling our wine glasses.First impressions are lasting impressions.",We went here on Sunday with a friend visiting from Florida. We have been here many times and the food and service never disappoints. It is so nice that Rocco the owner stops at every table to speak with his customers.This is one of our favorite dining spots.,"Had dinner with my family on Saturday evening, made a reservation and seated immediately. Started with Zucchini Flowers stuffed with ricotta and mozzarella. They were excellent.  I had the veal chop Milanese, pounded nice and thin with a wonderful salad on top. Excellent!  Wife and daughter had a black pasta with lobster they both loved it. My other daughter had a pasta with a lemon sauce she said it was great as well. All of us ordered specials which were great. Rocco the owner came over to the table next to us and then turned his attention to us as I'm from the same region of italy he is from.  He made sure we werewell cared for and gave us a bottle of wine. That was very thoughtful.  The restaurant is top notch if you are looking for authentic Italian food.  Don't pass it up. Make a reservation as it was busy because the food is so good.","There is nothing in this world that compares to the food that is served at Trattoria L'incontro. Our dining & culinary experience was absolutely remarkable. The servers bent over backwards to make sure we were accommodated and satisfied through every course of our meal. My table shared the Burrata to start, and it tasted like a piece of heaven. 100% recommend this dish to any cheese lover, even if you are skeptical of burrata cheese. We then tried a house special, ravioli with asparagus and a light sauce- wonderful! My guests both had veal entrees and I asked for specially-made penne vodka which was out of this world. Seriously, nothing beats this place!! We were able to meet the head chef, Rocco Sacramone when he personally came out of the kitchen to ask about our dining experience. Wine & dessert were fabulous. Even had a complimentary birthday dessert  Would absolutely return!!!",Trattoria L'incontro
21,"Once upon time in Manhattan's East Village I had my first flavored martini. Sipping on the Raspberry Mule-Tini took me back...way back, which is such a rare thing these days with all the artisanal and hipster spots taking over all corners of Astoria. The service and the vibes between staff and locals was everything I would want from a neighborhood pub. Too bad I live in Brooklyn now, but for a moment I got to pretend that I didn't.","This is a 3.5. We first came for brunch which I would give them a 4-star rating for. The food was pretty good and our waiter, Akiles was awesome and super friendly. We went back for dinner one night and we wanted to sit at the bar. The bartender barely spoke to us and just kind of threw menus at us. When we couldn't get her attention, we decided to take a table. Our server was much better, but the food didn't really wow us. I got the turkey club, which really didn't have much love put into it. I would go back for brunch and to sit outside but that's all they really have to offer.",Nice staff  unique  look...they know how t ok make not only me happy but my family  as well.Its my first time and it wont be my last.,"My friends and I really needed a bathroom at like 10 at night. No one was willing to let us use the bathrooms, even Dunkin Donuts ! The people at the bar were closing up and cleaning, and they very generously, let us use their bathrooms! They deserve a 5 star for great service!!! If I am in the area again, I will definitely visit and give myself the chance to experience it !","I had high hopes based on rating here.Rushed service. ts ts. I'm in the restaurant industry so naturally my expectations are higher than most I suppose?. Ruth came up to the table 3x within 10 min. Saturday night .. it's a nice night out.. we're with friends.. laughing n talking.. no one needs to feel rushed lady. Take it easy. It wasnt even busy! I would understand if they needed the table. But hey. Not my circus not my monkeys man!The food was ok. I appreciated the attempt to be creative, but the execution didnt add up. The quesadilla was hard to eat and was falling apart due to the way it was cut, as was the burger (no bun.. comes on an english muffin?? Wtf).. that was a struggle to eat happily. Food shouldnt be hard to eat. You killed it for me, please don't make me work for it in the end hahahThe drinks were good at least. Thanks Malibu pineapple. I'll be back but only bc the hostess was cute.","5 stars for our server, Chris!  He's one of the most charismatic people you'll ever meet.  His service definitely made our brunch a fun time.The banana walnut pancakes are a dream.  Banana can be hit or miss, but topped with fresh berries and even blueberry syrup is well-balanced.  My friend got the Kale Caesar salad, and although [IMO] way too healthy for brunch, she seemed to enjoy it.Thanks again to Chris for the awesome service.  We will be back!",Trestle
22,"Let me start off with this looks nicer of the outside than it is on the inside, service was ok the only part I found interesting was there signature drinks are very unique.I came here with my brother and his fiancé  for my birthday and it was the worse decision I have made in a while. We ordered they special for the day; crab meat and shrimp sliders ( not sure if this is where I went wrong but I believe it was) and for entrees we ordered:Pork Chops, Lamb Gyro and someone sort of lemon chicken with the wildfire drinks. All I know is that 45 minutes into the dinner I started to feel sick so I asked to leave. I wish that where my story ended but I instead ended up with 3 days of a stomach virus with not stop vomiting and the runs which was either a stomach virus or food poisoning  either way I would NEVER come back here again!","Came by here for lunch at around 12 on a Friday; surprisingly the place was empty. The server was friendly and attentive. The menu is not vast so choosing comes easily except everything seems bland. I got the braised beef burger with Greek salad and the salmon with feta cheese salad. The salmon was about 4 oz, very little for $15. The salad it sat on wasn't enough as well. The burger's meat was juicy with bbq sauce, but covered in a thick layer of American cheddar cheese; Nobody need that much bad cheese on anything. I didn't see where it said cheese so I didn't bother to have them remove it. But It wasn't easy to remove due to the sticky nature of the cheese to the meat. Overall, I wouldn't waste money here again. The price for quality is not worth it.",Nick's is a decent Greek restaurant.  Living in Richmond Hill there's not many places to choose from.  That being said I think it is way over priced for the quality of food that you get.  The food is good but the 20 min drive to Astoria is the way to go.,I have come here for lunch a dinner and have never been disappointed. This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in Forest Hills.The food is absolutely delicious from salmon over salad to Greek chicken wraps and gyros. The price is right for dinner and they also have a great lunch special.,"Cuisine: 5Service: 7Decor: 6Value: 7Overall: 6Confused. I don't get why this restaurant has a strong 4.5 star rating when I have never experienced extraordinary food or impeccable service after numerous visits. I keep giving it another try thinking I must be missing something, but at last, I don't think so. Unfortunately, Nick's is just an average restaurant.First of all, knowing it's a Greek restaurant, we have tried many authentic Greek dishes in the past. Nothing bad, but nowhere near the quality of what you can get in Astoria. Maybe people around here settled for subpar Greek/Mediterranean food, but I rather drive all the way to Astoria.Today, stopped in with a friend for a quick bite. I got the Lamb Gyro Sandwich and he ordered a Porcini Cheeseburger. Gyro was fine but nothing to rave about. The burger however needed to be returned since it was super well done and not medium rare at all.  On the second go around, it was well done again, but we ran out of time to return it. Took a few bites and ran.Servers were friendly enough, did not complain when we sent back the food and apologized for the mistake. Yet, they never came back to check on the new burger, which was slightly better but still not what my friend ordered. Oh well, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me a half dozen times, I'm a complete idiot. Lol","What a great restaurant this is! Service, food, neighbourhood are all impeccable. We stopped there because of outdoor seating and is pretty friendly. My daughter had what we all agreed were the best pancakes we have ever had. She also had their chicken noodle soup...excellent also. My wife and I opted for more Greek dishes...pork souvlaki with lemon potatoes, lamb burger, and appetizer of Taramasalata. All were unbelievably delicious and we'll presented.Our writers were attentive and very helpful. All in all, we were very happy and will return.",Nicks Bistro
23,"The space is nice and rustic but that's not enough to upcharge at Manhattan price, especially if the food is so inadequate and corners are being cut. Their waitress was also not very knowledgeable of the menu. The biscuits and gravy was sad to say the least. The gravy was runny and almost sweet, and it was served over white bread???! How can you even put that on your menu as biscuit... If you look into their photos, there are some customers with the square white bread and then others had bisquits. The poached egg was firm and overcooked. The avocado toast was so expensive and it wasn't even good. The avocado spread was not chunky or fresh. It was sour and a thinned out spread that tastes and looks just like the prepackaged Sabra guac you get from the supermarket. The greens that came with it looked wilted/yellowing... The poached egg was slightly better than the one on the biscuits and gravy but it was definitely overcooked. By far one of the saddest brunches that I overpaid for and walked out dissatisfied.",Nice new place to eat. Tables are really small. Service was ok. Brunch was ok. But we were not fans of the apple maple sausage.,Food is terrible. I would never eat here again. Steak was cold. Pizza had peaches??and cheese. Gross.,"The style says come in, the windows are grand, the atmosphere is inviting, the reggae music was gentle, the staff was warm - welcome to Queensboro!This Brooklyn-esque  restaurant is definitely a notable addition to Northern Blvd, Jackson Heights area.Although Queensboro is a gastropub, the menu is very innovative and the dishes are very flavorful.  The chef goes to great length to ensure all dishes are well presented with unwavering flavors; whether it be savory or sweet.We were here for Sunday brunch and was not disappointed.  My husband had the sweet potato chorizo hash and sunny eggs and I had the pancakes with dulce de leche butter.  Portion size was normal, presentation was great, and taste was superb.  After brunch we lingered a bit longer and enjoy some cocktails.  The bar tender actually came to our table to make sure he understood what I wanted, it was nothing fancy, just a classic kir.  Overall my experience made it worthwhile to write this review. Looking forward to dinner soon.","What can I say? Those Benedicts are solid! Although it will be nice if it include some salad on the side. Coffee had a slight sourness to it. Not my favorite. The chocolate croissant was probably the worst out of the three things. It doesn't have the fluffness. Maybe not fresh?Service was attentive. Manager came by to check on us as well. Atmosphere- rustic, spacious and comfortable Parking- easy on Saturday afternoon. Plenty of street parkingThey also have a bar...","This place is a neighborhood gem - it's charming and spacious, with a truly New American menu that showcases global flavors. The menu exceeds expectations for a gastropub, in my opinion. My friend and I came on Thursday night and sat at the bar. The bartender, Emily, was absolutely wonderful. She had great recommendations for the special dishes of the night (we ordered the steamed eggplant appetizer and the green seafood curry from that part of the menu). She was attentive and friendly, and made delicious drinks. She really makes the customer feel at home! I wish I lived closer to Jackson Heights - I'd be a regular at the bar!The food, too, is cooked with skill - the seafood in the curry was perfectly cooked and tender. Importantly, the dishes were not overly salted or oiled. We also ordered the watercress salad with asparagus, but I'd love to come back to try the other salads and the sweet potato scallion pancake appetizer.",The Queensboro

Over the past few years, I've eaten here numerous times and have always left happy. The food and service are fantastic (the former, fresh; the latter, simply awesome). Everyone is friendly and you never feel like you're being rushed in any way. And while this isn't billed as a ""farm-to-table"" joint, it might as well be; plates are varied and flavorful, and the portions are ample without being overwhelming. A few other pluses: they have Oatly (without a surcharge); they carry Nine Pin cider (some of NY's finest); and they have a (covered) backyard space that's cozy and secluded.",Excellent tasty and fresh foods.

25,"Not fresh seafood.  Our crab was still cold inside. When we asked, the waitress said that not possible as they use fresh seafood. Only then to ask her to find out from the kitchen and apparently it is not live but frozen seafood. Very disappointed that we were misinformed from the beginning","Saturday lunch. We ordered a bag of mix that was steamed in their signature sauce. You'd think that with the sauce it will be flavorful but not even close. The meat didn't really observe the sauce as it should. The salmon salad was unexpected tasty, but overly priced for a salad. The crab cake was tasty, they used real crab meat. It was soft and seasoned well. Overall, I won't go out of my way to come here. Parking is terrible to find and some items were over priced.","Probably A Bad Night. Only Speaking From My Own Experiences.Seafood Is Seafood.

Seafood is expensive everywhere so why not go to a place where the seafood is amazing?! One other thing to note is that they have happy hour EVERY DAY from 4-7pm on drinks AND food!!!We came with a few friends so we were able to get many dishes off the menu. The only thing I didn't like was the raw clam because I don't like them in general, but we had an assortment of grilled, raw, fried oysters, clam pasta, garlic bread, chicken wings...and DAMN their chicken wings are on point - they get their chicken crispier than fried chicken places!The seafood boil was great - delicious, fresh crab legs and shrimp. We added the corn, potatoes, sausage and rice cakes to the boil and it did not disappoint - how could it not be good soaking in the sauce?! We thought the rice cakes were particularly ingenious! I think it's great that they have non-seafood dishes on the menu so everyone has something to eat. But their desserts are also banging - try the mango souffle or the coconut pudding.Service was great - waiters and busboys on point, but the owner of the place is really friendly and funny. He's got this exuberant energy about him and gives really good recommendations if you don't know what to order. Hats off to the beautiful bartenders - the drinks are strong and delicious!",It was fun and their adult Capri Suns are cool. Their garlic pasta tho?

Recommended by a friend.We had a party of 4 plus a baby and his stroller.First, we were greeted by a hostess who was lacking in the hospitality industry,  no smile all attitude.  She first seated us in a half empty restaurant at a half shared table for 8 and told us to park the stroller in the corner of the restaurant.  So where's the baby going to sit? We asked for a table in the back where it was still empty, so the stroller can seat the baby by the table.  She unwillingly walked us back there.Then we were greeted by a waiter who started off helpful & nice, but ended up to be rude.Happy hour 3pm-7pm...  use their qr code to get a menu... ok fine As we are skimming through their electronic menu, the waiter decided that since we ordered happy hour items, appetizers, drinks, and an entree, to take our paper menus away. Even though we asked to keep one menu, he said the menu on the phone is the same as the paper version.   He wasnt so happy when he was told that the phone was dying.We tried to ordered a tray of uni, but they were out. So opted for the uni pasta, interestingly enough they had uni for pasta.  Then tried to order the Mushroom Risotto with A5 Miyazaki Wagyu from their special of the day section of the menu, was told that it was an appetizer.  They should have indicated on the menu because I'm looking at this as an entree.  What appetizer is priced $30?Ended up ordering rack of lamb (it was a small lamb only 3 chops).Overall,  it was good food with mediocre service. Best bring good company to offset their service.3 stars for service, 5 stars for food",Naked Crab
26,"I'm going to give this place 3 stars based only on my customer experience. Food is great and our server was amazing. Our bad experience was with Ester, I don't know if she was a manager or a hostess but damn her attitude was horrible and she was hella condescending. We asked for them to split the bill and our awesome server was about to help us when she abruptly interrupted our conversation, she then proceeded to split our bill in two which uh duh we could've done ourselves. They only take AMEX and cash so bring cash or you'll pay a $3.00 convenience fee to use their ATM machine.  The worst part about this whole situation was when we gave our waiter the money to pay for our bill she took it from his hands. I just hope he gets his tip because he deserves it.  Voy a darle a este lugar 3 estrellas solo en función de mi experiencia como cliente. La comida es excelente y nuestro servidor fue increíble. Nuestra mala experiencia fue con Ester, no sé si era gerente o anfitriona, pero maldita sea, su actitud era horrible y ademas condescendiente. Pedimos  que dividieran  la factura y nuestro increíble servidor estaba a punto de ayudarnos cuando ella interrumpió abruptamente nuestra conversación, luego procedió a dividir nuestra factura en dos, lo cual podríamos haber hecho nosotros mismos.Solo aceptan AMEX y efectivo, así que traiga efectivo o pagará una tarifa de conveniencia de $ 3.00 para usar su cajero automático. La peor parte de toda esta situación fue cuando le dimos a nuestro camarero el dinero para pagar nuestra factura, ella le quitó el dinero de las manos de una manera irrespetuosa. Solo espero que reciba su propina porque se lo merece","This place is hidden gem , the wait was very short despite it being so small . The waitress that night was quite personable , funny and knowledgeable about their menu . The food was on point , the sangria could use some work as it was very weak ! The prices are also very inexpensive","Flew call the Way from San Francisco Ca to The US OPEN and a Friend of mine told me about this Place n QuéenS New York,Customer Service was Êxcellent FooD was what i was Êxpecting REAL COMIDA CUBANA","Very easy to pass this place, nothing fancy outside or inside decor wise.  However, food and service was excellent.  Staff was very attentive and I thoroughly enjoyed every dish.Had the Codfish fritters as an appetizer. Shared the ropa vieja, and oxtail entrees that came with 2 sides each.  Sides were 2x yellow rice, yuca and fried plantains.I highly recommend everything I ordered, ropa vieja is a must, might be the best I've ever had.","Located in a bustling area between junction Blvd and Roosevelt Avenue is this little gem. Tucked away is this rustic Cuban restaurant serving up delicious food and a cool island vibe with its photos and memorabilia of Cuba on the walls. It is not an upscale place but it is warm and inviting with an atmosphere perfect for a cozy dinner with that special someone or family. I ordered the red sangria and jupina both equally delicious but who doesn't love sangria so I would opt for that next time I visit . We ordered the fried green plantains, rice and beans cooked with bacon, roasted pork and of course their famous Cuban sandwich with a side of drench fries. Let's start off with those rice and beans .... could I have a whole pot of those to go ? So delicious so flavorful .... I couldn't get enough of it and paired with the roasted pork covered in their garlic sauce it was bliss in every bite . The fried green bananas also amazing and super crunchy.their Cuban sandwich really is delicious I truly enjoyed the fact that there was a good bread to filling ratio and that the bread was nicely toasted and super crunchy. My only issue were the fries being a little too oily. Overall an amazing culinary experience and i will definitely be back for more of that rice and beans !","The place is lovely. Very Cuban feeling The YuCa Rellena app was crispy and tasty. But the Shrimp in Garlic Sauce needed to have the garlic taste, but the shrimp was cooked perfectly. Presentation of the shrimp dish was nice. Rice and Beans tasted good. My boyfriend said the Sangria was ok. Payment: they accept only American Express or cash. The service was satisfactory.",Rincon Criollo
27,Had dinner here with a friend for restaurant week. Hostess was great at seating us though we were 15 min late for our reservation. Waiter didn't present the restaurant week menu until we asked for it. The options on that menu weren't appealing so I went for the regular menu. Drink prices are a bit outrageous for the amount of drink you get. The lamb I ordered as soon as I tasted it it didn't sit well with me. I got half way through it and my stomach was upset the whole night. I wouldn't return here to try anything else from the menu. The prices are high for the mount of food you get and it seems too fancy for location.,"The food is heavenly, my favorite restaurant in NY but the restaurant is extremely cold, to the point that I didn't enjoy the dinner as much.","Great place and I go there regularly. Only downside is the GM is an unfriendly stiff and should not be front of house. You need anything, go to Anthony instead.","We loved our experience at Maiella and our waitress Karen. She was the perfect balance of service and humor. All of the workers were extremely attentive and helpful to the point where 1. I was looking around for the bathroom and a worker came up to ask if everything was ok. He directed me to the bathroom after I answered.  2. The workers refolded any unattended napkins. When I came back my napkin had been refolded and I noticed the same magic happen for the tables around me whenever someone got up and left their napkin behind.We had an 8:15 reservation on a Saturday night I would say that a reservation is absolutely  necessary as the restaurant was filled and everyone who came in around the same time that we did- had a reservation. We were seated immediately which speaks to the organization of the hostesses!The lighting is intimate which makes it ideal for couples. We noticed a lot of families as well. The music is extremely loud (but good..they were playing 70s hits) so it wouldn't be great for trying to get to know someone.Now let's get to the food/drinksFor drinks I ordered the mango rum and he ordered the Berry Azure. They were so sweet and you could barely taste the liquor.The sun dried tomato oil with focaccia bread was the most amazing oil/dip/spread anything I've ever had. I really could have come for the view and that oil and would have been the happiest of all. I ordered the fettuccine maiella- tableside which was made right in front of me. There were flames and the wine was infused into the pasta in a huge pot. The cheese was extremely fresh and smelled wonderful. I've never been so happy with an entree in my life!He ordered a special from that night which was a "" seafood party ""He liked the dish but definitely preferred mine.For dessert he ordered the triple layer chocolate cake and I ordered the Italian bread pudding. We both preferred my order- the Italian bread puddingAll and all amazing restaurant. Cannot wait to come again. I still dream about the fettuccine and sun dried tomato oil","One the few places available for restaurant week in Queens, we decided to check it out we also happen to be celebrating an anniversary they were nice in wishing us a happy one, Since it was a nice day we opted for sitting outside lovely seating area would have been better had the dam mosquitos stayed away... so annoying. After being seated we started with a bottle of Pinot Gricio - Le Rime Toscana good wine, went well with our food. They start u off with some Bread & a tomato paste, this was not bad good taste to the tomato paste, great for dipping the bread.  Limited menu for restaurant week, appetizers we tried the Burrata & Lamb meatballs , the meatballs were great nice taste practically melts in your mouth.. Now I love Burrata but this one was ok for me wasn't really feeling the figs on it. Main dishes we had the Ravioli & Roasted chicken, very good ravioli, stuffed w ricotta, nice tasting sauce .. the roasted chicken came with some veggies & polenta fries great tasting chicken good flavor to the meat, good fries the veggies were ok. For dessert we had the Budino di Pane , wow this bread pudding was amazing, great taste with the salted caramel & the cookies & cream gelato also had the Mirenga a mirengue cake good taste to the cake with the vanilla custard. Lovely restaurant, nice decor inside & outside u have a peek of the waterfront area, service was good although a bit slow price wise decent prices from what we noticed aside from the restaurant week menu, we enjoyed our meal & will probably be back for another visit,","This place has been on my radar for a while. I finally went with a friend during Summer Restaurant Week last month. The interior is elegant, classy, sophisticated and beautiful with larger than life windows, wood ceilings, along with green, yellow and white color scheme. The front area was charmingly decorated with a chalkboard sign spelling out ""Welcome"" in Italian and English, plants in vases, and a tree-like plant of green leaves and pink flowers. The bar area is a circular shape not too far from the front entrance. The dining area is a lovely sight to behold! Toward the back, there is a kitchen prep counter with meats hanging from above and beyond that is an outdoor patio area with a view of the Pepsi sign in Gantry State Park. For my appetizer, I decided on the lamb meatballs which consisted of pistachios and pecorino fondue. This was served on a cast iron grill on top of a wood board. There were 4 lamb meatballs sizzling in an abundant amount of pecorino cheese. The lamb was incredibly juicy, tender and full of flavor, while the cheese was perfectly melt in your mouth delicious. I also got to try the Burrata, made of mozzarella, sundried tomato, prosciutto, fig, and honey.  This was refreshing and the ingredients paired well together. I ordered the Branzino for the entree, which came with green beans, roasted potatoes, and almonds. The Branzino was a thin white sliver of fish in a sauce that I did not like. There was something about the taste of the fish itself that also didn't agree with me. The waiter allowed me to select a different dish, which I appreciated. The waiter recommended the pesto goat cheese ravioli which did sound lovely, however, I went for the oven-roasted half chicken. The chicken came with peppers and onions, as well as 2 pieces of polenta fries. Per the menu, it was supposed to come with butternut squash and I expected more polenta fries, so I was slightly disappointed. I enjoyed the chicken though. The meat was succulent and dripping with flavorful and well-seasoned sauce. The vegetables were tasty and fresh, while the polenta fries were crispy and wonderful with the accompanying mayo-based sauce.As we continued our meal, my friend and I witnessed a couple of guests getting the tableside pasta service where a wheel of cheese was melted in front of their eyes and added to a pan of cooking pasta. I believe some versions included truffle. It was quite a sight to experience and that smell was truly aromatic! I had a tough time choosing a dessert but finally decided to try the Pannetone bread pudding with salted caramel, along with cookies and cream gelato. It was the right decision! There was salted caramel custard on the bottom with a satisfying size of bread and a nice scoop of gelato with a drizzle of caramel on top. The bread pudding was absolutely delectable... The right amount of outer crunch, inner moistness, thickness, and sweetness. Gelato was delightfully creamy and had the pure taste of cookies and cream. The caramel tied everything together beautifully. The service was top notch with informed recommendations by the waiter and always making sure we were satisfied. I would like to return to try the pasta!",Maiella
28,If I could leave no stars I would. The manager or whomever the rude douche in the suit is is the DEVIL. This place does not value its customers. Service is terrible. They have a weird arrogance about their establishment and food was bad. Avoid.,"Most bizarre experience ever. My two friends took me out for dinner without a reservation. We were seated by the host. A few minutes later, the owner, Mario, came over to us and demanded in a very loud, rude yelling-tone ""Who seated you ...? We were taken aback by his rudeness.  We sat there a few minutes soaking in what just transpired. We ultimately decided to leave.  But before doing so, I asked the owner if I could have a word.  The owner, yelled at me in front of other diners, exhorting ""No"" and yelling to get the f %#@out of his restaurant.  The owner, Mario, acted unprofessionally and seems to have anger issues.  In response to the wife's owner -- no we did not lie.  We passed your restaurant and saw that there was a parking lot, we tried to pull over, the lot was full.  We didn't  hear the parking attendant say whether we had a reservation across the street in the car due to the loud din of the street.  We did hear him say ""turn around"".  Why would we lie?  You would find out anyway?  Madam your establishment is a restaurant in Corona, Queens, not Le Bernadin or Per Se.  Hmmm, not worth lying!You admitted your husband was rude and was very unprofessional, I rest my case.  Your staff at least were professional as they apologized on Mario's behalf -- and so did you!","Most bizarre experience ever.

My only regret is that I did not discover this place on the day it opened. I would be a regular from the start. Well, they say it's never too late.  A good thing because tomorrow I'm making more than one reservation. This restaurant gets everything ( and I mean everything)  right - including the gentleman valet, Anthony.  The Italian food could not be more authentic and wonderful.  I am reminded, again, why I fell in love with Italian food. I could write paragraphs about the dishes:  The quality, the preparation, the generous portions - the authentic homemade experience of it all - including the biscotti at the end. (Oh! So THAT'S what a biscotti is supposed to taste like! I will never enjoy store-bought again.)BTW, we originally decided to come here because we heard they had a dress code and that on Friday and/or Saturday nights it is child-free. How wonderful to have a truly romantic evening surrounded by nicely dressed adults. It makes a difference to us. Maybe it will to you too.",The food was phenomenal from start to finish. Excellent value for all the items we ordered. Compliments to the staff who waited our table. They were very attentive and professional. Please be aware that this is a cellphone free establishment. So keep your phone on silent and off the table.,"Alright alright, everyone just calm down. It's okay to put your phone away for just a moment and enjoy a classic italian setting with authentic italian cuisine, and Talk to each other! We came to this restaurant on a Saturday at 4pm for a friends birthday, there were 8 of us. The Owner Mario greeted us and showed us to our table. When everyone arrived he asked us if we were ever there before (our first time) and then let us know that we would have to go outside if we needed to use our phones. This rule is by far Genius! We have group dinners often and this was probably the best group dinner we ever had because of this rule! We laughed and talked A Lot throughout the meal and even got closer (although we have all known each other for more than 20 years). Again, this concept is simply Genius and I welcome it! Now on to the amazing food!The olive oil is shipped from Italy, I could drink that olive oil ! Its strong but if you know good olive oil, you will Love theirs! The waiter comes around and tells you what they are known for: homemade limoncello, homemade desserts, homemade pasta, imported olive oil, homemade red wine (very smooth, not too dry, light bodied with a soft hint of fruit). WE HAD EVERYTHING I JUST MENTIONED. ABSOLUTELY PERFECT IN EVERY WAY. The fish special atop risotto was a major hit. I had the chicken marsala which was light and cooked perfectly...this was Real marsala sauce (which is supposed to be a light sauce just this way) with perfectly sauteed mushrooms. We all tasted each others dishes and throughout the meal each person was impressed with the next person's dish (lots of Mmmmnnn's).For dessert we had the divine panacotta with sugar muddled berries on top (it's like nectar!). The homemade biscotti was perfect and damn they really make the perfect cup of joe! The cannoli creme was also a big hit. The tiramisu was soooooo good too! The panacotta and Tiramisu and Biscotti were My favorites. Mario the Owner was fabulous as was his staff. These are gentlemen!  It's evident that this Owner treats his establishment like his home. And I respect that.  He also belted out his strong voice when they all sand a hearty Happy Birthday to our friend (he has a pretty good voice btw!). This was a great day and very nice dining experience. Go and enjoy this rare unique establishment.  I cant wait to go back and try more of their dishes! Thank you Il Triangolo for the lovely experience and helping us make our friends birthday nothing short of Just Perfect!",IL Triangolo Restaurant
29,"I came here on a Sunday evening & luckily there was no wait & my friend & I were seated immediately. It was the first time for both of us, so the waiter explained how the ordering process goes, which is simply just putting a check mark next to the items you want. Lobster house also offers alcoholic beverages.My friend I decided on a variety of different flavored shrimp, mussels, crawfish, salmon, crab legs, ribs, calamari, broccoli & seafood lo main. Everything was good , hot, & seasoned well. For drinks we tried the ""Lychee Passion"" which was eh it's not something I would order again. For pricing, I think it's very moderately priced for what you get which is $40 per person for the unlimited seafood. The way they have the food portioned is good & the only thing we ordered a 2nd serving of was the crab legs, while still having plenty of other food still left. I do feel the drinks are few dollars overpriced. I would think it would be between $10-$12, but it's gonna cost you $15 with limited options. Our server was very polite & attentive. We never had to look around for our sever because he checked in. So, why the three stars might you ask...it's due to the ""service charge"". They specify on the menu the ""service charge"" is for the ""business"" & not gratuity. I have a really hard time believing that & when my bill is going to the business...now if the business is also taking that ""service charge"", that's just greedy & unethical in my opinion. My next question would be how are you coming up with that % because it's 12% they are charging as a ""service charge"". At the end of the night the waiter also reiterated to us how the ""service charge"" works & a tip isn't mandatory, but would be appreciated. We did tip him, but I just don't know about this ""service charge"" thing not going to the waiter, who I feel should be entitled to it. Just because you change something to ""service charge"" & not use the word ""gratuity"" that doesn't mean that's not what it is.",The food was ok nothing amazing. Honestly the wait time was insane got there at 7 wasn't seated until 9. I did not like how they used the same sauce for majority of the food. The only good thing was the crab legs because that just had butter.,DO NOT GO HERE!!!! RIP OFF!!! Husband and I decided to go here for our anniversary. First off the food was mediocre.  Don't be fooled by the all you can eat. Everybody in your party have to order the all you can eat or it's invalid. Why is this disclaimer not on the menu?? How you gonna force people to pay for food they don't want??! So fine cause the hubby eats a lot I agreed. So we had to ASK for bibs and crackers for our crabs. We had to ASK for butter which was just that... melted butter.. no seasoning.. bland. Server was nice but he had no idea of the policies. So we're ready to go so we ask for to go containers. WAIT!!!! you are charging us $20 PER PERSON to take the food we already paid for to go??! Once again no disclaimer!!! We should've went to Red Lobster. They pissed me off.P.S. This was the Queens Blvd location,"All I can say is ask for Fred, hes wonderful and funny. This was our first visit and he explained everything.The food is very good and it came out quick. The potions are plentiful. We were seated within 5 mins. On a Saturday evening.We will be back","Visited the Lobster House for the first time yesterday 9/1/19. Waited about 25 mins for a table and when we got the text our table was ready we had to wait another 10 to 15 mins. That was the only con to our experience there. The food was impressively good. Everything we ordered was very well seasoned. Jumbo shrimp in garlic and butter sauce was phenomenal. They don't lie when they jumbo shrimp either. The crab legs were all good. My daughter loved the ribs it was more the sauce for em that made the ribs good. My hubby really liked the fried scallops and he enjoyed the crab legs as well. I was very pleased with the food. The service was pleasant too. Our waitress, Kimberly, was super nice, patient, and gave us great suggestions as to what she thought we would like and she was spot on. Thank you Kimberly for suggesting the whole bass in chili sauce and the salmon! They were both great! We didn't feel rushed to eat or order. Each order was made fresh and everything is made to order. The food and service here is definitely worth the money!!! This will definitely be the spot!","Pretty good place. Delicious food, great service and reasonable prices. The only problem is, as time passes, it gets worse. They used to let you order lobster, and that was included in the price. Now they got ""smart"" and quietly changed their rules. Now you have to pay $25 EXTRA if you want lobster.You know what you came here for. So don't be stupid, and don't stuff yourself with bread, noodles or rice. Eat only shrimp, crab, scallop and other seafood. Make sure you have space in your stomach for it. The more carbs you eat, the happier the place will be cause you cost them less money!",Lobster House All You Can Eat Seafood
30,"Bad management is the only reason why there's a crazy wait time at this iconic venue! We were seated and waited over 40 minutes for our check to close out. Please train your staff and hire better managers to run your franchise more efficiently! The more wait time you impose on customers, the more money you lose. The food is terrific as always but NOT worth the 90-120 minutes wait.Also, get to ready to be attacked by flies because the venue is infested with them!",Bronzini Fish is too healthy and too good to say no too! Flavor is not as strong as salmon. Desser,"One of the better Greek places in Astoria. While salad was big, it lacked dressing throughout the salad (sat in the bottom of the plate and we felt we were eating just vegs without any seasoning). We very much liked the cheese and everything else we got. They have outside seating but might have long lines depending on time/day.","This is just a fantastic restaurant that delivers an A+ experience. It was a beautiful Oct 1, ""Indian summer"" evening. Yes it helped that we got a parking spot right across the street from the restaurant. Yes it helped that there was no wait and we got a perfect outdoor table.The food was incredible. All of it. The pita bread, the Greek salad, and spinach pie. The steak, the swordfish, the lemon potatoes, the beets. Delicious.Now the service. Everyone is attentive and caring.  The waiters, the busboys, and even the hostess attended to our needs. They were also helpful and accommodating to food allergies in our family.All in all, this is dining out at its finest. Can't wait to go back again.",Delicious greek food in Astoria. Plenty of outdoor seating and some indoors. Grilled octopus was delicious! Chewy and flavorful. Calamari tasted freshly battered and fried. The fish is very tender and all the portions are big enough to split. Chicken kebabs were huge and not dry. The entrees also comes with sides. We also ordered a greek salad to lift up the the heaviness of the meats. They also provide a complimentary dessert afterwards - a greek custard with cinnamon. Overall great place to go when you want fresh greek seafood and to treat yourself.,"Five of us ate here last night and were very lucky to have had the right number of people for the one open table out on the patio on a beautiful fall night. This popular restaurant gets very crowded quickly but everyone we met was friendly and welcoming. Also they are very efficient directing patrons to tables. We began our meal with some very tasty crispy eggplant & zucchini chips with a garlic dip and their complimentary loaf of bread - well two actually, a humongous Greek salad and a bottle of their house white wine. For the main courses I had not one but two cooked perfectly Greek hamburgers (my wish come true - a place that gives you two patties, not just one :-). The others in my family had (per their feedback) delicious lamb chops, Branzini (Mediterranean sea bass) and Barbounia (red mullets). For dessert they give you a complementary custard pastry that was the perfect ending! The minor glitches that kept this review from being 5-stars were the vegetables that they serve with the entree - chard that was bitter and that none of us liked at all and that we had to ask three times to get a second plastic bag in which to bring home our leftovers. So overall, I am a fan!",Taverna Kyclades
31,Tried JoJu and their bread was disappointing. It seemed like they used an Italian hero bread (taste and texture wise) and made Viet sandwich with it. I tried it twice thinking it might be off just that day but it was the same. Will not be coming back.,"Joju was my favorite banh mi place but not anymore because today I found a hair in my food. I immediately stopped eating, showed it to employees there but they didnt give me my refund so I just asked for a milkshake and went home. I swear I'll never return","The girl on the phone who took our order literally told us the order of chicken comes with 4 pieces when we asked and we asked for one order with green sauce. We ended up with a double order of the over dried nasty looking fried chicken and NO GREEN SAUCE even though it was in the order. We called and told them and the same girl on the phone only offered ""sorry"". You have ruined our dinner that we were looking forward to and travelled 50 minutes for","JoJu is a NY favorite of ours. We went twice in one weekend and ordered the same thing both times. HIGHLY recommend the bulgogi banh mi with the green spice bomb (it's a spicy cilantro cream based sauce with great flavor and not super spicy). The meat is packed with flavor has the perfect balance of sweet and savory with the pickled vegetables adding a great crunch. Love the surprises of jalapeño in the sandwich- next time will ask for more. The bread is great- perfectly crunchy without being stale or too difficult to chew. We also got the kimchi fries with beef bulgogi. The fries itself were great. I THINK the only thing they really add is kimchi, green onions, and spicy mayo. I do wish there was shredded cheese, jalapeños,.. it just needs a tad more. We are from Texas and love our Chilantro's kimchi fries and these weren't to that level. We poured on some spicy green sauce on top too! We also got a taro milk tea with boba- delicious but just a TAD sweet. Not sure they let you control the sweetness level though. I am being picky here- still giving 5 stars and will def be back!!","This is actually pretty good. Portions are good, with really delicious options here. To be very honest, I am not a Super big fan of any food related to sandwiches or bread (or salad for that matter) but JoJu managed to sway my opinion. Good stuff. The pork belly is my favourite, as per the fries.","From the busy tables and long line when I first came in, I knew that JoJu was gonna be good. I ordered the JoJu bowl (BBQ pork and caramelized pork) with cabbage salad, added spring rolls, and green sauce. The bowl was bigger than I expected and it definitely made me rlly full. I thought the BBQ pork was a little too dry for me but the caramelized pork tasted as good as it looked - savory and a little bit of sweetness combined. Spring rolls were a nice addition and the green sauce gave a little kick to the bowl. However, I do recommend getting it with rice instead of cabbage salad since I started to lose taste of the meat after a while because there was a lot of sliced cabbage as the base. My less sweetened Thai iced tea was honestly the perfect amount of sweetness so that was rlly satisfying.Our order was to go so I didn't get to try the banh mi fries at its finest first seconds of crispiness but the radishes on top mix well, giving the fries a light and crunchy accompaniment.",JoJu
32,"This is NOT a Brazilian churrasqueria. The quality of the meat was very disappointed. Salty and cheap cuts. We asked for costilla and they're gave us a boiled nasty cut of something that we couldn't eat, just 3 pieces of garbage. The buffet was a joke. Remind me of something along like cheap buffet like cafeteria. Cheap and unfresh salad.  Hot dishes were not appetizing at all. Cheese bread was a joke ( only if you request) I'm so regret that we went there for my mom birthday.  We won't ever be going back again and I dont recomend this place. The service was ok. We paid $ 300 for 6 peoples just for the grilled pineapple.  To the owner!!!don't be cheap with the meat. If not you should open a sandwich store.","The meat selection here is pretty limited and falls subpar to my experience elsewhere. My favorite thing here is the pineapple, but that's really it. I don't feel like the food comes around often enough.","Very disappointed. Never going back. Place was recommended as was told it's great. Decided to check it out. Had a horrible experience in 2017. Decided to give it another try. Not surprising- had another bad experience. First of all- they accuse u of sharing food. Maybe some customers do that. But do not go around accusing ppl just because that's what u want to do. Secondaly, they charge for everyone on the table. Even if it's a 3 month old baby- like seriously!!! Because the baby ate the food , inhaled the air or occupied space -1 seat-  in ur massive area??Food maybe great. But customer service is horrible. Takes away from ur appetite.2 tries is more than enough. Left the place with a bad taste in my mouth. Adios peeps. Never again.","On Saturday Aug.10th around 5pm. Went to celebrate a birthday, my first time there. It was so nice & the meats cut tableside were AMAZING & DELICIOUS! The pineapple was sooo delicious. And what an assortment of food to choose from. Everything was delicious. We recommend not loading up at the buffet so much & so you can enjoy the delicious grilled meats. I ate so much that I didn't try any sweets from the dessert bar! The cakes looked so good!!The staff was really nice I enjoyed Johnny so friendly & nice and especially our waitress Karla who was so sweet & had an infectious smile & laughter. She was so nice really professional. You must try the margaritas SO GOOD!A really nice place! Donna","To preface this review, I was here ages ago (20+ yrs) back when it was called Greenfield's.  It is nice to see that it still exists and that it's so beautifully decorated.  While there are plenty of proteins served, I do miss the rabbit and the many variations of beef options they used to have.  It seems times have changed the menu quite a bit.  Gone are the wooden cues - red for stop, green for more food.  They have been replaced by square shaped business cards (red on one side, green on the other) to signal the staff that you want more grub.I was here on Monday, Memorial day for an early dinner, group of 15 (adults and kids alike).  Confusing start as some items were included in the one price point vs the other (they differentiate between the salad bar vs the all you can eat) and there is no dessert or drinks included in the price per person.  Those are all a la carte.  A full beverage and cocktail menu is available - ranging from soda, juice, Brazilian soda, Mexican Coke, ie.Adding to the confusion were the kids' pricing - ages 4-10 were one price, regardless the rotation of meat or not.  Then any child 11+ had the option of the salad bar only or the all you can eat meat as well.  Price difference obviously stated, was approx $10 more for the AYCE meat.Our waitress was very friendly and helpful in getting us all that we asked for.  We noticed the servers were not coming over to us as much as we'd like...partly due to where we sat. If you can, request for a table near the salad bar or in the main dining area.  We sat just outside of that, by the windows and the cocktail Bar.  This is also where the TVs are at.  While dining, I saw most of the servers with their meat skewers on display walking around the main dining area first so by the time it made it over to us, there was a lot of meat gone.We also noticed the variety of meat that was being paraded around was the basically chicken, sirloin, or pork ribs.  So, we took note with the waitress and started ordering on demand - which worked out way better.  Duck was not available (we asked), though it is advertised. We ended up requesting quail, Lamb, and cheese bread. Not quite the fresh pan Con queso but it'll do. Bite sized cheese bread is always a win.The bacon wrapped anything was delicious. The quail was really good too but a bit on the small side. Best thing actually was the grilled pineapple and the medium rare steak. My group and I had a fun evening nonetheless once we go to dessert. They had chocolate cake, tiramisu, passion fruit mousse, cheesecake and red velvet cake. There may have been one or two more but I can't seem to recall now.BTW, the salad bar does have meat entrees in it so if you're not a big eater, it could be a good option. Pasta with meatballs was available, fries, chicken nuggets, fish, lots of different salads, and a yummy beef stew type option with potatoes. But alas, I came for the all you can eat meat so I only made one pass at the salad bar. It was just to get my veggies in. LOL So this review was just three stars as some of the meat was only ok. I expected more variety and I didn't like that it was all you can eat only on the meat. For the premium price, it should've included a soft drink or one dessert option. They should just create that option.","Absolutely incredible experience! Food was amazing and the service...... other restaurants need to learn from them.  Our hostess was super sweet and our server Johnny was absolutely phenomenal, I have never had a more welcoming and helpful server in my entire life, friendly, talkative and attentive to everything.  This place is our new go to...",Rainhas Churrascaria
33,I finally understood why people come from far away to eat their food. It's really good.,"Very salty lolya kebab, overly done however, tasty buckwheat side. Service is good but so disappointed that recipe changed and now it tastes not how it used to. Meat mix looked dense and very bland.",Very good food with a unique Georgian menuGenerous portions.   Busy and noisy but worth it,It was REALLY good! The service is A+ and the atmosphere is clean and beautiful. The lamb fell off the bone! We didn't have a reservation but they squeezed us in.,Best kosher restaurant in NY.Very well organized and great chill atmosphere.The food is soooooo good. No words.Had many events at this place and the owner always takes care of us. Always a pleasure to enjoy good old kosher Georgian food.,"Came here on a busy busy Tuesday night with some friends to sample everything we could.For starters we had the bean, spinach and eggplant dip with fresh baked Georgian bread. Next was the adjaruli (bread bowl with mushroom beef and sunny side up egg). I really wanted the addition of cheese but being all kosher, you can only order the cheese bread to go which I highly recommend. Cheese and bread were made to be together so you have to try this Georgian classic. For entrees, we had theChicken tabaka - flavorful but didn't wow me, the fries were good.Chanahi - this was some good braised beef, goes great with the buckwheat.Lamb / chicken breast / chicken thigh kebabs - all the kebabs were delicious, large portions of tender juicy flavorful perfectly roasted meat.Overall we all enjoyed the meal, I can definitely see myself ordering takeout in the very near future.",Marani
34,"Came here for a birthday and we're weren't really happy with the service. Since it was a surprise party we asked to be seated first (Party of 9 - only waiting for 2 which was the birthday boy to arrive), the host or owner wasn't very friendly and didn't seat us until we made a big deal about it. From there the only thing the redeemed the place was our friendly waiter. Food was ok. Canadian Bacon was really good.",The parking is terrible in that area it took me 15 minutes to find parking. It's a small restaurant. I had reservations for 10:15PM and was seated 20 minutes later. The appetizers and the main course was rather bland. If you need flavor walk with your seasoning. The drinks were average. I will never visit this location again.,"In my opinion, your experience here can vary between 2 to 4 stars here. My experience was not great. The following are pros and cons of my experience:Pros:1. Restaurant interior and exterior decor is nice and clean2. Most of the staff have good energy3. They remembered it was my mother's birthday. A slice of chocolate cake with a song at the end of the dinner.Cons:1. Mosquitos in outdoor seating - my party of 4 was getting bit up by mosquitos. The restaurant did not have any mosquito repellant such as candles or torches despite being aware of the situation. They just stated that we're near a park so it is what it is. This is a big oversight and likely why the outdoor seating area was empty.2. Amateur service - the overall staff was a mix bunch. Generally nice but forgetful and unaware of their surroundings. A) The check still billed for a wrong order despite the person saying they'll remove it. Also, we had to ask for the check 3 times over the span of 20 minutes before finally getting it.B) A waitor and waitress brushed up on my back 7 times without apology despite there being about 3 feet of space between myself and the next table. I was already sitting very close to the edge of my table.C) There were 2 tables with loud toddlers screaming on and off for an hour until they tired out. The staff did nothing to say something to the parties to quiet their kids down. Needless to say, this was a major annoyance.3. Food is okay, but not great - I had higher expectations of this place given the overall positive reviews. The food was not anything memorable. The medium rare porterhouse steak at this steakhouse was not tender, just mushy and mostly flavorless. If you've had Peter Luger or similar, this place will disappoint. A seasoned home cooked steak will taste better honestly.","What a wonderful experience ...Prime, Bone in prime Sirloin - Prime On the Bone Rib Eye..  truffle oil Mac and cheese.  Mashed potatoes my mother would have been proud of.  A buffalo mozzarella salad ... So very happy to have found Meet the Meat!  An honor to have a sitting and enjoy!","First time here... loved how close to the house it was.. I didn't really enjoy my steak .. I ordered a ribeye on the bone.. medium rare.. somehow the outside was very well done and dry (crust like I assume they were trying ) which was already a turn off but I really wanted to give it a chance. The inside of steam was good but the outside didn't let me taste the flavor or freshness of the steak. The other steak we ordered was fine (filet mignon)The mixed drinks were awesome , bar tender definitely made up for everything ,.. will give it another chance in the future but not rushing ..","A.GREAT.TIME!!!!!! We Met the Meat and we were pleased!!! Thank goodness for Yelp and good vs. bad reviews! Go for your own experience! I got a call from family in Canada who was coming into town for a birthday and their anniversary celebration. He wanted to celebrate and needed help in rounding up folks to attend and share in the festivities, as well as help finding a location. I took to Yelp and landed on MTM. I tried to make a reservation on Open Table for the at first 20 persons. But because of the number of attendees I had to call directly to the restaurant. Enter Adnan, the owner/chef who advised the process for reservation and we booked. Sunday rolled around and we dwindled down to 13 but it was a lucky 13! Unfortunately, we didn't all make the reservation on time due to happenstance. But  MTM staff was still responsive and greeted us upon entering. They were cordial and responsive to our even smallest requests throughout the evening. The location is in a quiet neighborhood across from Ricardo's. It's family owned and operated which I think lent to the overall feeling of a great time. The bar pours?!? WHEW!!! Yes and yes!! My honey doesn't tend to like a lot of ice in his Jack because it gets watered down. There was a lot of ice in his glass. But it didn't deter from the actual pour to his pleasant surprise! I had the Moscow Mule...the pour was so good I didn't need a 2nd since I was driving. Others had martinis and they loved those as well. On to the food...apps included broiled shrimp, crab cakes and scallops. For me, the shrimp were too little, although they were full of flavor. The crab cakes were flat which concerned me. However, it's actual crab meat and flavor was on POINT! We ended up getting about 4 orders of it because it was so good. I didn't have the scallops but our table partners did and they loved them. Entrees included prime rib, filet mignon, salmon, lamb chops, chicken parm, and sliced steak. Let's just say the only complaint was because the initial bite of the prime rib wasn't medium well. Side dishes were asparagus, mashed potatoes, onion rings, cream spinach. Seasoning was not limited to salt & pepper...THANK YOU ADNAN! Everything we ate was delicious! We finished the night with dessert for the birthday boy and anniversary couple!! The tiramisu was also delicious and the tartufo, which was new to us all, was DELISH!!! Adnan came out at the end and greeted us. He was complimented on the quality of the food which he stated was ""made with love"". We could tell and we appreciated it because it was a night to celebrate love! We toasted with MTM Martini shots which was just the perfect topper! Many thanks to Adnan and family for your hospitality. We plan to make this event an annual one and hope to be back again. Even without our Canadian fam, my honey and I will DEFINITELY be back!!!",Meet The Meat
35,"First off we are the first and only customers in the early morning to this restaurant so I am like ok this will be a great first time experience when this place is literally empty. Service- Horrible no energy no drive kinda as if he didn't want to work or serve us either way. Didn't ask how was food or any follow ups on our meal remember we are the only ones in the restaurant.Food- was ok ordered Chicken and Waffles with home fries. Home fries were warm to cool but how remember we are the only ones maybe with one other group so I expect the home fries to be smoking ( not even close) Overall for my first experience I wasn't impressed at all I came here because of the reviews but was disappointed even when there was less than 3 parties in the restaurant at the time.  This was a 58 dollar meal and food should have been better, didn't meet the hype.","Standard American brunch place. By looking at the menu, one brunch entree is usually over $23. It comes with free coffee/tea/juice and is serves in a relatively large portion. The taste was fine but didn't stand out in any way. In addition, the tables were arranged very close to each other; hard to not overhear the next table and hard for waitresses to come over to our table.","This place had a lot of good reviews, but I was very disappointed. My avocado toast had a mixture of flavors that I found to be odd. Let's start with the bread itself: the slice of toast itself was the same bread that came on the side of my bfs meal. A thin, regular old slide of bread. Now that's just lame for 14 some $. Moving along, the avocado was okay, but it was slathered in a thousand island like dressing and sundried tomatoes. It was just a really odd combination. I was not a fan and would argue that it was the worst avocado toast I've ever had. My Bf had the steak and eggs and found the steak dry.","One of my favorite places. The food and drinks are great. The decor is awesome, and the staff are lovely. The only reason I took away a star is because it is small. There are certain seats that are not comfortable to sit if you are a bit hearty. Other than that it's still an awesome place. They are also open to accommodating you if you are uncomfortable.Check them out !","The food was good if not a bit on the bland side. For a place that charges $19 for avocado toast, it wasn't as mind blowing as everyone says it is. My friends and I came on a fairly hot and crowded day and asked to be seated inside, surprised to find there was no AC. It was so hot and stuffy you were literally breathing in used air. We ordered food and i personally didn't care for the chicken and waffles or the avocado toast but the Mac and cheese was excellent so i definitely recommend that. I ordered a sprite which was flat and my friend got drinks which ended up being so much more expensive then any other place we've been to and a lot weaker than what we were expecting (considering it was a mimosa that's saying something). Maybe because it was disgustingly hot that i couldn't breath or the fact that the food was a bit sub par, or maybe it was the flies floating around the restaurant but i definitely do not recommend this place. I give them one star for having great Mac and cheese but that's all i can spare. Save your money go elsewhere.","Service was okay not good. Coffee was horrible and  food was all cold. Super disappointed.I got a $17 Avocado toast that was a joke. It came with toast from a bag that they serve as a side to other meals. It barley had avocado on top. It seems like they ran out.  They could have told me, I would have ordered something else.",The Shady Lady
36,"Good, simple Indian food. I like that everything was flavorful but not too heavy or greasy. I was only disappointed that the paratha they brought us was just naan basically. We got the tikka masala, sag paneer, samosas, and i think the Chana masala. All were good but nothing was super memorable.","Ordered delivery though Yelp on a Monday night and they delivered slightly earlier than their 45-55 min estimated window.Overall, they got the order correct and there wasn't anything terrible about the food. It just fell short of expectations taste- and texture-wise on dishes I've eaten many times from other restaurants.Garlic naan - BCheese naan - BChicken tikka masala - A-Lamb saag - B-Aloo gobi matar - B+Each entree came with a rice. With four people we finished both naans, three entrees, and 2.5 rices.",My first time there to eat their buffet and I have to say that their dishes are quite good. It's a very small place but the staffs are attentive and always refilling water and replenishing the dishes.,"One of the best Indian restaurants I have ever been to!Personal favorites: coconut naan, tikka masala, samosas, and aloo gobi.They also offer an amazing dinner pre fixe for about 17 dollars. You will definitely be full and maybe even have some leftovers","Favorite Indian restaurant in all of Astoria hands down! Sometimes it gets so packed I even call to make a reservation because the place is so small and honestly you never know. On the same avenue there's about 3 other Indian restaurants but they just aren't up to par as this one in my opinion.The classics: chicken tikka masala, of course is always on point but recently I cus fed my order to their shrimp tikka masala and I enjoy it wayyyy better. My boyfriend loves the chicken korma which is always nice and creamy. He can always finish his but we e d up taking mine to go, then he finishes it for me. We've done their prefix meal and ala cart ordering. Both are good depending on how much you want to eat. I like the garlic naan and he likes the cheese naan so up to you! They also have classic desserts such as kheer,rasmalai, and gulab jamun. I've always loved rasmali though so I'm kind of biased. I recommended making a reservation JUST INCASE or walk in, but larger parties definitely should make a reservation. This place is very needed in Astoria and I hope it stays for years to come. Excellent quality of food, but there's always room for improvement.","Very friendly servers, delicious food in healthy portions. Definitely best Indian spot in Astoria. The place itself is a bit small, so you might have to anticipate a wait if you plan on dining in.",Seva Indian Cuisine
37,This place was difficult to find as it is located inside a maze of couple other stores. I went in with high expectations from this place upon recommendation. However my experience here was not upto the par. The wait time was amost 30 mins for a bowl of soup momo. The seating area is mediocre and the food was so-so. Disappointed!,Called to order takeout. Had the hardest time finding this place and calling the store was zero help. We get in line to pick up our takeout order and ended up waiting 45 minutes after we arrived. The tables were so dirty and the place had this weird rotten smell that made my husband nauseated. I don't know if the meat went bad or what but these did not taste or smell like the momo's I had that their other location.,"They have the best momo's in queens no questions asked. Order the Beef chive momos!The laphing is bomb too, dry or wet. I crave it regularly. Don't order laphing if you can't handle the heat though.The service here is extremely slow because they cook the momo's TO ORDER. Expect to wait 20 min or more for momo's. Worth it","I LOVE the food here. I've been here more than a handful of times and as I'm writing this review, I've realized I haven't been back in a while .. I am due for another trip to Lhasa Fast Food. I absolutely love the beef and chive momos with the orange spicy sauce that you can find on the table. The momos are super juicy and flavorful. It usually takes a while for the momos to come out cause it always appears that they are making momos fresh to keep up with all the orders! It's sooo worth the wait (not long though). I love to get the sushi liang fen but be warned - it is VERY Spicy. They mean it when they say spicy. I've also had the beef with glass noodles - the broth is very spicy as well. The thenthuk, Tibetan noodle, and chow mein are great. The noodle soups always hit the spot! The soup is very flavorful. The butter tea is good - it's a little salty from the butter.The place is located at the back of the building, behind a cell phone store so it's pretty warm during the winter time but It doesn't bother me, I go for the food! Sometimes there's a wait for a table since the space is small but I never have to wait too long.I highly recommend this place.","Eating Tibetan food in the back of a cell phone store should be on everyone's bucket list.This place only has a few tables, so if you see an opening, snag it (there's table service anyway). You may have to share one of the bigger tables and do it communal style, but it's worth it.We were lucky enough to snag a two-top, right next to a photo of the late, great Anthony Bourdain when he visited in 2006.We started out with the chili fried beef. It was SPICY. Well, not overwhelmingly so, but it had some heat. The beef was a little on the tougher side, but there was a ton of it along with mixed peppers.Next up, we got an order of the chicken momos. They were steaming hot. Eight to an order and delicious!They also have a larger location in Elmhurst that we passed by. That one has way more seating and has a more extensive menu, so if it's too busy here, try your luck there!","My fiancé and I trekked up to Jackson Heights to try out this gem. I saw a lot of pictures of this place on Instagram, and was on the lookout of the phone store. We got there around 12:30, and was able to grab a table. We decided to order the beef and chive momos and the sushi leng feng. The leng feng was super spicy, I was glad that my fiancé could finish it, but I wouldn't recommend it if you can't handle spicy food. The beef and chive momos were tasty, but there was definitely more chives than beef in the momos. I'm glad that we got there at 12:30 because when it got to 1pm a line started to build up, also they do accept credit card but would recommend bringing cash for tip.",Lhasa Fast Food
38,"Can't believe I've missed out on this place for so long. There's nothing better than picking your own seafood to be cooked your way and delivered to your table. Head to the back and bag your variety of seafood: lots of fish variety, clams, squid, crab, scallops, octopus, shrimp. Then when you pay you can choose how they cook your order: basically fried or grilled. Pick your sides of Greek salad, garlic bread, lemon potatoes, etc, to finish the ordering.Highly recommend the grilled scallops and fried calamari; I could eat those everyday. The grilled seasoning and predominant olive oil they use to cook things is basic, but absolutely delicious.We showed up at opening lunch on a weekday with no table wait. Peak times (weekend dinner) I've heard are the worst so avoid if you are starving and don't want to wait. You're not coming to this place for ambiance, its plastic utensils, or rowdiness at times (seem some videos from friends); just get your seafood and chow down.","It's always a little bit chaotic here, but the past few visits, it's been downright awful; I mean disastrous; I can deal with chaos & gridlock, but this is insanity. Sadly, from employees much more than customers.","Excited for the entire experience prior to getting seated, but left this market extremely underwhelmed and did not live to the hype or expectations. Came here on a Thurs night around 7pm. There was a small crowd outside but we were told it was not considered busy, and our wait would be about 30 mins for a party of 2. We felt lucky as other reviews mentioned that the wait on a busy night could exceed 2hrs. When we were finally seated, the female server wiped down the table except the left over food particles landed all over the seats. Ok whatever, grabbed some tissue and wiped down the chairs. This way I don't stand up later on with a piece of octopus stuck to my behind. Looked down at our plates and there's olive oil on the edges. No big deal, I switched the plates out for a clean set. My plastic fork had some dirty specks, and the female server sees me wiping it down. She gives me a dirty stare as if I had offended her and snatches the fork out of my hand, and switches it out for a new one. No smile, no apologies, just a pissed off look. While I couldn't tell whether she was jokingly upset or really upset, I was already having a not so pleasant experience. Food-Grilled red snapper was the best item amongst all our dishes. Calamari was fried so can't really go wrong. Had to ask for lemons and sauce (tarter only). Clams were grilled which was probably not the right cooking method. It had an over grilled burnt smell and the clams were very chewy. Some of our shells didn't even open up fully. We gave up after eating 2 clams b/c the plastic fork experience was not doing it. Grilled scallops was nothing special. Grilled jumbo shrimp was tough which was a waste b/c they're $22.50/lb. Grilled octopus came out cold. We ordered a lot for 2 ppl. We were sharing a table with 2 other ppl so table space was limited. We had empty plates and instead of clearing it off the table, our server just piled the other dishes on top of it like it was a game of jenga. I don't know if she just didn't like us after I wiped down my fork or she was overwhelmed from the chaos, but we asked another server to help clear the dishes. While I understand that this is a no frills/ market type of experience and I was not expecting any fine dining treatment, but the terrible service exceeded my expectations for mediocre food. If the place wasn't as chaotic, perhaps the cooks would've been able to add a pinch more garlic and salt to our dishes. If I were to ever come back, it would only be during lunch hours on a weekday where most ppl are at work and I so happen to be in the area. For the time being, I have no intention of coming back.",Had 1 of the best seafood experiences in NY ever... I picked fresh what I wanted and Had them cook it  #Grilled #Snapper #Prawn #octopus ...A+ Dont let the decor of the location  fool  you its simple prepared food cooked with  Mediterranean flavors#foodieadventure #Foodie #foodporn  #seafood,"Astoria Seafood is a unique dining experience.  You wait on line to pick your seafood from a reasonably fresh selection of seafood, including a wide variety of fishes, squid, octopus, clams, shrimp, lobster and other shellfish.  You then wait on line to pay for the seafood & request the way you want your seafood cooked (boiled, grilled, etc.) &  then wait on another line to wait for a table.  Once you are seated, you need to wait for your food to be ready.  The seafood is definitely fresh and they definitely know how to cook it well.  The food itself is worth 4 stars but the overall is experience is a mediocre 3 star experience (I would actually give 2.5 star if I could) and I would not go back.First, as you can see from my description of how you get your food, you will be waiting...a lot...on multiple lines...  It took me about an hour and a half from the moment I arrived until my food was served.Second, many tables were missing basic condiments and people in different tables had to share them or they were just out of luck and couldn't get them at all:  hot sauce, salt, pepper, butter, etc.Third, wait staff was clearly stretched thin and none of them was willing to help people on tables they were not covering.  Multiple times, we try to get help from a waiter or waitress who was not our own (when she was being overwhelmed by other tables she was covering) and each of them pointed to our waitress and told me we needed to talk to her.Fourth, and this was the most unforgivable oversight, there was a single working seafood shell cracker for the entire restaurant.  This meant that, when we received our barely cracked lobsters claws, we had to wait for several minutes for our waitress to locate and bring the cracker to us.  This meant that the lobster got lukewarm and borderline cold during this wait.Overall, this place is worthwhile to try once but it's not a repeater.","The pros: Affordable, casual & unpretentious, delicious and fresh seafood made to order, you pick what you want to eatThe cons: Long wait time, loud, no frillsWhen DH and I first walked into the restaurant, we had no idea what was going on.  A small crowd of people were waiting in the front and we didn't know that they had already picked their seafood, stood in line to hand over their pickings and place their orders on how they'd like said seafood prepared (fried, sauteed in butter, steamed?)  We thought they were waiting for a table where you first sit and then order.  We wasted quite a bit of time figuring out what we should do but after browsing the selection at the back, we finally settled on a small white fish (no idea which one), calamari, shrimp, Greek salad and seafood rice.  We then waited for an hour for our food to be cooked and for us to be seated.  This was a weekday around 7pm so we didn't start eating until 8.  In the hour we had to kill, we walked to a liquor store and back to buy a bottle of sake since it's BYOB (no corkage fee) and then stood outside chatting and checking in every 5-10 minutes or so because we were hungry and the food looked and smelled divine at this point.  Finally we were seated and the food did not disappoint!  We loved everything and wow, it was a lot of food.  DH had wanted to order more and I'm glad I stopped him.  TBH, the Greek salad was my favorite part of the meal as my diet is primarily plant based.  I did really enjoy the shrimp though and the complimentary bread was perfect for dipping in the buttery garlic sauce that they sauteed it in.  Delicious!  Only complaints I had:Although we ordered the seafood rice (it was available at the time we ordered), it never came out and when we asked about it, we were told there wasn't anymore.  They refunded us so no big deal.  And although we ordered and paid for a water and soda, we had to remind them to bring it to us.  So just keep track of what you ordered as they don't seem to. Overall, we really enjoyed our dinner at Astoria Seafood and would definitely come back.  It isn't going to be the best dining experience you've ever had but if you have time to kill with someone you don't mind spending hours with, it will be worth the wait.  This is THE restaurant to come to if you want a casual, affordable seafood meal.  Be forewarned, manage your expectations.",Astoria Seafood
39,Favorite Thai Place so far. Made my way through all their Currys; Shrimp Avacado curry is my #1 choice but the Massaman and the Red are close seconds.Service is always fast and wait staff always kin'd.,"I came here about 2.5 months ago and now I'm back for a couple of weeks. In the previous review I had given them only 2 stars because they were suggesting the tips based on AFTER TAX calculations, which is both unethical and illegal. This time however, I'm happy to report that they corrected that and now suggest the tip based on the sub-total. The only thing I did not like was that when I spoke to the owner, she said ""Oh, but everyone does it like that"". Does that mean that because others break the law that she can too?Anyway, I like the quality of the food, service and ambiance. It deserves a 3.5 star rating, so I'll round UP rather than down because they corrected that practice. (Even though they were pressured to)I still think they should serve at least 5 dumplings rather than 4 for the $6 price as most other Thai restaurants do, but that's their prerogative.Howard S.","Ok, the dishes are tasty. The location is fine with easy street parking across the street.There are two issues however.First, the serious issue is that when they give you the check, they suggest what a 15%, 18% or 20% tip would be. Normally that would be fine. The problem is that they are calculating those ""suggested tips"" based on the total meal AFTER taxes! That is not only incorrect to do that but illegal. Imagine each couple paying a dollar or more extra because of that. It should be based on the sub-total before the tax!What's worse is that I brought that same issue up with them a few months back. They said they'd correct it. Obviously they give service with a smile while stabbing you in the back and cheating you just a little!That's the worst kind of merchant.If I see it a third time, I will report them and their practices to the sales & use tax division of the Department of Finance.The other thing was their veggie dumplings. Almost all Thai restaurants give you 6 pieces. Here, just 4 pieces and tiny bite-sized at that!Again, it just shows a cheapness that will eventually come back to ""bite"" them.Howard S.","I love me a good Thai lunch special, and Kin'd delivered just that. The restaurant is spacious and modern on the inside. Great spot to dine with a group or for a date. To eat I had the crispy tofu app with side salad, followed by the Spicy Basil sauteed with chicken. The tofu was nicely fried, and the peanut dressing on the salad was delish but maybe a bit too much dressing for my taste. The spicy basil entree was a good portion size for lunch. It is served with jasmine rice; mine was a bit stale but soaked up the sauce well and helped balance the salt of the dish. Pretty salty affair, but very tasty. My date had the Bangkok wings which reminded me of chicken nuggets (in a good way), followed by the Drunken noodles with chicken. The drunken noodles were the highlight of the meal, but only had 2 pieces of chicken in it. Still, tasted soooooo good. Both dishes were marked as 'spicy' on the menu, but we both could have used a bit more spice. I will be back for my own order of drunken noods and to try the lychee thai tea!!","March 2018-Went for dinner at this Thai restaurant with a family member and it didn't disappoint.  Excellent service, nice ambiance and reasonably priced delicious meal options.  Convenient street parking in the area.August-September 2019Delicious Thai cuisine.  Fresh, attentive service, clean establishment with a open vibe.  Highlight for our family-- coconut soup, calamari salad, app platter, fish, pineapple rice and shrimp dish","Went for dinner at this Thai restaurant with a family member and it didn't disappoint.  Excellent service, nice ambiance and reasonably priced delicious meal options.  Convenient street parking in the area.",Kin'd
40,"My thoughts as a chef of 10 years. And, as a neighborhood dad: 1. tone down the attitude at brunch when your restaurant has 4 tables seated. One table was a solo diner at that.2. as a server taking orders from a table, people may hesitate. The wrong thing to say to them is, ""Oh. So you're not ready.""3. if the food is running more than 20 minutes late, pop by the table and thank them for the patience. Maybe bring them more water. Especially if there's only 4 tables seated. 4. If there are children at the table, make sure their food didn't forget to be made. You're lucky my kid is pretty chill but it's annoying that all the adults have their food and we're waiting on pancakes. Especially when the table that came after us with a kid got their food before us. That is particularly bad form.5. Have syrup, not honey in a plastic bottle. It's a small detail that shows you're paying attention to things. 6. If you're charging $15 for a hamburger and you ask the customer how he wants it cooked, make an effort to cook it to the right temp. And don't serve day-old salad as a side that's clearly red and oxidized, limp and warm. That's just rude. 7. When the customer has politely informed you that the burger is cooked very well done, there is one right response: ""apologies, can I bring you something else?"" Not: * is this your first time here? Then you know our food is good* sometimes that happens* i insist on bringing you dessert8. when you bring dessert, and I ask you if there is booze or coffee in the dessert so I can share it with my child, there is ONE right response, either: * yes   or* no9. The WRONG response to a customer asking you if there is booze or coffee in the dessert, so I can share it with my child is NOT: * it has a little coffee, it's fine. She'll be fine. There's a saying we all know: good service can save bad food. Bad service kills the experience and word of mouth is still the most powerful recommendation.","I visited this restaurant yesterday. They managed to maintain polite customer service, quality food & drinks and competitive pricing but they set tables too close to one another which makes for an uncomfy meal. You can't have a proper conversation because people are sitting right next to you literally and that is not an exaggeration. That is a deal breaker for me. I totally understand maxmizing floor space but not at the risk of customer's comfort.Sorry guys!!","The place itself isn't that bad but food was terrible. First, my OJ was was just sitting at the bar for 5 minuets and asked my waiter where my juice was and he totally forgot about it. My poached egg came well-done (almost like a hard boiled egg) Salad was brown, potatoes tasted like pure vinegar. My husband's burger came cold. When we asked for ketchup the waitress gave me an empty bottle.... I don't think I wanna come back here again....","My dining companion and I were absolutely blown away by the quality of food and service that SoleLuna has to offered. As soon as we walked in the door, we were greeted by a friendly and enthusiastic owner. Being a first timer and a novice to authentic Italian cuisine, our waitress was very attentive and accommodating, answering any questions that we had.We started off our meal with a phenomenal bruschetta. The best I ever had. It was so well seasoned, topped with tomato that was so tasty that it just blown my mind. We then ordered a pasta with marinara sauce and the fish special, which was a generous serving of fillet of sole with an assortment of vegetables. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and needless to say, we send back nothing but clean plates. Also to note, the fact that the price of the specials were clearly listed on the menu demonstrates the kind of respect that the owner has for his diners. So hats off to you for that.We capped off our meal with an excellent homemade Napolean to share. I generally am not a fan of Napolean but the one we had tasted amazing. The flaky pastry paired so well with the rich but not too rich fresh cream. At the end of our dessert, we were served complimentary Limoncello which just made us feel even more welcome than we already did.Thank you again for a great meal and evening. I will certainly be back with friends and family.","Food here was just okay. The burrata was absolutely delicious, and I enjoyed the crusty bread and oil...but the pesto was underwhelming. Might have been better if I had ordered it with a protein because my gf had the marinara with meatballs, and the meatballs were delicious. So definitely get a meat with your pasta! The latte was very nice, although they do not offer syrups to flavor it with. Do not recommend the mocacino; plain latte was much nicer.","This is the best place!  First, I would like to say the thing that made is most memorable was the outdoor seating option.  That day, the weather was perfect and there was great breeze.  Second of all, our waitress was super friendly and warm.  I enjoyed the service and the kind staff.  It had such a great vibe!  Third of all, the ambience is welcoming and seems like an awesome place for dates, family gatherings, and friendly get-togethers.  Fourth of all, it's not hard to find especially if you are used to getting lost like me.  It's literally walking distance from the 40th st-Lowery St. train stop.I went recently to SoleLuna last Saturday evening with two dearest friends and had the most wonderful food adventure.  I very much enjoyed my meal.  Let's review what was ordered: started with appetizers of arancini of mushrooms, bruschetta al pomodoro, and fruitti di calamari.  The arancini (rice ball) was perfectly crispy and had a great yummy flavor.  The bruschetta had a freshly cut tomatoes that was simple yet savory.  And also their delicious bread was so satisfying with their olive oil.  Our entrees were the salmon spaghetti special, the yummy spaghetti with clams and heavenly ravioli.  I really enjoyed the spaghetti which was made just right.I was having so much fun here showing my friends from out of town Queens and what we have to offer.  If you ask me, I would definitely revisit.  I need to mention that they have wines, cocktails, and beer.  (I really loved my peach Mojito, in case you were wondering about my suggestion!)",SoleLuna Restaurant
41,"FOOD: 7/10SERVICE: 6.5/10AMBIANCE: 8.5/10RECOMMENDATION: beef satayYou people on yelp obviously never had good Thai food before cause this place is a 3 star at most. The only thing I would order here again is there beef satay and the Kao Soy. I wish they gave more of the crispy noodles for the Kao Soy cause they only give like a bites worth. The crispy taro shreds, Pat see ew, basil fried rice, and shrimp egg rolls were also nothing special. The shrimp cakes tasted good but didn't have the chewy texture that most shrimp cakes should have. I should also mention that the service here was also kind of slow. Over all this place was just average to me. There are plenty of other thai places in NY that I would much rather go to.",Good is good but the staffs are extremely rude! It's a cash only place which is again a bummer and while tipping they don't want to return the change!,"I ordered the clear soup with mixed veggies and seafood but I got was like just plain water. So disappointed. Not worth my hype. And the old lady with short hair was kinda rude to me and my friends. I remembered that we used very polite way of talking because we use the same language as them. By the time we were paying the order, the register called over our head to the customers who just came in. I think this manner considered rude in Thai society. Anyhow, what I can give them for the compliment is cleanliness.","Best Thai restaurant in Queens! Everything is delicious and there is outdoor seating too! CASH ONLY!Location: It is located in Woodside Queens. The restaurant is big with a lot of seating, there is a very cute outdoor seating as well for the summer. There is a huge line during weekend specially at night.Service: They are okay, some of them does not speak English so be patient. Food: PAD THAI: one of my favorite! Very authentic pad thai, it has extra cashews at the side, make it beef! SOFT SHELL CRAB: omg this is so good before it comes with coconut soup with squash but I guess during summer its mango salad! Both are delicious with the crab. MANGO SALAD: it is perfect combination with all the fried foods they offer, perfect amount of spice. FRIED WHOLE SNAPPER: the fish is big and well deep fried, combined it with mango salad! SAUTÉED VEGETABLES with FRIED PORK: the vegetables are not overly cooked and has a crunch on it, the fried pork belly are good addition to it. PINEAPPLE FRIED RICE: omg my favorite rice, so good you can eat it on its own! THAI ICED TEA: so creamy and add some bubbles for texture!Price rating: 6/10 very affordable but cash only!Best Thai restaurant for me! Everything is good! Good for family gatherings!","Love their thai food very much! Sadly there isn't much good thai restaurants in brooklyn. But it is worth traveling to Woodside for decent thai food. I love their drunken noodle, massaman w/ coconut rice, satay, thai ice tea and sticky rice w/ mango dessert. Super delicious and not too expensive! Staff was nice and friendly, and the decor is mod. Cash only!","I'll have to say it's around 3.5 stars.My first time here was with my family after my aunt had this on her to-go list for a while. We got lucky with parking, but you'll have to fight for street parking at certain times. Came again with a friend a couple of days ago and everything seems to be the same as I remembered.I started off with a Thai Iced Tea and the Combination Spring Rolls (Regular and Spicy) to share. I probably should've told them less sweet, but this was just as overly sweet as I remembered from last time (Okay, I really should've been smarter). I got the Red Curry with Chicken and a side of Brown Rice while my friend got the Pad See Ew. My Red Curry: The flavors were all there, but I didn't like how the texture of the curry was gritty. It seemed like they keep it boiling for so long that some vegetables or meat were disintegrating and creating that dissolved texture. I'm not mad about it, but I didn't enjoy it as much because of the texture. The flavors were perfect though and the medium spice level was that nice amount of spice for me! The Pad See Ew: Now, my friend is a huge fan of Kin'd because Kin'd tends to be more heavy handed with their flavors, aka saltier. I quote my friend when I say, ""The Pad See Ew is more mild than the one at Kin'd"". I don't think this necessarily is a bad sign, but I don't think my friend would come back as he prefers the flavors at Kin'd. I did taste that SriPraPhai's Pad See Ew was less flavorful than Kin'd, but I normally eat less salty so I thought it was okay. Service: The waitress that served us was super nice though! We asked to move outside and she warned us beforehand about bugs and caterpillars if we moved. Loved that she always had a smile on her face. Very sweet! Overall, both experiences were nothing spectacular and I wouldn't choose to venture out to Woodside just to eat here. If I'm in the area, I'll consider going here (also why I decided to try this place or a second time).",SriPraPhai Thai Restaurant
42,"Totally confused as to how this place has such a high rating given that the food is always hit or miss. I've had plates come out where it tasted like they forgot to salt everything, and I've had some stuff that was pretty good but never knocked it out of the park. Most importantly: Don't come here for brunch unless you want a shitty cup of coffee with your meal! The food is o k but the coffee is consistently drab. It always tastes watered down, like they forgot to change the grounds or keep reusing them. Also don't have any equipment to make hot espresso beverages, which is kind of a bummer for brunch. Basically if you plan on drinking coffee with brunch go somewhere else.","The food and service was incredible. Went for dinner, haven't had that consistently good meal in a loooong time.","A couple of things went awry due to expectations but also the place itself...1. Julia's serve brunch until dinner time! To me and according to the dictionary brunch means something between breakfast and lunch... not necessarily when it comes to Julia's. Wish I could have seen and ordered from the dinner menu for lunch. We did not feel like having eggs or waffles for lunch. 2. Decided to suck it up and enjoy the pretty setting with a  drink. But it turned out that they were out of the prickly pear puree. Sometimes, when you are out of certain dishes and ingredients you get a heads up... so that you do not figure your order and have to rehash.After this we decided to leave... I'd go back for dinner time or for breakfast, but do not recommend the place for lunch...unless you would like breakfast food.","Julia's is the neighborhood bar that you wish you had in your neighborhood (and/or the neighborhood bar that will strongly encourage you to move to Ridgewood). It's super homey, with a bar and window seating area right as you walk in, followed by a small separate dining room.Judging by most of their reviews most people choose Julia's for brunch, but I can attest that their dinner is solid as well. We opted to share a couple of items, which turned out perfectly. Their beet salad had all the usual suspects, including big slabs of beets, walnuts, arugula, and goat cheese. It was topped with an out of this world pesto that I wanted to drizzle on everything. We then shared the toasted goat, which was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a while. Creamy, melted goat cheese was paired with fig spread and bacon on delicious grilled bread, with an accompanying side salad and carrot slaw.And how could we turn down dessert? We shared a deconstructed key lime cheesecake, which came with graham cracker crumbles, plenty of whipped cream, and a berry sauce.Our waitress was lovely, and Julia's was the perfect place to spend a cold and rainy evening. I'll definitely be back to check out their brunch soon!","We are a fan of sister establishment Norma's, so eating at Julia's has been on our list for a while. It was a somewhat busy Sunday when we visited, but the server seated us right away and was friendly and accommodating to us and our little baby. We ordered the Vegan Veggie Hash and Arepas Con Huevos. My husband also ordered the non-alcoholic version of their lavender lemonade.  Both plates were delicious and the drink was nice too. When my husband was at the last quarter of his drink, he remarked that he felt the symptoms he usually gets when he drinks alcohol. Sure enough, I saw him getting flushed and dizzy. While he doesn't have a full-on alcohol allergy, the symptoms are strong enough that he avoids alcohol altogether. We asked the server if she had accidentally put in an order for the alcoholic lemonade (that has soju) but she hadn't. The server checked with the bartender and told us that the bartender didn't remember which drink she had made because she had made so many, so it was possible that it did have soju in it. I found this worrying because my husband could have had a more serious reaction. If anything, there needs to be a better system to distinguish the alcoholic drinks from the non-alcoholic ones. They comped us for the drink, which was a nice gesture. We'll still come back for the great food and atmosphere, but will probably avoid the non-bottled drinks in the future.","Brunch spot by day and bar lounge by night, Julia's is the epitome of local charm. I'm already hooked by this neighborhood gem and it's already become my go-to for brunch when I'm in town. The front room near the entrance serves as an elegant bar area. The adjacent room is a beautiful sit-down dining area. Julia's serves a small brunch menu but trust me when I say that every little thing on the plate tastes good. We ordered the Steak and Egg Scramble and the Old Standby. Like I said, everything was delish from the bread to the potatoes, but most notably the steak and the giant bacon. Today, the Pumpkin Pillows (pancakes) were served as Chocolate pillows instead. My regret this whole trip was to not order these Chocolate Pillows because when I saw someone order these while on my way out, OMG.. my jaw dropped. Next time :/Service is sweet from all the servers here. Feels like being served by a friend that cares. Be smart and bring your loved one to Julia's.",Julia's
43,Cool neighborhood bar with a great vibe inside. They have some killer cheese plates and offer a good selection of wines. They also have trivia nights every once and awhile. My only complaint is the bartenders can be slow at times and the bathrooms aren't always the cleanest.,"Went in last night at 9:40 and plenty of servers were walking around but no one was saying hi, nothing. For ten minutes, no one said anything to us and then we left. Upon leaving, we saw the chalkboard that said you had to go to the bar to order.  That is fine but who reads all the chalkboard as they enter a restaurant when it's basically an asterisk at the bottom? No thanks. And a server could easily have said, ""Hey folks, at this point in the night, you can order at the bar!"" Lost out on customers.",So my husband live by the area ! After a long day of work we decided to stop by and try a drink ! Honestly the drink was good but the service was so bad! The bartender looked so bored and mad! She was so moody ! My husband asked her nicely if she can please change his drink because the beers are not good at all! She was so upset and said no! And of course we were going to pay for it ! Also when I asked her for my cocktail she didn't even add a straw! For me ! So disappointed we thought we were going to have an awesome time we literally live up the block! We might come back but hopefully that bartender girl with short hair blue eyes won't be there!!,"Food: 5/5I love wine and charcuterie. This place has a great selection of meats and cheese! The prosciutto and manchego were phenomenal! To make matters even better, it came with olives, crostinis, grapes and sliced apples! Their house cabernet was also very memorable. The meats and cheese are $8 per selection. I'm so happy I found this place!Service: 5/5Bartender was very nice and accommodating. He recommended I try a cheddar cheese which I also loved. Thank you!Ambiance: 4/5Cute, intimate place! Sort of dark but would be a great date spot. Sort of has a rustic/ bohemian feel.","$45 prix fixe deal includes a bottle of wine and your choice of 3 cheeses or meats. And this is on a Saturday night too. What a deal!Don't expect table service though. You walk in, order at the counter, and find a table. However, it's still a cool, classy vibe and you get to try some great cocktails at a fairly decent price. Amazing find in the area!",This was a really nice late night discovery. Very nice spot with great service and delicious food and drinks. The place has a very laid  back environment and is cozy yet trendy.,The Beast Next Door
44,"The staff was really nice. The food was okay, just wish there was rice or something else to eat the meat with. Didnt really like the dipping sauce, not enough variety. I really do not recommend the pork skin because that thing is has no taste and is soggy/squishy.","Is just another AYCE Korean bbq. My only complaint, is not comfortable to sit ob this tiny garbage bin. Other than that, food and service are decent.","Was excited this place was opening and watch the construction for a while...and finally got to try it last night. The cast iron pot...was nice. The meat was bland and dry af. The food I can add salt and make better but the thing that pissed me off the most was the SERVICE. The service SUCKED. The restaurant had 5 tables and about 5 waiters and you can get no one's attention. Maybe they do it on purpose so you can't order more. One waiter tall skinny face was standing in front of me and I was like EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME and he just kept looking down. Finally I said EXCUSE MEEEEE and he looked up like he had heard me many times and just decided to ignore me. And then, gave me a dirty look and said ONE SECOND. He was doing NOTHING at the moment and I was NOT interrupting him. So the bland food plus the awful service. NOT COMING BACK and will let all the friends know.","Service: 4/5Food: 4/5Value: 5/5My new go-to spot for korean BBQ - this Place is truly exceptional. We went as a group for lunch on Saturday and had the AYCE dinner menu selection which includes a vast array of cuts including galbi and brisket. We also ordered the steamed egg and spicy beef soup as sides and lettuce leaves which is available upon request. My favorite way to enjoy Korean BBQ is wrapping the meat with salad, and bean sprouts in lettuce before dipping this concoction in A variety of dipping sauces - it's a dreamy and delicious experience that I'm still thinking about days after our amazing meal. Compared to other Korean BBQ restaurants in Manhattan, the quality of the meats here may be less premium but in terms of value this restaurant is simply phenomenal. I haven't found any other place offering the same quality and quantity for such a great value. We might have ordered 10 rounds of meat and I might have consumed 1 million calories that day but I left happy and well fed and for me that's a day well spent!","came in on a thursday around 1:30 PM to find that i actually have a choice between their lunch/dinner menu at $18.95/$28.95 per person. (might not the biggest deal for most but having an option is always nice, esp. if you're ballin'/eatin' on a budget :p)opted for the dinner menu despite the cost as it seems to offer a better assortment of beef dishes, including the top blade steak, hanging tender steak, and cast iron pot galbi steak, which the lunch menu does not.like any other menu, there were some hits but also a few misses. the top blade steak and galbi steak were both super tender and marinated to perfection. however, the hanging tender steak was a miss for me as it was a bit more chewy/gamey than the top blade in my opinion. i also preferred the pork jowl over the pork belly, which typically wouldn't be the case if i was dining at other KBBQ places, but the pork belly, as others have also mentioned, is more lean/meaty than fatty at cast iron.as someone who never bothers with food reviews (bc restaurants are never amazing/terrible enough for me to do so and also bc i'm lazy), i wanted to leave this review mainly to commend the staff who served me today, one of them being chris and the other, whom i didn't get the chance to catch the name of, but you know who you are! these two were exceptional in their service in that they were very attentive and the no name guy even made a bowl of mixed kimchi fried rice just for my table after seeing me struggle to make my own version of it with just kimchi and white rice. lol. it was such a sweet/unexpected gesture that i just had to write about it.all in all, i would recommend cast iron to anyone who's craving AYCE KBBQ around flushing but i can see how this place can get busy really fast, so def. choose when you decide to come wisely!","I've been to multiple AYCE Korean BBQ spots, from K-town to Flushing.This is by far one of the best using the traditional Cast Iron Pot lid. Dare I say even better than the one in the city that uses a suggestion to see someone as their name. The cuts of meat here are fresh and plentiful. they keep it coming and the waitstaff is always pleasant. Beef soup really helps to cut the heaviness of pork belly and the Steamed Egg is a welcomed addition to the AYCE menu. I highly recommend trying this spot out. Prices are about $30.00 pp on busy weekend nights. Be prepared to wait on busy nights 20-40 minutes as they get busy super quick!",The Cast Iron Pot 3
45,"09/30After an awful first time experience we decided to give this place another shot. We had a veal parm and penne vodka. Food was good. The problem with this restaurant is the front of the house. It's poorly run and operated. The staff members act as if they dont care, there's no interaction, no service, it's just down right awful. We were seated in the garden area. Promptness of food arrival was ok. We asked for the two young men who in our previous visit assisted us, and were told they no longer work there. What a shame. Good food, but service is horrendous.","This is the last time I will go to this restaurant. While the food is still good the service is atrocious. The waiters who have been there for years are complacent and down right lazy.They fail to take an interest in a customer who is not a regular. That's fine but new business is what keeps a restaurant thriving.The waitstaff on both occasions failed to bring my complete meal. Having to take pasta or salad home in a bag. No apologies, they never visit table to see how the food is they are too busy checking phones or gabbing with other employees.Such a shame. The owner needs to revamp his waitstaff for people who want to work instead of letting them destroy his  restaurants reputation.Stay away unless you like paying 100.00 and be treated like dirt.",One of my most worse service experiences.Sat for 29 minutes at the bar with no service. Sat for an hour with no service at dinning room. When friend's came a bread basket was dropped on the table yet still no service. Then after 45 min a waiter came orders were taken and then only bus boys came to get further orders and pick up dishes.The waiters were to busy at a meeting over a cell phone just 5 feet away from us. Hooray for the bus boys John and Clever  who serviced our table while the  A. hole waiters sowed their oats among themselves.,"Came here for a family dinner and it was a truly great experience.I'll start off with saying, I was waiting out front for a little bit since I traveled separately from my family. A man approached me and was just standing and staring at me, not moving. One of the valet guys actually came over to check on me and make sure I was okay - which I thought was a great gesture. Now onto the food, we started with a few apps: calamari, prosciutto & mozzarella, caesar salad, stuffed mushrooms. All phenomenal, especially the stuffed mushrooms. We could have eaten triple. For entrees, I got the langoustines, my brother got the chicken parm, my dad got the shrimp fri diablo, and my mom the veal parm. They all loved their dishes but I can't speak enough about the langoustines. They were AMAZING. We devoured them. It came with a side of pasta and not a bite went uneaten. Really enjoyed this place. We all said the only place it came second to was Il Mulino in the city, otherwise, probably the best we've had.","What a disappointment. Many close friends recommended this place to us, so we had very high expectations. From the moment we walked in we felt unwelcomed. The lady at the front desk didn't bother to even greet us, the only thing she asked me was if I had a reservation with a very irritated face. We had a reservation at 7:30pm and we were not seated until 9pm. We waited close to 20 minutes before our waiter came to the table. The waiter was very nasty and arrogant. As he was giving us the menus he didn't even bother to greet us or even look at us, it felt like greeting customers wasn't the norm in this restaurant. Our drinks took way to long to arrive considering that the bar was just 20 steps away. My wife and I were debating whether to stay or leave because everything was just going downhill. We were ready to place our order but our waiter was nowhere to be found, my wife was fed up so she got up to look for our waiter and turns out our waiter was too busy enjoying a nice glass of wine and texting on his phone. At this point I was ready to walk out, but we were starving and we waited over an hour and a half and we didnt think anything else can get worse, but it did. As an appetizer we had a stuffed artichoke which was delicious, no complains about the food so far. For our entree we decided to share the Park Side T-Bone steak. We ordered the steak medium rare, which in any restaurant in New York will be ready in no more then 30 minutes. It wasn't busy, an hour had past and neither our food or our waiter were anywhere to be found. We tried asking other staff for our waiter and it felt as if everyone was avoiding us. We kept waving at the staff until the front desk lady decided to step in. We asked if we may please see our waiter and explained that it's been a very long time and we were still waiting for our food. Her response was ""I don't cook the food, just wait"" she then proceeded to call someone else over because she felt that as customers we were not worthy of her time. She called over a big young man that was wearing a tuxedo, at that moment we thought that maybe he was the manager, but he then explained to us that he was just a waiter, at least he was friendly and willing to help. He ran to the kitchen and brought our food to the table. Our T-bone was undercooked and the sauce on our pasta was bland, and it was obviously sitting in the kitchen for a while. After 15 minutes of sitting there eating, my original waiter decided to check up on us. We asked him what happened and why did our food take a long time to come. His response was ""I dont know, that's how things are here this isn't McDonald's."" After hearing that my wife couldn't even look at him and dismissed him from the table. We asked the busboy (which was very helpful) if he can call over the other waiter that brought out our food. As he was leaving our table our waiter called over the busboy and asked him what was wrong and said something along the lines of "" That lady is crazy"" in Spanish. We finally got a hold of the other young waiter and he proceeded to apologize and offered to treat us to coffee and dessert, but we declined. Him, the busboy and the stuffed artichoke were the only positive things we experienced on our first and last time at the park side. We asked to speak to the manager, but the manager never approached us. We paid the check and left. The food is not bad but the service as a whole in this place is ridiculous. If you like waiting hours to be seated and like being disrespected by the staff then go to Park Side. I will never walk back into this place.","My new favorite Italian spot! Upon walking in, you could tell it was a local favorite as it was crowded around 2 pm on a Saturday. We were seated in the green room which was the perfect lunchtime setting. After reading some reviews, we ordered calamari and crab cakes. The calamari was decent - not too crispy/fried. The crab cakes were not what I expected, they weren't coated in bread crumbs, it was basically the crab mushed into a patty and served with mangos. It paired very well and tasted very fresh. For entrees, we had the lamb chops and chicken Parmesan. The lamb chops were perfectly seasoned but to my dismay, were smaller than expected. It was served with potato knishes and fried zucchini chips which I loved! The chicken parmigiana was hands down my favorite - there is no other way to describe it but as perfection. The bill ran us about $100, which was a little pricey, but decent for the portion sizes. I would visit again for the green room dining experience and chicken parm!!",Park Side Restaurant
46,"Authentic Korean restaurant! The dumpling soup with rice cakes was delicious! The Korean appetizers were a great start to the meal, and you could even ask for refills for the appetizers. Portions were incredibly large, so these dishes are well worth it's price! But the only negative part is that the staff is a bit pushy and rushed. Waitress who took our order didn't have anything to write our order on which I found odd. And because of that, one of our dishes was incorrect. Despite this, I would definitely come back with my family for lunch!","The food for alright. The service is not good at all. Asking four times for a glass of water, kimchi, or anything, the waitress doesn't care.","Come to this place for authentic Korean food. It's not all you can eat but the lunch specials here are a steal. We had the spicy pork and beef bulgogi which were good sizes for a lunch special. Along with the staple of side dishes, your meal was complete. $35 tax and tip for lunch. The service was attentive and the food came out quick. There's a reason the place was filled on a Monday afternoon.","I lent you my Hahm Ji last week, you said you'd return it within 2 days. It's been 8 days, and yes I'm counting. Please give me my Hahm Ji Bach, thx.This is one of my favourite stops in Koreatown Queens (Murray Hill close to Flushing and Bayside), because it's generous, affordable, yummy, and late night service is so nice.I'm not sure if it's 24 hours all the time - google says yes, and it has been on  the occasions I came here. In any case, it's perfect in the small hours, and I was really happy with everything here - they were really nice.I was able to get my favourite soup, and it was pretty cheap and tasty and filling and the perfect way to end a long, long day on Long Island.So if all your friends are on crackAnd Korean soup's something you lackI must give you fair warningThat at 2 in the morningThere's nothing like a Hahm Ji Bach.","I went here with my family and I was very happy to say that we did not wait as long as the other reviews mentioned. It was one of the best Flushing Ktown spots I found to date. I am not one to say that this is 100% authentic, but it definitely tasted that way and for the right price as well. You are welcomed right from the moment you walk in - which is great because I guess as Westerners you feel a little off when you walk into a restaurant like this. Combined with the warm welcoming, delicious authentic food, fair price, you can't go wrong here. The crowds that pile in are a true testament to their quality of food and service.",This restaurant use to be really good in the past but not anymore. After a long day in the city we decided to come to Hahm Ji Bach restaurant which serves Korean food Upon our arrival we were seated near the door and we decided to order the Goat Casserole for 3 people and few other Korean dishes. While we were waiting there were people celebrating their birthday and the restaurant played birthday music which was so loud that everyone was cringing their faces I mean it was so loud. Don't understand why they had to play the music so loud enough for a club . Finally When they brought out the Goat casserole it was so blend that we couldn't eat it. When we told this to the waitress they had this dumb look in their face like what do you want us to do. No one came to apologize and we had to tell them to take it back and bring a new Goat casserole out. I don't think we will be coming back to this location again. It's not like how it use to be. Also another thing that I noticed was that unless you order the Kalbi which is short rib in Korean or any other BBQ meat the waitress Treats you like dirt.,Hahm Ji Bach
47,"I see potential in this place. I used to go to Flushing all the time for Nanxian and Carma East in the city for what I deem to be the best soup dumplings in NYC. So when Bund opened I was excited to have one much closer to home. But I was slightly disappointed in the flavoring. The cucumber appetizer and soup dumplings were waaayyy too sweet. Tasted like they tossed in a bunch of sugar. I got sick of the taste pretty quickly.  The pan fried rice cakes were good but too oily. You could see a pool of oil sitting at the bottom and the food was doused in it. The service is average. We had ordered a pork soup dumpling and a crabmeat soup dumping. As we started eating the second basket of dumplings we thought it was strange that it tasted exactly like the first basket of soup dumplings. But because we were disappointed by the flavoring already we just chocked it up to an inexperienced chef. We didn't realize they gave us two pork dumpling baskets until I noticed in other yelp photos that the crabmeat dumpling is supposed to have the telltale orange peak. Because we had already eaten everything already we didn't mention it to the staff, but I was kind of disappointed by the situation. I don't want to make it sound like they have bad food. There's certainly potential. I would just advise that they lessen the amount of sugar they add to the flavoring of the food and less oil too.","The negative review is only for the service from the front desk. I ordered takeout tonight and she mixed up the order, at first I was only trying to give them a call to let them know what happened, but their phone doesn't work either, so I had to go all the way back, which is upsetting enough, the worse is the front desk doesn't even offer a single word of sorry, that's totally unacceptable.In the end the manager David took care of it professionally and got the phone fixed, the stars go to him.","Food: 3/5Service: 2/5Atmosphere: 2/5Food: We got the Bund Special Beef Stew Noodle Soup (forgot about pictures until I finished this dish) and the Sautéed Udon Noodle with Shredded Beef and Hot Peppers. The beef and the soup in the noodle soup were good, but the noodles were flavorless and were a bit mushy. The udon was decent but way too salty and nothing special.Service: When we entered, there was no one in the hostess stand and two people sitting at a table. We looked at the menu while we waited and the hostess finally showed up after a few minutes. The moment we said we were dining in, the two seated people immediately jumped from their seats to serve us. I didn't realize they were waiters and was a bit peeved they had us wait even though they weren't doing anything and knew we were there. The hostess had a bad attitude greeting us and seating us and the waiters provided the bare minimum service. Atmosphere: The place looked bright and clean, but the tables were SO sticky. Upon closer look, the seats were dirty. The hostess and a waiter sat at a table very near us during their break and started talking about things that made me lose my appetite.","I like Bund... a lot. I'm so happy there's finally an authentic Chinese restaurant in Astoria (authentic = NOT American takeout and usually sticks to ONE cuisine in the restaurant). Honestly, I read some of the reviews here and they are petty af, these people really shouldn't be eating out. Here's the thing, my rule with rating authentic Asian restaurants is to never rate the service because that's not what I'm here for. I'm straight up here for food. As usual, I always get the soup dumplings. The pork soup dumplings are deliciously rich and slightly sweet. I just tried their shrimp soup dumplings and those are lighter but still tasty. I don't think the place automatically gives you the vinegar unless you ask for it, probably because they're used to the demographic of the neighborhood to not know how to use the vinegar. The cucumber salad is great as well. Just slightly wilted with garlic and salt. Soft yet still has that crunchiness a shanghainese cucumber salad would give you. I love their mushroom salad. It is a very shanghainese dish that goes very well with rice because it adds a lot of flavor and also slightly salty. Overall, Astoria doesn't have a lot of restaurants I listed on my ""repeat"" list (places i genuinely want to go to or have gone to again and again ex: Astoria Seafood, Taverna Kyclades, Koroni Souvlaki and Grill, Los Portales) and Bund is on that list.","Updating to 5 stars. Came again for lunch yesterday (think they're past soft opening now) and felt the food has gotten better! Soup dumplings were delicious and juicy. Got the udon noodles again - they were slightly salty last time and was pleasantly surprised, great flavor this time! Noodles are pretty big so would recommend getting to share unless you're not getting appetizer. Prices are great, spent less than $30 for two appetizers and an entree. Really happy to finally see an authentic Chinese place in Astoria! I think they're in their soft opening phase so the menu is a little limited, hope they expand on that. Cute cozy littleCame for lunch today, we got both the pork and crabmeat soup dumplings, really delicious. Cucumber salad was biggest serving I've seen in the city. Also had the pan fried udon noodles, really big serving as well but the sauce was a little on the salty side. Will definitely come back once they have a bigger menu!","Really happy to finally see an authentic Chinese place in Astoria!

48,"We drove here from UES to try this place. We just left starving. We ordered so much food: pan fried pork buns, yang chow fried rice, pan fried noodles with pork, shrimp and fish and soy sauce duck. As we began eating, my partner realized there was a MAGGOT in her food. We were disgusted and repulsed. We got the attention of a server and he said ""oh shit"" and began to chuckle. He brought back some dessert and said ""do you want me to take that off or make it again?"" ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? No acknowledgement. No apology. We left all of the other uneaten food there and paid and left. This place is gross and I'm praying we don't get sick. Do not go. UPDATE:The owner responded and is flat out lying. How tacky and dishonest can you be!? This is definitely your restaurant and your disgusting food. I checked in while I was there. Why would I lie about this being from your restaurant?","We drove here from UES to try this place. We just left starving.

It was pretty busy, so they gave us a pager to tell us when our table would be ready. Interestingly, they also allowed us to place our orders before we were even seated.We ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings, spicy beef tendon, and the chicken pan fried noodles. The beef tendon was sliced thin, covered in chili oil, and served cold. Tasty, but not my favorite preparation. The soup dumplings were very good, but some broke apart because they were stuck to the paper. The pan fried noodles were OK.Decent spot, worth a visit","The food here is sooo good!!! I came here with a group of friends during lunch on a Sunday...it took us about 30 minutes to get seated. They give out cookies and tea for free while you wait.We got a bunch of foods to share. The highlights for me were the sweet tofu mushroom, egg yolk covered tofu, and the old duck soup.I highly recommend this place, prob my fave Shanghainese restaurant in NY so far.","Came here on a Monday morning around 9:30 ish and the wait line was significantly shorter. Oh wait, there was no wait line. There were a few tables available upon walk in and they seated my sister and I immediately.We ordered the Three-Colored Xiao Long Bao (Shrimp, Crab and Pork), Spicy Pork Veg Wontons, Shanghai Special Chicken, and Watercress Dumplings. All of the dishes tasted really good, but the spicy pork veg wontons surprised me. I thought the veg part would be cabbage or something. I definitely wasn't expecting the watercress (?) in it. Was pleasantly surprised though to be given a three-tiered stack of baskets, when we only ordered two. When it came time to settle the bill, I asked, and was told they offer a complimentary basket of soup dumplings on orders over $10. And they've been doing it for 5 years straight.I do wish I knew of this earlier, though, so perhaps I wouldn't have ordered as much. Came out stuffed. Had I eaten anymore, I probably would've turned into a dumpling myself.Service was impeccable. We ended up giving a bit more than 20% gratuity.","With Nan Xiang XLB temporarily closed, I needed to find somewhere in Flushing for my fill of Shanghainese classics. For a vegetarian, that means not XLB, but rather steamed veggie dumplings, chive pockets, tzong-yo mien (scallion noodles), and cold dishes like kao-fu (baked tofu).All of the food here was just as good as Nan Xiang. The steamed veggie dumplings were filled with a delicious medley of what I presume to be leeks, eggs, and glass noodles, and paired perfectly with a bit of vinegar and ginger on a spoon. The chive pocket was a bit more deep fried than I tend to prefer, but the filling was still good (take note it does contain dried shrimp). Scallion noodles could have been a bit more flavorful, but still a solid option.If I have one complaint, it is the efficient but rather impersonal seating set-up. You order while waiting so by the time you sit (for us it was about a 40 minute wait on a Friday evening at 8:40) your food comes out shortly. But as soon as you've taken the last bite, a sweet soup is promptly delivered to the table with a clear message.",Shanghai You Garden
49,"Heard this was the only Michelin Star restaurant in Queens, decided to give it a try. I'll say it's good but I'm not super duper impressed by it, maybe it's because of the food I ordered and I think food are too sour for me (personal preference, I absolutely hate anything that's sour). I had enchiladas, accidentally ordered another one with chicken in it instead of the mole sauce, too sour (again, personal preference here). If I would have ordered mole sauce I'll probably love it very much. No matter what, still a good place and I will recommend people to come try this place.","I know this place comes with lots of bells and whistles, but I was truly disappointed, unfortunately. Service was below standard and food was simply meh. I had the steak, which was mediocre to say the least. hosts weren't welcoming at all, and we had to wait even though we had a reservation. I had expected better. Will not return.","I know this place comes with lots of bells and whistles, but I was truly disappointed, unfortunately. Service was below standard and food was simply meh.

Restaurant was pretty empty on a Tuesday at 9 PM, but was busy the next Monday around the same time, though I was seated almost immediately. The staff are friendly and helpful and service is prompt.Overall, the food is excellent. It's not flashy, or even particularly fancy, but it tastes great and there was clearly thought and effort put in. My favorite dish over the two visits was the mole de piaxlta. The meat was tender and very flavorful. I also enjoyed the guacamole. On my second visit I had the chiles nogada, a traditional seasonal specialty. The dish consists of a pablano pepper stuffed with meat and dried fruits topped with a creamy sauce. I found that there wasn't as much meat as I'd have liked, and it was pretty sweet. I'd say it was a good dish but not very amenable to my tastes. The high quality carries through to the drinks and desserts. Both the tres leches and cheese ice cream were excellent; they were also very rich and filling.It tells you a lot that this is the only restaurant I repeated in a few weeks in New York. Apart from being delicious, t food (and ambiance) is comforting, the prices are reasonable, and you'll likely leave with your stomach full. The most important qualities for a restaurant in my book!","When I asked a friend where to brunch in LIC he only told me one place: Casa Enrique. First off the prices are amazing for a Michelin Star. No different than a typical New York restaurant which is pretty cool. We started with the absolutely delicious ceviche which was fresh, light, and well seasoned. I actually had read on their website they had molletes, my absolute favorite breakfast from Mexico that I grew up with my mom making and had looked forward to them all day. Imagine my disappointment to enter and see they had removed them from the menu - could have cried tbh. But, I had the huevos rancheros they were very good. It's rare to find huevos rancheros that are made as I know them to be in Mexico in the United States and these were the closest to them I've had here. They were tasty with a nice little kick. My friend had the mole enchiladas which I tasted and were also delicious. Service was good but disappointing the waitress didn't even know what molletes were even when I showed them to her on the menu. I hope they bring them back!","Casa Enrique is WAS favorite restaurant in NYC. This place changed :( The food is still amazing, but portions SHRUNK and Prices gone up!It's classic dishes served in a first class manner.It's also a short walk to the water front, so you can enjoy a nice walk after a great meal.",Casa Enrique
50,"Went here for my moms bday. Food was whack , pork chop , ceviche, grilled chicken, The only good thing was the salmon and the paella, but not to die for.  Drinks weren't that creative or tasty. We complained about our food and got free shots.  It was just a little disappointing","Mamajuana advertise themselves too much for what it really is. The food was too expensive and had no flavor.  There was bad service. After I went to mamajuana,I checked the reviews on yelp, and to be honest, I am not the only who thinks this.  There are a lot of people who agree with me because there are more bad reviews then good ones. If I would've read them first, I wouldn't have gone. I Don't recommend this restaurant to anyone.  PLEASE, READ THE REVIEWS.","This is probably the worst service I ever had in a restaurant in queens. It was taco Tuesday. We understand that it does get crazy busy because it's a great deal, but for such deal, management should be aware to have extra staff or organization for such day. Our server was rude, no greeting and super sweaty, he literally looked like he was running a marathon. We felt bad for him because he looked so overwhelmed. Anyway, then a roach was crawling on our table, and we called management, the manager apologized and we accept it with no problem, i mean bad things happen... Then we asked for our bill, and we realized we were overcharged with at least $100 extra from what we really consumed. It was awful, we were 10 people, we did 3 rounds of tacos and 3 rounds of $2 Margaritas and 4 coronas. That's super easy math. We tried to locate the manager but he was no where to be found. At the is point we were just pissed. Since we were 10 people we decided to just go and split the $100 and give free $10 to Mamajuana for such a bad service. It's terrible because the food is actually good. Reply for Oscar,I understand the fact that you must keep your business with a great look. I totally get it. But we definitely did not consume the amount of tacos we were billed for, because why would i go out of way to write such review? And you are right, my account is new because i felt disappointed for what we went through, and somehow it felt unfair to just let it slide, which is a good reason of ""hey, why not rate"". Regarding to the pitcher of margarita that was brought to the table, it doesn't excuse the workflow performed or the lack of communication with the server. The pitcher (2$ margarita mix pitcher, not 90$  worth  mojito as you mentioned) was no comfort for us. I believe it was the least they could've done because of the roach incident.Like i mentioned before, the food is great and so is the club, but the restaurant part isn't its strength. I don't considered myself ""mean"" Oscar, i just had a bad experience. I appreciate your feedback, and thank you for  taking your time reading my review.","Today we were celebrating my birthday during brunch hours and it was AMAZING!!!!! This is my 3rd time celebrating my birthday here and not once have I ever had any negative experiences. Waitresses, hostess and bartenders were attentive, professional and most of all extremely nice. The DJ was fantastic, shout outs through out the whole duration of us being there and the vibe was positive. The food was delicious and fresh. The mimosas & sangria were all definitely on point. Thank you to the AMAZING manager who not only accommodated us but took the time to speak with us (which was a group of 16) just to make sure everything was good and if we needed anything more. Gino you're the best....can not wait to come back.Thank you to everyone on staff for making my day special!","Honestly People should Go to The Restaurant then Critique it if U want to...But don't let others Experiences Get in the way. I came to Mama Juana's Cafe a few years ago and it was Good but I forgot about it. Until I Discovered how close it was to My Boyfriend's House and We went Back..Well since June we've been back a few times. And Everytime the service and food gets better. The Presentations of The Dishes are Beautiful,The Drinks hit The Spots and The Waiters are so Respectful and attentive without being in your Face. Even The Water Man is on point Everytime. Love The Place and The Food.","The food is seasoned PERFECTLY! I came here for a birthday brunch and just a heads up, please get here on time. The reservations were for 11am, we got here around 11:20am and then had to look for parking so que another 5-10 minutes of lateness. The location of this restaurant is so weird. It's like smack dab in the middle of the road, on the corner.  That's were the one star gets taken away. If my party and I were to come any later, parking will be non existent.We came here for the brunch and for something that only last for two hours, it's goes by fast! They have unlimited mimosas and rum punch and as an occasional drinker ... that rum punch was strong (but it was HITTING!)The food variety was excellent! Salami, cheese, rice , pasta dishes, chicken , plantains. It was great!! I will most certainly return , but only on a Sunday morning.",Mamajuana Cafe Queens
51,"Used to come here quite often but the past weekend was my first time in a while and I was surprised to find out that they implemented a minimum spend amount in order to be seated?!I was taken back a bit that a bar in flushing is enforcing such a rule when very high end bars in Manhattan dont even do that. I'm not trying to say that Flushing isn't upscale but this isnt like a comedy club where such policies are acceptable/common. Moves like this come off as catering to your margins over your customers and simply in poor taste.I would say a majority of the people who come to leaf come from flushing/queens and are just looking for a place to hang out on the weekends. The last thing they want is to feel judged when trying to wind down after a rough week in their own 'home/neighborhood'. Very pretentious for a place that shouldnt be. The tougher pill to swallow was that by 10 oclock the place started emptying out significantly anyway, makes you think: did the doorman insist on the drink minimum after 10:30 to 11:00 when it was empty? Probably not, which just makes the move seem driven by greed.Food, service, and drinks were good. My review is only based on my experience walking in and being told that I have to spend a certain amount to sit down. I can garuntee that my party wouldve spent more money had we not been given those stipulations and had our mood ruined.It makes a lot more sense to ask guests who are loitering and not ordering enough drinks to simply order more. Instead of upfront telling people at the door.","The roof top bar was great. The vibe, seating, view, and space. The bartender was a ass. Like we were ruining his day to that he had to serve drinks. People were at bar, ignored them and then saexaatic do you want a drink.....duhhh or dooohhh...","Horrible customer service . We booked for 6:30 pm on a Friday evening and we were seated , ordered at 6:40 and then we were told that it is a 30 $ minimum per person after 7 but since we might be her past 7 pm then that includes us ( also we weren't told about the 30 $ minimum on reservation ) while this is happening , we were asked to move to a different table as they are expecting a bigger group . Last time coming here , what a way to lose customers !","Hi Flushing Yelpers and friends.  I'm so happy I discovered the leaf Rooftop Bar in Flushing. BIG thanks to our local Yelp CM Jando who let us know about Flushing's finest sunset spot. Leaf Bar is Located on the tippy top of the new Hyatt hotel in Downtown  Flushing, NY. Just 2 blocks from my residence and I didn't even know it was here. Well now I do ! Wifey and I decided to do Advanced Recon the night before the Labor Day party. Emerging from the rooftop floor elevator of the Hyatt on 39th Ave (a block north of Roosevelt Ave.& west of Main Street. The first thing you see is one of their huge screen TVs with the ball game on. The vibe tonight was excited and vibrant. You could hear the din of the folk's exuberance. Wifey and I were escorted to experience one of Flushing's most beautiful views. Our rooftop seating looked Westward, with the sunset to starlit skies of Manhattan before us in awe, beauty and splendor.Wife said the view was really breathtaking. Our waitress brought out two complementary shots from the manager to welcome his first time customers. We're loving the place already.(Part 2) Labor Day rooftop party. Time to relax friends. Wifey and I returned to Leaf bar the next day. there was a Yelp advertised Labor Day rooftop party. That I learned about from my Yelp friend Jando. We're not going to miss this. I needed to check out their foods, and there was a bottle of wine I just had to try. I had used my Yelp page to invite many friends from the area to this event. And they showed up. I have to thank my wonderful server, she also was the server from our the night before. She was on point and always there for every need we had. I love great service. sometimes it's more important than the food. The food on the rooftop was really outstanding this afternoon. Really hungry, we ordered 2 types of buffalo wings, crispy gyoza dumplings, cheeseburger spring rolls, Blue Moon beer, lemonades and a bottle of most delicious Argentinian wine. Highly recommended, the ""Terrazas de los Andes"" 2013, ia a Single vineyard, Los Aromos, Cabernet Sauvignon. ($120.) After decanting for 20 minutes, this Cav was just so deliciously smooth, it was like drinking liquid gold. Made the entire afternoon. Then mother nature decided to put on the most spectacular sunset show. Channeling the great artists Van Gogh and Monet. The sunset on the last day of August took on an surrealistic, impressionistic feeling. Accented by the wonderful company and that kicking Cab Sav, the heavens over Manhattan became as colorful and exciting as a Grucci fireworks display. All I could do was watch in amazement. Dusk turned to twilight and evening. All the lights of the city twinkled to life and The DJ started rocking, the crowd here really lit it up. So Happy Leaf bar just a few steps away in my neighborhood. Stock up on that incredible, Cav Sav. we'll be back again soon.","This place is overrated and quality of food/drink has declined over the past few years. The vibe is mostly 20-something millennials with a sprinkle of a few hotel guests on any given Friday or Saturday night. See and be seen. Cocktails are sweet and overpriced.  The bartenders remain the same. In this case, not sure if that's a good or bad sign. They've been making the same cocktails over and over for years. Instead of refining them to a tee, they're watered down and inconsistent. The outdoor area is a nice touch with comfortable lounging. Views leave much to be desired for a rooftop setting. Come for a round of drinks, maybe. Fair warning, you may leave feeling unsatisfied and ripped off. Cheers!","Made reservations for here on Saturday night at 11pm. Was seated promptly on the rooftop. I thought it would be too hot or too cold but the weather was really nice that day! - warm with a light breeze.I was here with 3 others - we all got drinks, i ordered the adult calpico. Although im not a big drinker, the drink tasted decently strong to me. (I think it contained soju, calpico, and marshmallow syrup) didnt really taste the marshmallow syrup but it did come with a marshmallow topping!Service was def not attentive at all. Had to wave and yell for the waiter to notice us, and sometimes had to ask for things twice.The food was decent- we ordered things like popcorn chicken and fries. Came out quickly as well! It was a really chill atmosphere and we did not feel rushed at all as we stayed there for about 2 hours. The 4 of us spent 113 without tip - just a little under the $120 ""mininum"" and they didnt really say anything so I guess the $30 pp rule is not strictly enforced. This price is not bad for drinks and food! Overall would come again for cheap drinks/food and the cool atmosphere.",Leaf Bar & Lounge
52,The food here really is delicious. The only thing I'd complain about is the price. A tad bit expensive for my blood. But everything was flavorful and hearty. I think that was the first time I finished my bowl of pho. Usually it's so big that I can't finish. I'll be back to try more dishes.,"This is my first time going to a Vietnamese Restaurant. The waiter was really nice and the restaurant was very mellow and I felt very relaxed. For my starter I had Bañh mi sliders which was really good!. I enjoyed it more than my entree. For my entree I had slow cooked beef short ribs that was served with a papaya salad. The ribs was really good, but I didn't enjoy my papaya salad. I wish it came with something different because I ended up eating just the ribs by itself ""which I got tired of eating after a while. I would def go back and try something else.","2 stars and only for service - staff was prompt and friendly however I cannot justify paying $20 for a bowl of pho and still leave unsatisfied. Fiancé and I drove all the way from Brooklyn bc we heard good things about their noodle soups and we were craving Vietnamese food at the time. We ordered the District pho that everyone was raving about online however it was extremely mediocre; broth was not flavorful enough. Doesn't even taste like they used any real beef bones to cook the pho broth which is standard for any authentic bowl of beef pho.. The cherry on top is that any additional toppings cost extra - we ordered tendon and tripe and that was $2-3 extra...in summary, overpriced mediocre Asian food. My Fiancé is Vietnamese so we have had abundant experience eating out at Vietnamese places around the country and also making it at home and everything has honestly been much better than what this restaurant has to offer. Sadly The Vietnamese food scene in nyc remains a disappointment","The district pho was amazing!! Huge portion! And so so so so so delicious! So my friend and I have been here a few times and always had great service. This is a loud restaurant so it can be hard to hear people.The octopus appetizer is delicious but the pieces are a little big and awkward to bite/eat. Also the sauce it comes with is a little spicy but delicious. Love the tomato fried rice. I need to remember to ask for it to not have pepper for my toddler, but it is delicious the way it's meant to be.","I came to visit my friend in Astoria and i havent been here in a very long time!!! He tols me about it and it we all ordered pho and of course the chicken wings and taro fries to share.The taro fries were the highlight of the meal. It was tooo SLAMMIN and  crispy and the inside was almost sort of soft with the honey glaze on there was like YIKES! The wings were really good, crispy skin with juicy insides!","i came to dinner before movie with a group of friends one weekend. everyone either got pho or the steak and eggs. we got the chicken wings and taro fries to share. the taro fries were honestly the highlight of the meal for me. tooo perfectly crispy and the inside was almost sort of gooey. i think there was also some sort of soy honey glaze on therethe wings were also good. really crispy skin with juicy insides- probably cause there was a good layer of fat that melted during the fry the steak and eggs were good but i wouldn't say it was remarkable i think this place is slightly over priced for viet cuisine- but based on the interier, it is probably meant to give a more upscale vibe than your average chinatown pho place so it's acceptable once in awhile for group outing, date, or celebration i suppose.",District Saigon
53,"Among the vendors this year I haven't sampled in the past, the chopped cheese jibarito from Jibarito shack had a gooey and savory filling ensconced between crispy plantains.  The Brazilian steak sandwich from Viva Natural Foods was hearty, with the bread redolent of cheesiness that complemented the meat.","This place is unsanitary. I left without purchasing anything. We chose to drive in and the parking was a nightmare- plus we had to walk through mud to get to the market. The stalls are located on a dirt surface and the food is openly being prepared, so in my opinion it is all contaminated between the sweating of the cooks and the dirt circulating around the venue.",Disappointed to say the least. All the great spots I hit last year when I stopped by the Night Market are no longer there. Walked around for 35 mins and the only thing I got to eat was a potato on a stick. Nothing else seemed to do it for me,"Fall ,food and fun ! This event holds a special place in my heart.  I sat on a hill at the end of devouring all different types of food and watched people play,dance,sing and of course eat/drink without a concern of time . It was well into the night (9pm) and everyone was enjoying their time here without a care in the world. I love the artists they have dancers,DJ's and singers from all walks of life . Hawaiian dancers made my night they put on a great performance as well as the singing acts all free just bring a blanket to sit on or grab a picnic table seat. Food: ChefBoyarNetty was there tonight (missed her in July) and was worth the wait.  I love her personality and her food definitely was the bomb. She ran out of Soul Food Cupcakes before I got there ,but I hit her up on Instagram and she held one for me ! It was a cornbread cupcake with Mac n cheese inside with a pillowy bed of mashed potatoes ontop adorned with a delicious crispy chicken wing(5) I also had a dish of Mac n cheese and wings (6) that was equally great. I did purchase a biscuit to go with it (3) !Brazilian Steak Sandwich was next up on a smoked chipotle cheese bun. Spicy sauce ,but in a good way . I loved the bun and the steak was soft and seasoned well. It was lettuce, tomato and red onion taking it up a notch. Cotton Candy for dessert ? This line was long yet they moved quickly . They have around 10 choices of design. Flowers and characters($7/8). They have a bunny that will make anyone smile very cute . I chose the duckie and when I walked around with this on a stick all eyes were on me ,lol. Everyone wanted to know where I got it from and they were on their way to get one too.","Coming from Connecticut I didn't know what to expect or where to park,but GPS took me right to the event with no problem and found out that there's a huge lot that you could park at the museum there. I suggest you get there right when it opens or an hour beforehand to guarantee a spot it fills up fast. You will see that there is $25 parking right before if you don't want to take that chance, it's mostly parking for the baseball games, Mets Stadium is adjacent to the market. When you're walking in you notice words on the fence that change weekly . ""My Super Hero"" reads today for all the Dads on Father's Day weekend. Pretty cool picture/selfie moment ! Bring a backpack (you'll thank me later) to set up your personal picnic on the open field there in the park where a DJ is stationed . They have beer/wine conveniently there too !   My 1st stop was someone I have been following on IG , the Chinese Sugar Painting lady.  Very impressive! You could spin a wheel if you can't choose a character or they have some displayed. My seven-year-old chose a dog (5.00) he said it tasted just like cotton candy .  Next Twisted Potato..... You can watch them spiral the potato and cook it . Flavors are ketchup, BBQ, Cajun, Buffalo, cheese, salt and vinegar, sour cream and onion or the one I got parmesan garlic. They sprinkle it from a shaker right out the grease. It's airy and crispy very filling.  Twisting for Fun was up next . A balloonist that makes the coolest hats and more (5-6 bucks) my son decided on a squid for a hat very huge and cool.  Moffle Bar ------ I chose mochiko fried chicken ($5) with a plain moffle ($5) (stuffed with mochi) on the side and it's amazing. The chicken was little battered nuggets that complimented the Moffle perfectly. You can have a soy sauce ontop ,but we chose to have it  plain .  They had beef sticks and chicken for sale we devoured them so fast I didn't get a chance to take a picture or catch the name of the booth. I also tried Filipino ice cream called Ube (purple yam with coconut sport ) it's supposed to come with turon( thinly sliced fried bananas) but I just wanted to try the ice cream today. Very good and not sweet. They put a little chocolate sauce on top.  I can't wait to try more next week they're open for a few more weekends !","I love that they have a price cap so that everyone can enjoy all of the vendors. The food was great and I will need to go back to try places I didn't get toTry the shark sandwich, it was AMAZING!",Queens International Night Market
54,"After a stroll through Long Island City Piers, we decided to find some dinner, settling on John Brown Smokehouse. You know a BBQ place is good when you can smell the smoke. Unfortunately I couldn't, but my friend really wanted some BBQ.We got the half pound brisket and rib tips with fries and mac and cheese for sides. The fries were hand cut from potatos, but a little underseasoned and soggy. The mac and cheese needed more cheese. The brisket was a bit dry, not much fat. I preferred the rib tips. I really liked their ghost pepper BBQ sauce though. It was very spicy.","Out of all the BBQ I've had in the US (Nashville, Portland, Vancouver, Austin, Boston, Orlando, Atlanta, Fairbanks- yes, Alaska! & Newark to name a few) food here is average.  BBQ is tricky. It can get dry fast.  My burnt ends were dry.  The rib tips were not - but didn't have much for meat compared to other places. Prices were high for this area.  No AC inside - so sit outside.  Good IPA was $7 for a ""not honest"" 14-oz. Not a Pint.  Anyway- the two item platter with two sides was $28 before tip.  I may give the other place nearby a shot. Even though they only have 3 stars- can't imagine the meat would be any drier.Out the door, with 1 beer, food and a tip was $41. For the layout, average food, location, and no table service- about 20% over the value.","I've visited this restaurant for the second time and this time I requested take out. I am aware of the size portions they give which had me to return. The website does not have anything but the hours but going in I also New the prices. Once I receive my food I was very angry They charged me for a full slab of ribs and for a pound of rib tips but did not give me the food requested. I called them back and the guy answering hung up on me and I called him again. He did not want to make things right, after I traveled over 30 minutes to get to their facility and I notified him I will be writing this review.When I learned from this place is to check your order because everyone is an honest and they're not honest people to rectify the issue.","We were in the area and a friend suggested we go here.    Place was packed around 5pm on a Friday.  Prices haven't gone up.  You can get a sandwich for around $9, which is plenty, but I highly suggest getting sides and sharing them.Food is good here and good value.  The meat plates get you 1/3 lb of meat and a side for $15.  It's a lot of food.  I also like that they serve white bread instead of rolls.    That's more te as style. The brisket was decent if a little dry.  BBQ sauces were thick and tasty and the hot one was super spicy.  I sampled lots of things on this visit - the chili, the pulled pork - both really good.   I'll come back for the chili.  For sides we tried Cole slaw - vinegratte and very fresh.  The cornbread was moist like pudding.  Baked beans were also god with pork inside.   I think I could eat Thanksgiving here. This small easy to miss BBQ spot gets packed for good reason.  Wood paneled walls, red white checkered table cloths provide a simple Texas decor.  Patio is big out back.  Happy hour was ridiculous with a really nice beer on draft for $4.  This place can accommodate a few large groups.  Inside or on the patio.","This tiny place with its red checkered plastic tableclothes and impromptu wood paneled bar top beer bar,  could almost be in Texas.Service is hands off in a Wild West New York style.  No forks maybe.  Ask for water.There were some late 20s people at the bar talking about either being vegetarian or cutting down on meat consumption.  The place was packed at 6:15 on a Sunday.A platter is 1/2 pound of meat with a side for around $15.  You could get that and share it.    I just ate the whole thing.As a Texan - the food is solid.  I got the brisket and fries.   I should have specified thin slice and not fatty,  but it was flavorful with very good house made sauces.   The fries also had a Texas feel - being crispy house cut not too thick. To eat such a filling quality meal for $15 in New York is a pretty good value.   The food is heavy so ask for lean cuts if you don't want to fall asleep immediately after eating. Food - better than average and good BBQ in NYC Atmosphere - small shack style place that is crowded but not too loud (no music).The counter service is hands off but fast.",I do apologize for the review.Overall it was good .I just think that the Mac and cheese needs some work .it is ALWAYS PACKED!!!!!!! I mean ALWAYS Brisket 10Ribs 8Collard greens 5Bake beans 5,John Brown Smokehouse
55,"Ended up having Szechuan cuisine for lunch today from Lucky Chen's in Flushing, Queens. Very underrated place, I thought the spices were really nice. Their fried shrimp & chicken dish as qell as their pork belly dish was excellent! Earqood mushrooms were dope, neber had it so flavorful before. This type of food is known to be spicy but it was at a level where I could even tolerate, just right. It's a shame more people dont eat here more often, I think the food is all around exceptional.","Service so bad , everyone is talk around front desk , tea pot was empty a little bit while , when we paid we had to go front desk get bill ,then I had to give back to the bill , horrible experience this time ..","Okish food can't survive in the competitive flushing. The best dish is the free pickle they offered at the beginning. The frog was the most disappointing dish ever. It's just spicy not yummy at all. Mapo tofu was mediocre, and fuqi feipian was mesiodre. We stepped in at lunch time but nobody was there. All the waiters were sitting together waiting.No wonder nobody was there except us.","This was a surprising find on my way home from running an errand in an area well outside of typical Flushing.Restaurant is very clean, food was good, and service is above what is typical in Flushing. Prices, food, and service are all more in line with similar restaurants in Manhattan but it's not as busy, leading to a more relaxed atmosphere that lets you enjoy the food and whatever company you have.","You don't need to be Lucky to find a good Szechuan restaurant. Lucky Chen checks all the boxes when it comes to delicious Szechuan cuisine. The place is decorated with simple and elegant interior appointments where chefs prepare hearty and spicy Szechuan numb tingling dishes. The level  of spiciness is perfectly tempered and balanced where you can actually taste and enjoy your meal without drowning in a pool of sweat cascading down your face.We had the following dishes that night:* Steamed baby cabbage with vermicelli - the sweetness of the cabbage absorbed by the vermicelli - very tasty.* Grilled Chiba tofu - My 1st time trying this tofu. Firm and quite tasty.* Chicken lo mein - typical lo mein taste* Shrimp in sweet chilli sauce - Huge shrimp and the sauce is finger licking good.* Grilled lamb chops - served with fried veggie egg rolls. The lamb was succulent and loved the subtle cumin on the chops.* Steamed chicken in chilli sauce - They deboned the chicken which made it easy to eat, loved the garlic and chilli sauce. * Sliced pork belly with veggies - rolled up and stuffed with veggies. Easy to eat and delicious as heck!* Thousand year old eggs with chillies - The yolk was smooth and creamy * Deep fried chicken with dry red chillies - Popcorn like chicken nuggets.* Fried buns with sweet condensed milk as a dipping sauce - Great finish to dinner as these were the perfect bite size morsels to wrap up your meal.The service could have been better. There was a bit of elapsed time between dishes and we had a little difficulty flagging our server down. As a whole the service staff was warm and friendly. Receive a free glass of wine or beer when you check in on your Yelp app, I did! :)  The restaurant is also giving upwards up to 10% off your bill if you write and post pics on your review on Yelp/Google. I would suggest you not to take this offer since your review may be biased. Listen Lucky Chen your food is more than good enough to earn a favorable rating. My recommendation is to get rid of this promotion. Finding a Parking space is a challenge. Go early to look for a spot. Major credit cards are accepted Great and reasonable priced Szechuan deliciousness in Flushing. It dosen't get better than that!","Another good option to consider in flushing if you're looking for new places to try, lots of space so great for large groups. Kids friendly and their dishes are good for sharing, friendly staff too! I recommend ordering a bunch of dishes to try if you're here with a group, we got some pork dishes that were really yummy, don't remember the name so check the pics! the stir fry dishes are good too.Here are some dishes we tried:Sliced Pork with Garlic Sauce - this is goodsome mushroom & chicken potSauteed Beef Fillet with Mixed Pepper Steamed Chicken with Chili SauceMixed Herbal Chicken Soup Deep-Fried Chicken Stir-Fried Loofah, Yam and Fungus Sauteed Spare Ribs with Baby PotatoesSichuan Boiled Fish with Bone - skippable(not the full list but from what I can remember!)They give a 5% discount for writing a review and another 5% for uploading photos :) so why not! I'll be back to try some other dishes and maybe lunch specials next time!",Lucky Chen - 五锦轩
56,"Visiting NY from California and I got to say I wish we had this back home! The quality, authenticity, and juiciness of the breakfast is far beyond than what I could of imagined. I will miss you.","Fantastic food. Offensive prices.The regular menu is reasonably priced, but the brunch menu is obscene. It's highway (30th Avenue) robbery for a business that doesn't pay rent to charge so much.",And they make their own sausage. You can taste it! Summers and breakfast....can't wait!,"After living in multiple cities along the East Coast, I always love stumbling upon food trucks. They are quick, easy, simple and affordable. Well this particular one, situated just a block from the 30th Avenue Subway stop in Astoria is seamless. Present almost every day of the week, they offer fresh ingredients (including many vegan options) that can easily be customized. For example, I ordered an egg white omelette with mushroom, peppers, cheese and vegan seitan sausage on a croissant. Who does that!? More importantly, they CAN do it, and do it well to say the least.. Their portion sizes aren't particularly huge but certainly enough to keep you full for the time being. Staff are also extremely pleasant. Always smiling no matter how early in the AM and always offering samples with their freshly made sauces. You can tell they're thrilled to be a part of this establishment and why wouldn't they - situated right in the heart of a busy, eclectic, multicultural neighborhood like Astoria. Definitely check it out, you will not be disappointed.",This is the place to on a weekend morning ! They truly never disappoint. Every meal we have ever had from here has been absolutely delicious. The crew is always down to help you decide what meal to choose and beyond helpful and sweet. Oh and their desserts OMG to die for !They really are amazing all around. Our kids are even fans !One thing is definitely expect a line but I promise you it's worth it !,"Great food, picture tells the amazing story, worth the travel worth the price for this healthy breakfast,Great food guys, I have not eating this healthy for a while, lucky I found this location cause shits amazing ;). Great . Now I'm gonna go and pig up this delicious breakfast!",The Breakfast Shack
57,"This is a quaint little bistro in the middle of a busy neighborhood.  French cuisine!  We had the snail brusetta as an appetizer.   Then we had our main course.  Pot of seafood, braised beef, chicken croquettes....  very filling","We made reservations upon a high recommendation from a friend. The place is small and quaint. Service was attentive. Food was as good as expected. Foie gras and red/yellow beets goats cheese appetizers. Beef Bourgogne and chicken cordon bleu as entrees. Chocolate soufflé dessert along with #4 dessert(can't remember the name) which was delicious. Everything was amazing including the glass of bubbles to start with and the bottle of burgundy with dinner. The only complaint I have, and is the reason why I didn't give 5stars is, the only thing we didn't finish eating was half of my beef Bourgogne. I asked our waiter to please take it to go. And I noted to my husband there were 2 hefty size bits of beef we could bring home and our son could get a taste. When we got home and opened it, there was only 1 piece of beef and the rest was carrots, mushrooms and pearl onions. I actually thought the to-go-bag felt lighter than what I thought it should've been.  I hate to complain but to skim off a customer's plate which they've asked to take the rest of their meal to go is really the low of low for a restaurant and its employees.","Hit or miss. Not consistent. And I get it is French, but some of their items taste weird. Wouldn't go there for their Maman Burger- had a weird taste from the Brie?  I order the steak, but even that is pretty inconsistent. I went there for the steak because I like that cut, and Dog and Duck closed to something not nearly as good. Maybe I'll try French cuisine then. As it's a French spot.","It was a rainy Thursday evening; 7 of us dined here for an early birthday celebration for myself and Jeannie T.  Thanks to Jeannie T for arranging this spectacular dinner and introducing me to Cote Soleil!  What a hidden neighborhood gem!  I had no idea this place even existed.  But, I will definitely be back!This restaurant is small in size but there is nothing small about my experience here!  Great ambiance, great music, great service; we were transported to a little bistro in the middle of a quaint neighborhood in Paris.  Our waiter, David, (with his charming accent), was just wonderful, and really took care of us.  We were 6 Yelp Elites and 1 non-yelper (imagine that lol), so this meant some serious eats, for sure!  What a FEAST we had!!We started off with ""a few"" appetizers:- Baked Brie w.honey- Foie Gras w.toasted brioche & jam- Escargot w.butter garlic (ohhhh, that butter!! Great for bread dipping!)- Flatbread pizza w.truffle oil- Beef tartar w.french fries, salad and toast **(The pizza and beef tartar were entrees, which we shared as appetizers).These ""few"" appetizers were all outstanding and the highlight of my meal. My faves were the truffle flatbread pizza and escargot, but really, each dish really stood out on its own.  Just fabulous. I was stuffed after all those appetizers but like a true Elite Yelper, I just had to carry on! haha  Ok, onto the entrees! Surprisingly, all 7 of us happened to pick different entrees!  Entrees:- Le Cordon Bleu: Breaded chicken stuffed with ham and Swiss, served with mashed potatoes, green beans and blue cheese sauce.- Le Boeuf Bourguignon: Slowly braised beef in red wine sauce with mushrooms and bacon, served with mashed potatoes.- Le Baguez: Lamb sausage, fries and Harissa mayo in baguette.- Truffle Lobster Mac and Cheese: Elbow pasta with lobster and Swiss cheese with truffle sauce.- Les Ris de Veau sauce forestiere: Pan seared Veal sweetbread with mushroom sauce and rice.- La Bouillabaisse: provencal fish stew (cod fish, mussels & shrimp in a fish broth; w.fingerling potatoes & braised fennel).- Le Cabillaud au Champagne et Pommes de Terre Nouvelles: Pan seared codfish with champagne sauce, spinach and roasted fingerling potatoes.I had Le Cabillaud au Champagne, and it was delicious.  Although the cod fish was a littler more well-done than I personally prefer, it was still good; the sauce was delicious; the spinach and roasted potatoes were perfection.  I can't speak about the other entrees, as i didn't try any of it, but everyone seemed to enjoy their chosen dish.  Portion sizes for each dish were large!  After all those wonderful appetizers, most of us couldn't finish our entrees, and ended up bring home leftovers.  David, our charming waiter, packed our leftovers and even wrote us all personal notes - so sweet! We were all so stuffed that we didn't have room for dessert!  Next time, we will leave room, as their desserts all sounded very tempting.  What a great evening, with great company and delicious food!  A wonderful way to start the early birthday celebrations!  I look forward to many returns to Cote Soleil...there are many more dishes I'd love to try!  :)","Milestone 700th review! (200th review for Cote Soleil if I timed this right.)Being born and raised in Queens I always loved this section of Skillman avenue in what is technically Woodside, but I always considered this Sunnyside. It seems that this area's popularity has grown since it has become much more difficult to park. Cote Soleil is a beautiful neighborhood gem that I would dine in weekly if I lived nearby.The space is small and the kitchen area large. It is nicely decorated with a classic comfortable French feel and music in the background. The service is some of the very best I've ever experienced - so warm and friendly. All the food here made me giddily happy because it is just so damn good!La Friand Au Brie - baked brie with honey is perhaps my favorite app from here. That cheese is so rich and decadent along with the crispy baked outside - SO GOOD!La terrine de foie gras - personally not a big foie gras fan, but fellow diners love this dish.Les Escargots Au Beurre Persille - I didn't eat the snails (rather have others try this), but you know I was dipping into that garlic butter!La Tartare De Boeuf Au Couteau we did as an appetizer since we were a large group of 7. It was so good and rich with a nice brightness to the raw beef.La Pizza A La Truffe - yes pizza - there was no tomato sauce just excellent cheese and truffle flavor on top of a crisp crust. Get this and be happy.After the ridiculous amount of excellent apps I was nearly full, but still ordered the Bouillabaisse as my entree. I did not regret this. It was a large satisfy bowl on a cold rainy night. Large piece of cod in the center surrounded by mussels and jumbo shrimp (peel on so dive in a make mess of yourself - it is worth it!). I loved the braised fennel in this and that creamy broth was so good. I also tried the Mac N' Cheese truffes au homard which was also amazingly good! large chunks of lobster and the cheese had an incredible seafood and truffle flavor. The wine list is very reasonably priced we had a nice Cotes du Rhone that was fantastic. Others had the sangria and they even make fresh lemonade for non-alcohol drinkers.","i love this place! such a cute little place in woodside that has the best service and amazing food. i have been here for weekend brunch a few times now and always get the same few things. the best part is that it always. comes. out. the. same. they are VERY consistent and you can tell they put the time and effort into their food. i think they do take a couple extra minutes to get your food out sometimes- but i'd rather that and have it taste delicious than obviously rushed. oh, not the mention, you would not be breaking the bank here. must tries: ham cheese and egg crepe, nutella french toast, croque madame, smoked salmon crepe. we've also had the burger and the lamb baguette sandwich. all of the above come with fries or side salad. the fries are to die for! they a thicker cut and crusted with flour or something so have that extra coated crisp. sooooo good and satisfying. tip: starts to get pretty busy around 10-10:30 but dies back down at 1 or 2.. but still worth the wait if you have to!",Côté Soleil
58,"Noodle is too soft . Soup taste just normal can't compare Traditional.  Wonton is big but taste can't said full score. Beef stew I only give two stars.  Basic on the price and food taste, I don't think will go again.","Love the food over here, no regret driving all the way from Brooklyn to Flushing for noodle and fired fish skin and noodle.I would say the dumpling is the top 3 in New York City.And that can beat so many noodle soup in Hong Kong.",Must try their dumplings ! 5 stars   Order their fried fish skin and add into soup noodle and don't forget to use their homemade chili oil.,"100!I've been looking forward to coming here ever since the original pop-up opened and this place did not disappoint!!I ordered the Noodle Soup with wontons, dumplings and beef stew.  My table also ordered an appetizer of fried fish skin and a veggie side of lettuce topped with ja jiang (pork with sweet and spicy sauce). Of course the wontons were huge and filled with delicious shrimp but the dumplings were AMAZING!  We ordered some frozen ones to take home with us.  Also, don't sleep on the beef stew topping.  It is a game changer!!","Maxi's Noodle (雲吞妹; literally, 'Wonton Little Sister') is a Hong Kong-style wonton noodle shop that recently moved to Downtown Flushing, to a small space on 38th Avenue. There are approximately 9 two-seater tables that are configurable in a few ways. There is some bench seating available along the walls, otherwise seating is on red plastic stools. Having been to the new space twice in two weeks, I would say that Maxi's Noodle has done a good job acclimating to its new location and customer volume. Their wontons and dumplings are still the best in Queens, and their noodles are back to being great, too.Our favorite order to get is the egg noodles with three add-ons: beef stew, wonton, and dumplings. The fried fish skins, which sound unappetizing on name alone, are actually pretty good. The fish skins are fried to an airy crisp, and retain their crispiness when dunked in soup to add more flavor. Maxi's own chili oil is amazing; it's also available separately for sale at $6 per jar.","Maxi's Noodle (雲吞妹; literally, 'Wonton Little Sister') is a wonton noodle pop-up shop, currently hosted in the evenings at Kissena Café, except on Thursdays. Maxi's will be moving into their own location in Downtown Flushing in the short term (maybe a month or two) -- check their website or social media for the latest information on their move. Kissena Café is a small venue, with four tables of four seats, but one shouldn't encounter a problem with seating as it seems that most people order out. The café does not have a customer accessible bathroom.I think Maxi's Noodle has the best Hong Kong style wontons and dumplings in Queens, NY. Dishes We've Had:- Beef Stew Lo Mein (actually, Beef Brisket Lo Mein; 牛腩捞麵), with wontons (雲吞) and egg noodles(蛋麵): This is a superb noodle bowl for only $10. The egg noodles are bouncy and chewy, the wontons are substantive and made with fresh shrimp, and the beef brisket is excellent. The bowl also contains beef tendon, which I'm not a fan of, but I'm told this is well-executed, too. The dish comes with soup, but I find the included beef stew sauce to provide such excellent flavor that the soup is not needed.- Frozen Wontons and Frozen Dumplings (take-out): The wontons and dumplings are here large and substantive, made with fresh ingredients. Travel Logistics:- Four MTA bus routes are near Maxi's Noodles. 1-hour metered parking is available on Kissena Boulevard, and it is possible to find free parking along the side streets.",Maxi’s Noodle
59,Service and entertainment was great however the food was just overpriced and severely missing flavor. Extremely disappointed I spent $60 for food that I should have been getting payed to eat.,"The food and service is good.. beautiful spot ...only issue I had was how cold it was inside..the weather wasn't terribly hot outside, but the AC was cranked to high. I spoke to one of the staff members and he told me their not able to control itI really couldn't enjoy my food, as much as I wanted too.. and the end result is that so caught a coldThey should really invest in having a repair AC company come in and fix this issue.....","This place has good food and good service. I've never really had to wait for long if I didn't have a reservation, already. The only negative thing is they have a few signature drinks, one of which my boyfriend and I love, but every time we come in to get it, they don't have one of the ingredients for it. We've been there 4 or 5 times throughout the last 12 months or so and we only had this drink back in August of '18. Every time since then, ""we're out of blue curacao..."" A little disappointing since it's 1 of maybe 6 signature drinks.","Sabor de Cuba is a really nice Cuban restaurant in Astoria.  It's well decorated with kitsch Cuban stuff.  Menus come in Cuban cigar boxes, the drink menu comes pasted on a bottle.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The food was all good.  The garlic shrimp was actually pretty amazing, and one of the best I've had.  The ceviche (I know, not really the most Cuban thing I could've had) was great, too.  Highly recommended!","I'm now a regular at Sabor De Cuba. What can I say I just love everything about this establishment from the beautiful decor, to their menu creativity, friendly staff, good drinks and their DELICIOUS food. At my most recent visit, a friend and I happened to meet the owner Sandra who is so delightful. I appreciate that she is an owner who is really involved and hands on with her team. We were also provided a catering menu since my friend and I are looking to have a catered event soon. We tried the seafood paella this past visit and that too was good. My Top (favorite) recommendations: Salmon a la Parilla & seafood paella. Calarmi too. Drink recommendations: Sanjitos of any flavor.","Wow I came here again and I must say the food touches your soul! I had the Salmon A La Parilla and it's probably the best tasting meal I had in a very long time. It was so flavorful I would definitely order again and can't wait to come again. The salmon wasn't dry, the asparagus was grilled topped with roasted red pepper sauce, and cassava purée was the highlight. My friend had steak and said it was very good. When I first came here I gave this place 4 stars based off of a Friday lunch special and the service of Jose (who is phenomenal and only want to be served by him). So now I have to give this place 5 stars since the meal was excellent and Jose remained consistent. Also we came during happy hour,  in which the drinks like sangria, sanjitos, the list can go on but they were 2 for $10 what's there not to like about this place??? Definitely a gem of Astoria, my new favorite place.",Sabor De Cuba
60,"Came here on a whim for the first time. The place itself is really cute and inviting but the food and drinks are a different story. Iced coffee was terrible. Had meatballs as the appetizer, honestly subpar. Had the rigatoni carbonara as the main entrée- wasn't it impressed at all. It was tasteless and dry. Wouldn't recommend. Tons of other options in Astoria.","I came here with my siblings for brunch and honestly it was not good. I had the pasta which lacked any flavor at all. I was very unimpressed and only ate a few bites. The omelette as you can see from the photo was pretty dry. The best part of the food we ordered was probably the chicken and waffles and the potatoes that came on the side of the omelette. It was pretty disappointing to say the least. The decor is very nice but people come for the food mostly so unfortunately, my siblings and I will not be back here again. Food: 2/5 Ambience: 4/5Service: 3/5","ok, ok, i'll stop reviewing them. i love their look, floor to ceiling windows, outdoor seating. but can't get a good meal here to save my life. i had the crispy gnocchi, no flavor at all, just couldn't believe what i was eating and the portion size was very small for a pasta dish. not looking for an overflowing bowl, especially of gnocchi, but it looked like someone's leftovers. can't remember what the bf had.almost forgot, waiter was new and so rough around the edges, it was uncomfortable.maybe i should try them for brunch, hard to mess up eggs!","I really enjoyed my experience at Gastroteca. The service was excellent, and the food was very good. Their menu is great, I recommend ordering a bunch of plates and sharing. The portions are pretty large too!For the appetizers I had the stacked crispy eggplant which was almost like a eggplant parm tower. It was huge and really good. I also had the kale caesar. For dinner their crispy gnocchi was fantastic, and for a protein kick, the cotoletta was a massive piece of veal which was also delicious.They have a great drink menu. I had an aperol spritz (obvi) and a cider. Would love to try this place for brunch!","Nice, pretty place with decent options. Beautiful decor and super-friendly staff in this floor-to-ceiling window, corner shop type of ristorante. I've tried a few things from here but what stands out the most is how well seasoned their chicken and beef are. Pretty tasty salad options and decent liquor selection.","Gastroteca Astoria is a very pleasant Italian restaurant in Astoria with simply okay Italian food. The space itself is great however, and service was friendly and efficient, too, and that's why my rating is boosted from three to four stars.  The food, as mentioned though, is simply okay.  The pasta wasn't al dente and every dish was very over salted.  I love salty food and can't recall even complaining about this on any recent occasion.  But this was salty nearly to the point of being ruined.  One dish however was excellent- the baked clams.  And overall, the prices weren't exorbitantly high either.  So, combining the beautiful space with such great service, along with decent prices and some delicious baked clams, I'm willing to return and assume I came on an off night.",Gastroteca
61,"Decent Taiwanese food, but closes too often to be reliable.They are closed for entire month of August.","I brought my family here because of all the reviews that raved about how sweet the owner is. Food is good. Just like other reviewers say, she had already run out of some dishes on the menu. Also it's cash only. Owner was very unprofessional and rude to our family. For 5 adults and 1 baby we ordered 4 dishes. Halfway through we knew we couldn't finish the food so asked for the rest to be wrapped up so we could bring it home. She got upset and yelled at us, told us that if she had known we were going to do that, that she would've ""kicked"" us out. In all the places we've eaten around NYC, this was the first time I experienced such a disrespectful and rude owner. Very disappointing. Will never come here again.","My wife and I have been here numerous times either for take-out or dining in and Mama Lee and her husband (chef) never disappoints. It is the best home cooked Taiwanese food I have ever eaten and there isn't anything on the menu I dislike. You can tell a lot of time and effort is put into the cooking and Mama Lee always looks out for her customers to ensure satisfaction.Some may argue that the price range is a tad expensive only because tip and service is built into the menu pricing. Overall, you are paying for flavorful food and the quality of service.For the reviews before me, I think it is a bit unfair to give such low ratings based on her business hours and rude attitude. Although, I understand that these are key elements in running a good business, sometimes you just have to wonder maybe that person might be going through something. She lost her main chef in recent months, so she is under a lot of pressure in running the restaurant alone with her husband. She has also been working for a while and I wouldn't blame her if she needs a well deserved break.","Excellent taiwanese food with a very homey feel. The restaurant is ""mama-owned"" and she runs it just like her home. She's super friendly and inviting, and treats you like a visiting guest within her home. I remember I had gone once with a friend and we ordered a ton of food and we couldn't finish it. She was so amused because she had told us beforehand that it would be too much. And when I asked for her to pack it up, she ended up throwing in more food into our box! An extra egg and some more rice/pork. Super nice woman!The food is excellent. I always get the minced pork over rice just because it's a staple and she makes it very well. The other stuff like the jajamyun is also awesome. The taste and atmosphere is second to none. Love this place.","3.5 starsTo start, mama lee's meatball dish is delicious. There's really no debate over that. That's a 5 star dish. You should come just to eat that. She serves you chicken soup while you wait and refills your rice whenever you want. The issue is the service. There are some negative reviews here about that and they're not wrong. You have to be in this mindset that you're going to your really annoying and condescending aunt's house for dinner. This is the kind of aunt that will tell you that you gained weight and you probably shouldn't eat that. Your aunt knows better than you. You roll your eyes and get through dinner. That's mama lee and she knows you better than you know yourself. Also, call before you go because she will close for random reasons, like she's away for vacation the entire month or she has allergies today, etc.","The food is great, if you can get it.  The meatballs were my favorite, the fried chicken was my son's favorite.Be very careful about depending too much on this place.  There are only about 6 small tables, and even that overwhelms this restaurant.Mama Lee actually started turning away other diners after about 4 of these tables were filled because she ""ran out of dishes"".  A lot of people left disappointed.Assume that if you show up during prime dining hours there's a better than 50% chance that you won't be eating anytime soon.",Mama Lee
62,"Great overall vibe, tasty and well-plated food. The Bartender at the bar during the weekend brunch never smiled-and barely spoke to anyone!They make a very spicy House Bloody Mary!","I had a very bad experience here. I went there a group of five. I could be seated right away, even though the restaurant is so busy. That's nice. We ordered food from the menu, but the waiter said that's the wrong menu so we don't have any of those. And take the wrong menu and walk away. And he didn't come back for 20 mins until I asked him to come. He said, currently there is private party here, so it's very busy. I don't care there is private party or not!! If you can't handle it, don't let new customers inside!! And he went to another table to take a order. It seems like, called him ""Sir"" offended him... that's hilarious... After 30 mins of staying we just got coffee... so we left the restaurant because it seems like we were unwelcome customers. Good thing was they didn't charge for the coffee when I offered them to pay the bill...",The atmosphere is fun but the food and drinks were tasteless and not worth the price. My friend had to change drinks and it was still dull and the food had no taste.,"Let me start off by saying The Bonnie is an amazing restaurant and bar for any occasion. Whether it's grabbing a drink with a friend or planning a surprise birthday party it's a well rounded establishment for all plans. The food was excellent and they have some interesting options on the menu and something for everyone. I loved the Mac and Cheese and fried pickles. The atmosphere is relaxing and fun at the same time. They have 2 bars and curbside seating as well as a back patio beautifully set up for group parties or hangouts. The cocktails are tasty and fairly priced and there were no complaints with the service as everyone was attentive and very friendly.I had my girlfriends surprise birthday party here and everything went perfect. Great location from the train and in a nice area of Astoria. The food, bar service and set up was spot on. All the guests had so much fun and their event planner (Kate) was helpful and had all the concerns and bases covered. During the entire event herself and the staff were on top of every detail. They stored our birthday cake and brought it out at the right time and even added candies! We had about 20 people attend and the food and open bar was a big hit. I recommend if you're considering this place for any event, DO IT!","The Bonnie has been on my to-go list for a while, and maybe that's why I was soooo disappointed after my visit.Came here to meet a date who lives in Astoria. Perfect circumstances, we're keeping it local and trying a place I had been wanting to go-to for a while.The Bonnie is great with ample seating outside, bar and table seating inside, and even more space in the back. I didn't explore too much, but the decor and size of the place were great. Surprisingly, it wasn't as busy as I expected it to be.Service was fine. Seems like this is the type of place where frequent patrons will be treated extra well, which I think is reasonable and good for business.Offerings are familiar and reasonably priced. For the date, we kept it to just drinks. None of the cocktails stood out to me, but that's all a matter of personal choice. I enjoyed a bell's two hearted ale.I was hoping to eat, but since we were keeping it to just cocktails, I pulled a fast one and doubled back after departing. I can't not order chicken and waffles when I see it on a menu. But here's where the disappointment set in. The waffle part of the chicken and waffles was lovely. The chicken part of it though was just some bland jumbo chicken finger. Like... what?! My heart sank. I was hella hungry and had been eager to come here for a while hearing that their food was awesome. They really hit me off with some jumbo chicken finger though. Worse was that it was bland bland. I had to throw a lot of hot sauce on it just assuage my sadness.It was a little frustrating to leave like that and tbh, it wouldn't be enough for me to give the Bonnie a 2-star review, but when I noticed that they're charging $7 for a Narragansett?! Come on, $7?! I'm not trying to cast aspersions on Narragansett, but it's half a step up from PBR. It's what you drink when you don't want to drink, but don't want water.I love the locale and the place; the people are nice and attentive. I wanna believe that the rest of their menu is actually awesome, as described to me by other folks, but I can't see myself taking a trip out to the Bonnie again. There are other places to drink. There is better food out there.","Great neighborhood spot with well-curated menu for brunch and dinner. Beers and cocktails available always are interesting too. Mix of seating/rooms provides something for everyone, even outdoors in the back.",The Bonnie
63,"Only came here to grab drinks with some friends.  The drinks were horrendously overpriced for Queens (especially in the area that this place is in).Atmosphere is really cool, BUT this is not Manhattan - don't charge Manhattan drink prices!","My girlfriend raves about Mito as her favorite local Japanese spot and I couldn't agree more!They've got decent happy hour deals with a small discount on most of their sushi rolls. We ordered a mixture of appetizers and sushi: rock shrimp, crab rangoon, salmon skin roll, salmon avocado roll, and spicy salmon roll.The standout was the rock shrimp! Crispy battered shrimp with a mayo sauce on a bed of lettuce. Great taste to the seasoned batter and sauce.No problems with everything else, quite standard fare and definitely noticeably higher quality ingredients than other local spots in the area but the spicy salmon wasn't really spicy at all.Service was decent, was quite empty at the time we were there because it was the awkward time between lunch and dinner so the wait staff were mostly off to the side so it took a while for them to notice whenever we needed things.",Short review tried ordering online was presenting it an error tried ordering over the phone was hoping they would honor the 10% Discount no big deal they didnt next I live 3 blocks away took 50+ minutes. Overall the rolls were good but the $7+tax kani salad was not worth the price. C+,"My husband and I went to Sushi Yasu on Austin street and spent $250 on terrible omakase.We decided to try a new FH sushi spot and picked Mito for their good reviews.Wow, really just wow. We spent $120 on an 18 piece sashimi platter, rapunzel hair special roll, triple 3 special roll, a hot mama special roll and a bottle of nigori sake. More than enough food and alcohol for 2 people and on top of that, way BETTER FLAVOR, BETTER TEXTURE, MORE FRESH than our sushi Yasu omakase! We went back tonight and instead of the sashimi platter with our rolls, we got the yellowtail platter. Husband & I rated it 8/10 & def would recommend if you're a yellowtail fan.Still highly recommend the hot mama, triple 3 and rapunzel hair!!! Mito chef's are generous with the amount of fish and avocado they give, without too much rice on the rolls. Servers are very attentive, always polite. Love how they're always gracefully presenting our plates in front of you (similar to omakase) and tell you what each thing is (try to sit at the wall booths!) The service is great. Presentation is on point. Ambiance decor is great for a fancy date night but a casual after work spot too.Although they are located off the bustling Austin Street, trekking to Mito is worth. Def check out if you're in Forest Hills looking for good sushi!","Really great find, especially for a birthday celebration. The people here are friendly and attentive. Ambience was lovely. The space is large and wasn't crowded on a Wednesday night that I attended. Plenty of seating and bathrooms are very clean! Food was excellent as well. We ordered a lot of sushi. I got the monster lobster which I think is well worth the price and a roll you must try! I had a taste of the general tso chicken and it was also great. Sushi and the rest of the food was very fresh. Also the food came out in a decent amount of time. Overall highly recommend! Prices are average. They also have lunch specials!","Never knew this place existed so close to my house. What a great find! You can get all your Asian food cravings satisfied here, literally all Asian foods. Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese and more I'm sure I didn't see.I ordered the Mongolian beef and some sushi rolls. Sushi was fresh and exactly how sushi should be. Although sushi prices in BK are still king. The beef tender, however the brown rice was a bit on the dry and raw side. Nonetheless, I can see myself coming back for a dinner in the very near future.",Mito Asian Fusion
64,"This is one of my weekend breakfast joint, which I rotate.  Unbeknown to me I arrived 6 minutes before opening time.  7:54 am.  I saw a Latino female waitress, which is not the European blonde hair one Who works most Sunday morning.  We pushed the door and it was locked.  I peeped in via the glass.  She just looked at me and ignored us.  It will not kill her to let is in to sit down, and she can start serving us from 8 am. This can write us off and I am not spending my money on crap customer service.  The photos you saw here are from previous visits. I ended up somewhere else.",Unfortunately both entrees missed the mark. My tuna was undercooked and tomatoes were mushy. My husbands hanger steak was fatty and chewy. Mushed potatoes were nice. Service was nice. Tables are close to each other.,"Really don't understand the hype (and crowds) around Cafe Henri. It's a solid french place serving up overpriced crepes and costco-esque croissants for weekend brunch. If you're going for crepes, you're better off going a little further to Cafe Triskell in astoria/licThe classic croque monsieur and madame seem very overpriced for what you actually get (two slices of bread, a slice or two of ham and some melted cheese, with a little handful of mixed greens). They must make a killing on these margins! French onion soup is a small cup of liquid with some onions and melted cheese. Wasn't impressed but would say it was pretty standard. I've had much much better at many other french places in this city. Overally not my favorite place in LIC, not even my favorite french place in LIC (that would be Tournesol across the street).",This place is adorable! I love love love it. We came here after a cold October night to sip on cappuccinos/get dessert. We got the chocolate bread pudding and omg it was soooo good. The place is also affordable. Service was great too! Very family friendly. There were like two other families sitting eating dinner. They're also very accommodating with the stroller. I went to two other restaurants in LIC and they were blatant about being unable to fit us because I had a stroller and my baby was asleep...The atmosphere was cozy and warm. We really enjoyed our time.,"One of my fiancé's favorite places to go. She loves the French esthetic and ambiance. It's a small little cozy place with delicious food. We've been here several times and trust me when I say everything on the menu is delicious. Cafe Henri is always consistent with great food, on spot service and we love the decor. I'll take wooden tables and floors to modern restaurants any day. Also, we have been fortunate to avoid the lines, but take it as a warning. By no means make Cafe Henri your Saturday brunch choice. I envision it as a cute Sunday brunch to just relax and be cozy. Let Cafe Henri get you ready for the work week ahead =)","Went to cafe Henri for dessert with my friends after eating out at another restaurant in the area. We had the cafe mocha for drink and shared dessert. The cafe mocha was made well, not the best I've had but pretty solid.For dessert we had the creme brulee and the croissant cake(forget the exact name). Creme brulee was solid on the top and nice and creamy on the inside. The addition of fresh strawberry slices was great and really added a nice touch to the dessert.The croissant cake type dessert was rich and creamy and also delicious. Kind of had something like a bread pudding texture on the inside,  I enjoyed.Overall if I am in the area again I would try more of the menu. Service was good and definitely not rushed. Tip this is a great dessert spot during the week at night,  restaurant was empty around 9:30 so it's easier to talk and relax!",Café Henri
65,Insane place. Would never recommend.My family came here for lunch. We waited 10 minutes for water. The place was packed and the servers were incredibly rude.My family ordered salads and hummus. So we thought it wouldn't take too long. The wait was long. And in the middle of our meal they blasted the A/C on high (right over our table) blowing tons of hair and dirt in my food. We complained to 3 different members of the wait staff. No one would turn the A/C off. So continuous dirt and hair ended up on our table and in our food.Insane. And very poor service.,Fairly disappointed. We ordered take out - the chicken shish kebab and babaganoush. It just was so dry and underwhelming as a meal.Not sure we will be back.,Food is always fresh and amazing... Their pita and hummus are authentic and I am never disappointed!!Great service,"I was so pleasantly surprised by this gem and issue a strong recommendation to go.   The lentil soup with a squeeze of lemon was simply delicious!   The eggplant was bright and flavorful with the red pepper accent.    My Kofta pita was perfect and authentic.    All in all, it was delicious and promptly served. I could taste the pride of the cook.   The bread was authentic too with perfect char.   Ask for olive oil and it comes with herbs and  olives.   I was very surprised to only see a 3.5 star rating - it deserves higher.   Maybe it was the service- had to ask for a few things a few times but it didn't matter.  The food spoke for itself.    It's inexpensive-- 2 appetizers and two substantial pitas and baklava for dessert- $40.    Not bad in nyc.    Go!","I seldom visit Forest Hills but when I do, I love to try new places to eat. I was disappointed I chose Oba. My calamari didn't have flavor but it was crispy! My adana chicken was so hard you would double check if it was ground chicken! The waiter spilled water when refilling my water. The other water guy spilled water on the floor u knowingly wetting 3 costumer legs including mine. The lady next to me returned her fries because they tasted old. Not good. Try a different place. The best thing - bathroom is clean  and large.","We go here about 2-3 times a week. So much so that we should be getting an employee discount!! LOL. Yesterday we popped in and it was BUSY! We had to wait for a table but given that we are completely in love with Oba it was worth the wait.Deniz was our server again as she has been several times before. She rocks. Seriously she knows her sh*t. When she comes to take your order, she never writes anything down. (me being a server knows that sometimes that can be tricky)Our food comes out so fresh and delicious. We shared a falafel appetizer and an order of piyaz. The falafel comes out nice and warm and the hummus (they make in house) has a delicate texture that spreads well on the falafel. The piyaz was delicious. Those two dishes plus the warm bread they bring you, in the beginning, filled us up!If you are in search of some delicious Turkish food, and an excellent service stop by Oba. You will not be disappointed in either.",OBA Mediterranean Gyro & Grill
66,"Flying sidekick soup dumplings! Thin skin, hot flavorful soup and porky stuffing. Just kill me now.My daughter sez, if I only have one more meal left on earth it'll be soup dumplings.Also ordered beef noodle soup and pan fried noodles (shredded pork I think).Very good Shanghai style food at reasonable prices with generous portions.Cash only, FYI. Also parking is difficult.","Decided to give Kung Fu Xiao Long bao a try after Nan Xiang closed down in Flushing. This place was first ""hyped"" up by business insider with the video about their chocolate XLBs. This place was smaller than I thought but still fits a decent amount of people. The menus are also all faded, I could barely read it so I had to go on yelp and find a menu that wasn't faded. My boyfriend and I were starving as it was our first meal of the day. We quickly ordered the crab XLB, regular pork XLB, rice cakes, and spicy wontons.crab XLB - This was SO meh. It wasn't good. There was absolutely no pork flavor or any flavor at all.Crab XLB - This one was better as the crab taste was there.Rice cakes - With meat & veggies. It was way too salty for me.Spicy Wontons - I was kind of expecting wontons like white bear in flushing but it was kind of weird. A small portion for a large price point. Chilli oil wasn't fragrant at all and on top of that, there was a sesame/peanut sauce on top that was unexpected.Overall, this place is very meh. I didn't want to try the chocolate XLB as that didn't seem appetizing to me and with the quality of the food that i had, I most deff wasn't going to try it. I'm not sure why this place is so hyped. Also, this place is hard to get to for me and the prices were more than the flushing shanghai restaurants.","This may not be a fair review for this establishment but the 1 star is for the owners/management of Kung Fu Xiao Long Bao know that Yelp ordering or delivery.com isn't the most reliable services. Are you reading this? Hope I got your attention.I placed the order at 10:30 and got confirmation that my order will be ready at 11:15. Got there at 11:20 and was told they did not receive the order. Came to find out that Yelp/delivery.com never sent them the order. I called the number that Yelp provided and the person I spoke to was rude and only said they're faxing over that order now, at 11:22. This won't be my last time coming here but it's definitely left a bad taste in my mouth for such poor service. Definitely NOT reliable.You're better off either going in person or call to order. Yelp, I expected better from you. Very disappointed.",This is probably the best soup dumplings I have ever had.  They were pillowy on the outside and bursting with flavor on the inside.  Do yourself a favor and use the vinegar they put on am the table. I also had the pork belly with quail eggs and rice.  Pork was rendered perfectly and the broth had so much flavor.  The only wish I had was that TBD eggs were soft boiled. We were a party of 9 and we were seated quickly and food came out fast.  Next time im in Flushing I'm def coming by,"My friend and I came all the way out to Flushing for some good XLB and were not disappointed! (Note: this place is cash only.)Kung Fu XLB:  Probably the best ones I've had in NYC. They're thin but don't break easily when you pick them up (this has happened to me so many times, it's a tragedy). They're also pretty reasonably priced, at 6 for $8. Sweet soy milk: Hard to go wrong with this. I had the cold one and it was good, although a little sweeter than I'm used to.Salted soy bean curd: This was a touch too salty for me, but still good.Fried bun with chives & egg: I loved these! The chive filling is really fresh, and the buns are crispy without being too oily.Stir-fried eggplant and green beans: We got this as our obligatory vegetable dish, but I was honestly surprised by how good it was! Well seasoned and not too oily.Service was great as well. Will definitely be making the hourlong trip again!","They're definitely pricey all around. $11.95 for shanghai pan fried noodles with maybe 2 bokchoys they slice down into 8th, and a few slivers of pork. While tasty, hefty price tag considering how small the portion is.But the main event, 6 soup dumplings for about $8 is not tooo bad considering they are the thinnest and most delicate ones I've seen besides the big DTF chain. Their crab one is superior to their pork one flavor wise for sure. I've tried the loofah one, meh. If you just eat the crab ones, and I mean several baskets of them throw in a niu rou mien if you're extra hungry then you're good to go. Yeah their mapo dofu is pretty good, but so $$$ for what it is. Their beef roll ups are a bit of a bore, too. Cash only- buy why? Cause their prices are still high.",Kung Fu Xiao Long Bao
67,The food was bomb. The steamed dumplings were A1! And the wings were good. Also I'd reorder the rice cake appetizer thing. It was bomb!!I wouldn't reorder the chicken stew diner thing. My bf liked it tho.,"Can't believe this place has 5 star reviews. We came here because of the good yelp reviews. We had japchae, spicy pork, and bibimbop. The food was TOO salty and too much of msg taste. I ended of not being able to eat most of it. Just make a trip to ktown or flushing.Overall, we will never return again.","The food is really really salty, I had to eat it sparingly with lots of rice. I've given this place a couple tries to see if it was just off days but... consistently salty salty salty. Also their braised mackerel is so fishy. Supposed to not be that fishy if you make it the right way. Pretty disappointing considering all the good reviews.","I loved the rice cake so yummy and I had a bowl with rice and kimchi, tasty.This place it's really good, I really liked it. the service was good and they are friendly staff.I would go with friends, family or just walk in by yourself","I would have to say that this spot falls into my top ten Korean digs. It's a very small joint in the middle of bustling restaurant scene in Astoria. The staff is very accommodating and the food is on point. Food: I would have to say the chicken wings we got was not the best since Korean spots are know to have amazing wings, they'll have to work on that. My 2 cents""The rest of the food we ordered made up for the wings. My dish was served as I've expected. It's like a match made in heaven when the food taste as good as it looks. You are a very happy person. My partners meal was the classic bibimbab which she said did not disappoint as well. Overall, a solid 5 star for this joint. Minus the wings of course. My new Korean joint is Astoria. Yesss.","Yum yum in your yum. Finally a nice Korean place with good flavor! I always love me some all you can eat but this place is a la carte. They have meals that are the perfect size for one person or you can order a few items and share. My husband and I share everything because we like to try a lot of items off the menu. Pork buns are good, japche, bulgogi bowl with sides. Good stuff here. It's small but I love it that way.",KAL
68,"I was excited to try this place but was disappointed in the amount of time it took for the food to come out. It took over an hour and when asked about the wait, the waitress said it'll be a while because there are people waiting that were there before us. Was their a shortage in cooks? Because the place wasn't that crowded. We even ordered an appetizer so we can have something to nibble on while we wait. The app was Mac n cheese which came out warm unfortunately my entree didn't. but did i want to wait another hour for another meal? Hell no. So i didn't even say anything about it. Guess what zucchini waffles are actually good. That's why there's an extra star! But i won't be back. If you go, please take the wait time into account. Don't go there hungry like i did!",The decor is nice and it looks like a inviting place. The waiters were nice. But omg our food was TERRIBLE. The avocado toast had barely any avocado like NOTHING. Then the belinis were watered down. I don't think I'll be coming back nor recommending it,The food and service are underwhelming. I went twice (the second time to give it another chance) and was sorely disappointed both times. Wouldn't recommend.,Had our baby shower here last weekend with 100 guests. Everything went great from the bartenders to the food being out timely and tasty. The owner Rohan was very accomodating to our schedule and letting my sister and cousin be there early and the night before to decorate.Everything went off without a hitch and we had a great time! Great venue for a private event,"Drinks were strong and well made. The avocado fries, truffle mac and cheese, and korean wings were great appetizers. Had the hot wings which were way too hot for me and the tacos that had a bit to much spice. For entree we had the pizza with pulled chicken and the bourbon sauce. The sauce was too sweet and just a little off. The next time we went we did the fish and chips which the chips were spiced fries that were delicious.My husband got the steak and the deconstructed elote was delicious.Definitely want to go back and try more. Very extensive menu","DISCLAIMER: the wait after ordering your food IS long. That is true.After much skepticism, I was convinced to visit.I can't begin to explain how happy I am, that I changed my mind.I came for the bottomless brunch.My partner got the catfish and waffle (it's not on the brunch menu, but she asked for the catfish instead of the chicken b/c she's pescatarian and they gladly accommodated)My best friend got the chicken and waffle.I got the fried chicken Benny.All I can honestly say is... wow.The food was MIND BLOWING. Savory. Delicious. The textures.I give reviews based on customer service and quality/taste of food. A wait shouldn't deter someone from enjoying fresh, delicious food.Our server Michelle was on point with the mimosa refills.I can't wait to come back for dinner.",Queens Bully
69,"This review is only for the lunch staff.  Not friendly like the night staff.  I bought their Cheeseburger special. The burger was tasty, but there was no urgency. Daytime.. lunch rush.. people don't want to wait 30 minutes for a burger.  At dinnertime that might fly, but not when people have to get back to work. At night, when it's busier, I get it twice add fast!","I ordered take out via Grubhub. I selected the whole  chicken with sides and soda. The delivery was very VERY quick. Unfortunately the chicken was over cooked and dry. The skin was tasty but the chicken was disappointing. I have a theory as to why the delivery was so fast....probably because they had a whole chicken on the rotisserie from their lunch shift, packed it up and delivered it to me!","They did it again...we called to make an order from work and they sent it wrong. Working in the airline industry, we are timed even to eat! During our lunch hour we planned to all have tres golpe, and were very clear as to how we would want each order to be made. Initially (after order was paid for), we thought we would receive the order within the usual 30min. The lady Jenny then called to say there's no car until 11a to deliver the order into LGA. WEIRD. She then calls and says she found someone, and we were so excited. Until we received the order...the one order that was regular (quesos, salami y huevo) was not made correctly. When I called to inquire she begins yelling, that this I not her fault, that we ordered a tres golpe...(exactly!!! And never came! And she was herself saying that we ordered), that we ordered wrong, that there's nothing she will do toFix it bc she has no driver and we should've made the order right the first time. This is so disappointing. Her solution later was for me to send her an egg, and she'll send me two slices of cheese. Like really? What kind of people is this person used to dealing with??This is the second time this week this  happens and there has to be a way that owners are more selective of who they have answering the phones..this lady even hung up in my face, claiming it was by mistake, even though it was right after she yelled her side of the story.. With my previous experiences, it seems like it's going downhill. It's a shame because it used to be such a great asset to the community, and the food is usually so fresh..but the lack of customer service is literally the downfall of this business..or maybe their lack of customer service to us airline employees is just not up to par! Please, please fix this...","A Dominican friend of mine bought me food from here months earlier . Her confidence in the food carried over to me as I tried it back then so I promised myself that I'd have to make the trek to get that bomb a$$ food . I met with the lovely Rosa at the counter and she took my order . She was exceptionally patient as I asked a million questions and treated me like her own son. I ended up ordering the basic and typical Dominican meal of white rice , red beans, roasted chicken and of course fried plantains . Everything was just perfect ! I particularly was fond of the rice and  beans which just seemed to melt in the mouth . Honestly this food tasted like what you WISH your Grandmother could make . It's that good . Being wowed by an ordinarily basic meal is worthy of 5 stars !Make sure to arrive abit early though if you're making the trek as the food does sell out particularly the chicken and beef. ( I wasn't able to get the big piece of chicken this time . ) so don't let that be you.","Ok, first the food is authentic and AWESOME!  Three of us sat outside and enjoyed chicken mofongo, garlic shrimp & beans/rice.  Rachely was our server and I think a family member.  Sweet, bright smile and great customer service.Did I mention the food?  This is a small place with 2 four tops outside and maybe 6 four tops inside.  Since it was a great afternoon we ate outside.  Very pleasant with friendly locals walking by.Rachely started us with a chicken soup with fresh limes, something we didn't order but was fantastic.  We all said we could have that alone, but we were eager to try our entrees.  The three of us split the two entrees and we brought leftovers back to the hotel.Real deal here.  Flavors were just great.  Highly recommend this place!","This place exceeded my expectations. The reviews were great, but I didn't think I would get such great service. Rosa went above and beyond. I had the beef quesadillas and an empanada. Fantastic, hot, and fresh food.I will definitely be back when I return from my trip!",LaGuardia Cafe
70,"Bottom line: nice small cafe, good food but uncoordinated service really draws from the experience. Bit pricey to not have good service. Gluten line: nice clearly labeled menu with lots of options. Halloumi fries were delicious!Long line: we'd been wanting to come here for a while but the experience fell short of our expectations. We missed the brunch, but still wanted to enjoy a drink and some appetizers. Service was terrible uncoordinated, with 3 people randomly coming at odd, spaced out intervals and at times seeming like they were all hiding in the back. A bit disappointing to be sitting for so long with empty drinks and plates.","This is my go to spot, I am a frequent patron of the Thirsty Koala... What went wrong today lets start shall we;Our waitress ISA really didn't want to be there today! Never once checked on our table to even take away dirty plates, till I had to physically call her over to hand her the finished plates to take away. This girl had that I hate my job face & work ethic to match, she prefers to just hang out in the back and do whatever else. Appetizers:The Calamari has always been one of my favs here & today it was good as usual. The Grilled Octopus was banging also! Entrees:The Arugula Salad w/ Salmon was served with avocados that had patches of BLACK & that is a no no to serve! The salmon was dry & nothing to brag about. The same goes for the Beef Burger, the beef was bland & even more BLAND. I use to swear by there Burger *NOT NO MORE*! The Lamb Lollies were off the hook Fatty & Cooked perfectly! It was heaven in every fatty bite. Just like how I remembered them.Thirsty Koala was my no question go to spot. In my book FOOD & SERVICE goes hand in hand, in a establishment such as the Thirsty Koala & today was just a disappointment.",Please add the koala chocolate truffles back to the menu so that I can eat here again,The Koala gets a solid 5 stars. We just moved to the neighborhood and decided to walk down Ditmars to find somewhere to eat. We were immediately drawn to this place when we walked by. We sat outside around 8 o'clock and were seated immediately. They were even pup friendly outdoors which is huge for us as we often don't go out without our fur baby!!!! We got the quinoa burger and the Ned Kelly (cooked medium) - both were fantastic!!! Quinoa burger side was the garlic mashed potatoes and they perfect. Got the shoestring fries with the Ned Kelly. Shoestring fries were cooked to perfection. So delicious. The inside was packed and it wasn't loud at all. Everyone was having a great time. The music selection atthis place is on point as well. Such a great vibe. We will be regulars at this place for sure.,"This was listed on a website for gluten free restaurants and is nearby my apartment which was the main reason we chose this for a quick and casual dinner. I was completely amazed by the entire experience and will definitely be making this a regular date night spot! The entree list is entirely gluten free and the waiter shared with us that all of the fryer baskets are dedicated gluten free as well. Between the peace of mind knowing my celiac date wouldn't have to worry about getting ill from his meal and the wide variety of vegetarian options for me that weren't just pasta and salad, I could not believe how perfect this place was. I had the roasted acorn squash which was outstanding and came in such a large portion I was able to make three meals out of it. My date was so excited about the GF beer battered fried cod that he asked the waiter a few times just to be sure it really was celiac friendly! It meant a lot to be able to see him thoroughly enjoy his dinner without concern. The wait staff were very busy but friendly and personable so we truly didn't mind waiting for the check or for a drink refill. I really loved that our waiter made recommendations about his personal favorites from the menu, it means a lot more to hear that from someone who works there and encouraged me to try something different. The music was extremely loud when we first arrived, almost like they were trying to drown out the sound of people trying to talk to each other but it was lowered to a reasonable volume after the rush started to slow down a bit. The overall ambiance was cute and modern, I liked the decor and the multiple seating options (high tops, bench seats, backed chairs, bar stools)Overall, a really great find in a really accessible location. I will definitely be returning again soon and plan on introducing many friends and family members who come to visit as well!","Highly accommodating establishment. Our server, Caleb was amazing! We got there 45 min after our reservation time (totally underestimated the commute to Astoria) and they still seated us right away. Their brunch special is probably one of the better ones - $25 for unlimited drinks with a purchase of one entreè. The drink list is extensive. They offered really good cocktails on top of your usual mimosas and bellinis. The food was also good, huge portions, we felt like our omelette were made with ten eggs. The halloumi fries here were out of this world! Would come back to try their lamb chops, I've heard great things!",The Thirsty Koala
71,"Decided to revisit this place after a while.  I visited this place a few times when it first opened.  Food was ok but I always had a problem with the service one way or another. Last time staff kept making mistakes on whether to leave a dish on our table or not.  This time one dish never came.  While I was in the middle of ordering the waitress was focused on accommodating another table,  so she ended up not writing or ordering one dish.Kept waiting for the dish that was never ordered until we talked to the waitress.  She never acknowledged the problem, but instead insisted that we never ordered it when in reality her attention was somewhere else.  It didn't make sense for 3 out of 4 people in our party to eat their own dishes while 1 waited.  The waitress observed the tables but never figured that out.  In the end I got my food but everyone else finished which was too awkward.  I ended up taking it home.  The menu stated that the Ten don had a sauce included with the rice, but it was basically rice, a few strips of nori with assorted tempura on top and a side of benishoga/yellow radish...We also ordered the tempura takoyaki, 4 pieces for $6, there was nothing tempura about the takoyaki, unless it's referring to the 1 piece of tempura scrap in the bowl... nothing about this takoyaki stood out to be unique. Only consistent thing about service was constantly filling the tea.  But in general the proportions are smaller, and there are other areas to get better japanese food now.","For a ramen spot in Flushing, you'd think it would want to make a name for itself.Lackluster ramen. Some parts were cold, including the pork slices. 2 stars because the service was nothing to complain about, and the sushi rolls aren't too shabby.  Better off taking the drive to Astoria/Sunnyside for other ramen spots, or a trip to the city for ippudo.","No detailed response about the bad service was given to me as the owner claims.To the owner:Please don't ask me to take down my review. It was the experience I had at the time. I'm sure many others enjoy your restaurant but you should not expect or ask for bad reviews to be taken down if a patron has a negative experience that you've given them, despite whatever circumstances your staff had. Don't make up lies that you responded to me a few months ago when I only visited and reviewed once. Thank you for taking the time to respond now but loss of 1 customer isn't too detrimental to you.","First off the menu has an abundance of options - So. Many. Options. Limited seating so be open to sitting at the counter! We ordered the shoyu ramen and mentaiko cream pasta, both were really good. The ramen is light and doesn't have a thick milky broth like most places. If that's not your thing, you're better off getting something else. Mentaiko pasta comes with or without cream cheese with a difference of a $1. I opted in for the cream version and was not disappointed. It is very very creamy and may be overwhelming if you don't like cream based pasta. The pasta was cooked perfectly and chewy just the way it should be. We left completely satisfied and would be back again.",This place was seriously incredible. The broth was so savory and flavorful. There was the perfect ratio of noodles to meat to vegetable. Everything tasted fresh and well prepared.The staff was very nice and the place was really clean. I really want to come back to try all the other delicious looking dishes they offer. It's definitely a place you need to come back a few times to to get the complete experience.And the best part is there's an ice cream place right next door for dessert. Win win,"We came here a few years ago to Hashi Ramen and Izakaya for ramen and thought the food was average. We stopped by for lunch the other day, and the visit did not change our impression. Dishes We Had:- Shrimp Cream Pasta ($14): A tasty, decently-sized portion somewhat lacking in ingredients. Includes three medium-sized shrimp.- Rainbow Roll ($15), Salmon and Avocado Roll ($7): These rolls contain raw fish, which were OK, though not the freshest. The rice surrounding the rolls was a bit thick, particularly in the Salmon and Avocado Roll. - Shrimp Tempura Roll ($7.50): the shrimp tempura lacked crispness, and could have been yesterday's shrimp tempura. Food: OK (3 of 5).Service: OK (3 of 5). Complimentary tea and refills. Suggested tips start at 18%, and are calculated on the post-tax total.Value: We've Had Better (2 of 5). Hashi Ramen and Izakaya is a bit pricey for its offerings.",Hashi Ramen & Izakaya
72,"The service is ok.But the price, the portion and the taste are not ok at all. It takes 19.00 dollars to have few pieces just ok sashimi and another 19.00 to have 5 not so ok skewers.This restaurant is on my black list. oh, you may still go there (believe those elites' who gave five stars!)",We wanted to order everything but just not enough mouths... errrrrr.They don't take reservations.. what the heckkk!!!  I can skip the the sushi/sashimi... everything else were yummy... planning to go back very soon !,"I was excited to take my parents to drink the frozen beer here after having been to the Ktown location myself. The omu soba and yaki udon were too sweet for our taste, but palatable. But then... I ordered the shoyu tonkotsu ramen and it was the worst ramen I've ever had. Up until that point I've always believed that for me, ramen is a dish that's good--even when it's bad. The smell of the broth was so OFF. It was putrid. It was obvious that they carelessly threw bones and carcass into a pot and boiled it into oblivion, it smelled so unclean. My parents flat out refused to try a bite. The noodles were packaged dry noodles that were undercooked. I couldn't eat more than two bites.I would still come back for post dinner drinks, but I would nottttt order food here.","Came in with a group of friends right when it opened so we were seated right away. Right off the bat I was pretty impressed with their selection of food because I have never seen their dishes in other Japanese restaurants before. I wanted to try everything but of course, we wouldn't be able to finish it all. We ended up ordering Omu Soba, Miso Carbonara Udon, French Fries, Crispy Crab roll, and Takoyaki, and more. I was surprised by the french fries because they didn't taste like regular fries. They were so light and airy, I loved it. The fries came with ketchup and spicy mayo and those are the two condiments I would usually go for, so that was perfect. The takoyaki and crispy crab roll didn't have a unique taste to me, but they were still delicious and flavorful. The omu soba came out next and it was so large. The whole dish tasted so good! The soba and the egg were so flavorful. Unlike many restaurants, the pork slices weren't chunky; they were literally such thin slices. The miso carbonara uson tasted good too, but I personally felt like there was too much cheese to it. Overall, this place is great. Service was fine and the food was great. The prices are a little bit up there, but it would be a great place to go to once in a while. Definitely would want to return.","Came here on a Thursday night . It was not crowded at first then started to get busy around 8. They have a special seasonal lavender cocktail with a little yuzu flavor in it ($9). Very refreshing . We ordered some appetizers to start :yellowtail Carpaccio - a little too much red onions to overpower the fish Grilled skewers set B (scallops, shitaki mushroom , egg bacon, shrimp, miso tofu) - the temperature could be higher but the egg bacons were delicious.Takoyaki - very crispy , one of the best that we ever had .Then we ordered the kimchi cream udon and salt tonkotsu ramen for entrees. The kimchi cream udon was really good even on a heavier side . The ramen was good and Chashu porks  had a charred flavor. We were so full and satisfied. The bill came out to $80 something without tips was not bad .","I had the kimchi cream udon, renkon chips, and lavender cocktail. Everything was superb. The kimchi undon seems to be prepared in an alfredo sauce with smaller pieces of kimchi mixed in. I found it rich and satisfying. I'd like to see some flying fish roe and some furijake or small flakes of dried nori to round out the dish.Great dining experience and great addition to the Flushing area!",Izakaya Mew Flushing
73,Horrible experience. We ordered take out for the first time from here. The chicken in my pasta was so rubbery. My husband got the carbonara. I cannot describe how bad the smell of it was. It smelled like dog food! It was unbelievable. I called the restaurant to tell them how disappointed we were and that we couldn't eat any of the food. The manager kept telling me how sorry they were but that carbonara isn't a dish that should be ordered for take out. He said he would refund me the money. This was 12 days ago. Still no refund. I'm not recommending this place to ANYONE.,"I just want to update my review.  I'm a regular customer and last night I ordered the veal Parmesan on seamless after an employee of the restaurant recommended it.  I called before my order to check if it was good.  Person who answered the phone was rushing and apologized for being rude..at least he admitted it.When we got the food after 2 hours, the veal was hard as a rock and you couldn't cut into it.  It was just BAD!  We tried to get our money back for the inedible food but Seamless said the restaurant refused.  Never again!  You have lost our business forever!  Unacceptable!","I ordered the Spaghetti con Polpette. It was inedible. The meatballs tasted rancid and like they had been frozen for quite a while, and the sauce was worse than Chef Boyardee. I ordered it based on it being rated on yelp as the best spaghetti and meatballs in Astoria. I can't get the taste out of my mind or mouth, and I'm angry to have wasted my money. I had heard good things about this place several years ago and just got around to trying it. May have been good in the past but it is inexcusable for an Italian restaurant to serve such a standard dish at this level.","This is honestly the best Italian food I've ever had, and I'm a very picky person. My favorite dish are the short ribs and gnocchi! However I've never tried a bad dish. I've never visited in person, but somehow they transport their delivery food in a way where it seems like it's right from the kitchen. No clue how they do it! Staff has been very accomodating of requests as well. I don't think I'll ever be able to move out of Astoria with Ornella Trattoria around.","A decent Italian spot in Astoria near the Astoria-Dittmars subway stop.Overall: 3.5/5 Food: 3.5/5 Service: 3.5/5 Decor: 3.5/5 Value: 4/5Thursday is $10 pasta night, which is a pretty good deal for the fairly large portion they give. We got the spaghetti carbonara and the rigatoni amatriciana. Both had pancetta which was nice but both dishes were a bit salty to me. The bread was a bit hard, but I liked how they provided olive oil and balsamic vinegar upon request. Overall a decent deal for the $10 price point but at the original $17 price per pasta dish, there other options worth considering. Service was a bit sparse - had to try multiple times to flag down a server to request something or the bill.","Ordered delivery from here. It was absolutely wretched.  The gnocchi was hard, and I would have had a better experience enjoying a salt lick than trying to eat the sauce. As for the other dish I ordered....pasta di castagna....I don't even know where to begin, it was a pile of sweet greasy mush. The tiramisu was good. That's about it. $60 for a completely inedible order. Don't waste your time or money.",Ornella Trattoria Italiana
74,"We used to come here once a week. But it isn't worth it anymore. The place is quite dirty. The menu is sticky with greased oil.The walls are stained.The seats and tables are also sticky.The new waiters are rude and rush you to order (in an empty restaurant).The Hainanese chicken we ate was raw. No, it really is raw. There's Hainanese cooked almost done chicken, and there's getting yelled at by Chef Ramsey Raw, and it's definitely the latter.If you want good food, just walk literally next door to the right to the giant HK food court with so many more options, and most importantly, it's clean and they serve edible foods.",Average Malaysian place. Doesn't really make me crave coming back. There are a bunch of places in Elmhurst worth going to. It's good but not great and I won't miss it if I haven't been in a while. I had the hainanese Chicken and hokkien noodles. Roti also was thicker than I wanted. I guess I miss the places in Flushing and wanted to find a replacement. The search continues,"Been going there for many years. Went back last week for a quick meal. Ordered my fave Singapore laksa (#82) The noodle came out with a thick white soup, couldn't see what's inside, and the ingredients were nothing like before. The fried tofu for example - was  not fried tofu. It was gluten. Check out other Singapore laksa photo others took and check out mine. Please tell me mine looked different. I couldn't drink the soup. It was all coconut milk/cream. What happened to the chef? First day at the job? I asked the waiter what's this. He smiled and said it is normal and it's made sweet to please their customers. Hmmmm ... REALLY? I said it's never like this before. He said I ordered the wrong item. No I ordered Singapore laksa #82 We also ordered a hokkien udang mee (shrimp noodles #91). Thats looked and tasted normal. No issues at all. I rated this place 4 stars before. I am revising my review as quality and consistency aren't the same anymore. Very disappointing.","Restaurants like this are the tendons that hold the culinary muscles onto the skeleton of the city, IMO. When I walk into a restaurant and I'm the only white person there, it's all people from the locale where said restaurant serves up cuisine from, I have a pretty good idea it's the real deal. The former residents of those countries are eating here, not at the newest fusion restaurants with reclaimed wood tables and $12 cocktails when I can get a full meal for that price at places like this. I seem to really have it in for those places...Anyway, this restaurant is located next to a seafood restaurant, which in turn is located next to a big Asian supermarket, located a short walk from the Elmhurst Ave. station. It's rather thin and deep, as usual, with walls of their dishes adorning one of the walls, presumably to help certain diners, be they ""white males pointing at the wall and asking repeatedly 'wuzzat' or... others? Tables were... standard. Booth seats and chars, nothing fancy but nothing rickety. Cash only; no cards.I've had four dishes here. The Singapore Kari Laksa is my favorite thus far; noodle soup with shrimp, bean sprouts, egg, I think it had chicken, and coconut milk based broth. It was amazing. Now I want a bowl. The Hokkien Udang Mee was great as well, but not amazing like the Kari Laksa. Smorgasbord of items as usual, tomato-based broth so if you're watching calories or something, try this. The Nasi Lemak was a tad on the small side, but peanuts, egg, mixed vegetables, I think fried chicken or goat curry, can't remember, and rice, so a rich medley. The Hainanese chicken was... disappointing to me. Very mild, almost... boiled, in my opinion. If you like milder stuff and not stuff that will knock your socks off, like I do, give this a shot. I've seen people eating this all the time.So yeah, you don't want General Tso's chicken from the small cheap shops, which is as Chinese as a hot dog? You don't want to pay $30 for gluten-free noodles in Manhattan? Come on down to Elmhurst and give this place a shot.","Sometimes, it's the 'hole in the walls' spots, that have the best food. This is my favorite Malaysian restaurant in the borough of Queens. it's very close to the Elmhurst Ave. subway stop (M, R train). The place is small, & not necessarily good for big groups. Also, you don't come here for the decor. Half the time, i order the Kari Laksa. Love the creamy curry broth this noodle dish comes in (topped with seafood). I always request them to substitute the noodles to the mai fun noodle (no extra charge). They also have a nice hot sauce that boosts the spicy level of this dish. Other dishes I've tried have all been very good. My best recommendations would be, pandan ayam (fried chicken wings wrapped in some sort of leaf, that's edible), beef rendang (tender beef stew), & seafood chow fun (broad noodle in an egg-y sauce).","Recently discovered this small Chinatown area in Elmhurst, it became my new favorite to dine. Not as far as flushing and not as expensive as Chinatown. And talking about authenticity, this Malaysian place is a so far the best I've been in New York.This place is very small and doesn't even have a big store front nor a fancy sign. A small door leads to a cozy place that's not very big but turn around quite fast as their service is real fast. They have a very big menu, a lot of authentic Malaysian dishes, We ordered Roti Canai for starter, 1/2 hainan chicken, small order of bah kut teh and a Singapore laksa to share, all the food taste very authentic and delicious. Especially bah kut teh comes with ribs, intestines and pork belly in very strong herb soup. Brings back the memory of those small hole in the wall place in Malaysia that offers the best food. The total came out only $38 for both of us. Very reasonable compare to other Malaysian restaurants",Taste Good Malaysian Cuisine
75,"Words can't even explain how disgusted  I am,  -  In  rage after paying $114 for what was suppose to be an enjoyable Family Friday night dinner ....  I ordered 2x Amatriciana Bianca , I was speechless when I saw the presentation of this dish.Dried out and stuck together wasn't my expectation of such expense dish. I called Tuscan Hills and asked for Management immediately.Not only was the dish incomplete , The manger who assisted me on the phone was inconsiderate and had no solution other then  ""than don't eat it"".Congratulations , this party of four will no longer support Tuscan Hills !",The food was above average for the prices they charge. $22 for fettuccini with a light sauce and watered down mushrooms is quite a lot of money.  What made my dinner unbearable was the rude and ambivalent service I received. I spent over $60 for by dinner and was treated like I was an annoyance to the waiters rather than a valued customer. I will never go back again.,Everything started off ok ... until my boyfriend and I ordered the tiger shrimp entree and he found hair in his food ... not to mention since we wanted privacy we sat in the front because the restaurant was empty. I am a very observant person especially when I am spending my money and I noticed how dirty their walls were ... I don't spend money where the walls have food splatter and dust... Next time we will pass .,"Reason why I gave it a four-star instead of at five? I'm almost 100% sure the oil they served with the bread was canola oil.. and the bread was cold. The oil had absolutely no flavor. The only thing you could taste was the crushed up (olives?) inside of it. That's a real bummer because I really look forward to my warm bread and good quality olive oil at all Italian restaurants. All that aside, the Gnocchi was amazing and I would go back for that. Perfectly cooked... beware of the HUGE portions! You could easily split as I ate almost exactly half of my huge plate and my grandma ate about exactly half of hers.","Someone in the neighborhood who is a foodie and, like me, eats out almost every night, thought my previous review might have been unfair. So, I took her to TH and said, I'd give it another chance.It was even worse. We got stuck with the same waitress, who exactly as I wrote earlier, completely dismissed us the moment we said we didn't drink and gave us to another server. This time the shorter male server who's been there for awhile. But, had the table next to us and behind us and couldn't have been more friendly or pleasant with them. Though, she was rude with another table that didn't seem to order a lot of pricey stuff. Having worked on Wall Street for so long, and eaten at some of the best restaurants in the city (and some of the worst), TH is one of the most disappointing, discrimination and unpleasant places I've been. The sad part is, you can't even make a comment like, well, the food is so good, they're uppity or whatever. The food was mediocre on a good day. Tonight, the pasta was dry, flavorless and lacked any sense of creativity or culinary delight. (Did I mention that my husband went to culinary school and his BFF is a highly respected culinary chef in LA.)Again, three doors down at the corner is another Italian restaurant. And, while it's a bit overpriced, the service there is welcoming and spectacular, and the food has flavor.TH has truly left us in dismay because when we get attached to a place, we tend to go a few times a week. What a disappointment.And my friend, who swore I must have misjudged, has now taken TH off her list of favorites and unbookmarked it. Her parting words were, your review was too generous.","If there was an apocalypse and Tuscan Hills was the only remaining restaurant on the planet, I still would not go back. A few days ago, my review would probably have been much different. But, last night we really got to see the true Tuscan Hills, and it wasn't pretty. Almost 24 hours later and I'm incredibly annoyed by the way we were treated and the whole experience.My husband and I discovered TH about two or three weeks ago. Since then we've been about 7 times. Twice I've done take out. Last night, we decided to grab a quick bite on the way home. It was probably 5 p.m. and there may have been four tables seated, with three servers. Well, I'm not entirely sure the third person was a server, but I'll get to that in a moment.For the THIRD time we were seated in section of the female server. And, for the THIRD time she completely changed her demeanor when she came to our table and was noticeably  unfriendly. The minute we said we didn't drink, she excused herself and passed our table off to someone else. The first two times it was the shorter waiter with the goatee. In this case, it was to the person we assume is the back waiter.  What was interested was how friendly, funny, gregarious and personable she was with her other tables, including the one right next to us, where she laughed and joked, made suggestions about which dishes were good, and offered them coffee and dessert.But with us, not even a smile. It was dismissive and rude, and made us feel unwelcome, as if we didn't belong there. It dumbfounds me that we would be treated this way.It was even more annoying to see the owner, who I introduced myself to the night before when I stopped by to pick up take out, and even said hello to as we walked in, go around and interact with the three other tables but not us.So, at this point, I am very annoyed and just want to leave. But Jayson was exhausted and he didn't want to start doing restaurant hopping, so I begrudgingly stayed, for him. Instead of enjoying a full meal and having a relaxing dinner as we planned, we only ordered an appetizer and a pasta dish. Here's where it gets more unbelievable. They managed to cook and prepare our food and have it on the table LITERALLY in less than FIVE minutes! WTF? Seriously, we just ordered. I literally got up to wash my hands, and Jayson was texting me to say the food was there.Did we just get leftovers or someone else's food? From the taste of it, quite possibly. It was COLD STALE AND TASTELESS. Neither were fresh. If I wasn't so annoyed by all the other stuff, I would have sent it back. But I really just wanted to leave.They didn't even give us a chance to chill. I mean, the other night, it took 20 minutes to prepare my shrimp and pasta. But this time, our food was on our table in less than five minutes. Could they make us feel any less welcome?Not once did anyone come over to check on us or ask how things were.This once was our FAVORITE new spot. But what a difference a day makes. They ruined was should have been a lovely dinner after a long day.With so many other Italian restaurants in the neighborhood, and even on the same block, you'd think they'd care about treating guests right. More than happy to dine elsewhere.",Tuscan Hills
76,"When I first tried this place, I remember it being so good. When I went there for the second time, it was a complete different experience. First, our server. She was horrible. Attitude and just not welcoming at all. Second, the food. What happened?? I was so disappointed, mostly at myself for going back. Beef sausage was horrible. Stay away. And it came with nothing. Tried a few other dishes and wasn't a fan. This is definitely a ""this area has been gentrified"" trademark. The only thing that was good was the pancake. I should've just ordered like 5 of those. This place has definitely earned a place on my ""please, do not go back"" list.","Not good.Give me the wrong menu, brought me the wrong food. I ate it anyways, which I shouldn't have. The fish burger they gave me was greasy and soggy. I was not feeling well after I ate it. Not worth the time and money.",The worst service. They gave me the menu but never came to get the order. I waited 15mins and left.,"Came here with the boyfriend about a month ago during our wanderings in Astoria. Seriously such a unique gem of a place! We ordered a few Himalayan inspired dishes, including the momos, all of which was incredible, savory and delicious. I snuck peeks at the tables next to us, which were laden with brunch options, like French toast, etc, the alternative menu they offer in addition to their Himalayan dishes. We'll have to try that next time. I loved how it looked inside as well, from the flags above to the table settings and plateware. Everything was simple, with a feeling of calm joy.Will definitely be back!","You can tell when there is a lot of heart and love in a place by the way it's decorated, and Dawa's has it all. We tried the Beef Momo, chicken stir fried noodle, and their Beef tongue with Bok Choy, my friends and I enjoyed everthing we ordered, it was delicious, just the right amount of spices and so much flavor. The portion was good enough for three (not super hungry) girls :). Their prices are reasonable and you can tell how every dish is prepared with attention. I just started following their IG handle @dawasnyc, and found out hey have their own little backyard where they harvest some of their ingredients,  just love it. I can't wait to be back here and try out their other amazing menu items.","A Queen's gem, Dawa's is one of our favorite places to go because of the cool ambiance, the super delicious food, lovely waitstaff, and awesome and friendly owner (if you're lucky enough to meet her).  They have a dedicated American menu as well as a Himalayan menu, and oftentimes they try different things and experiment which is fun for regulars since there's always something unique to try.  My favorite go-to dish however, is the Chili Chicken (""Jasha Katsa""), served with buckwheat ting-mo (steamed bun), which I recently learned was taken off the brunch menu and only available for dinner.  It's a simple dish with complex flavors, and the tingmo dipped in the sauce from the dish is such a fantastic combination of texture, aromatic spice and flavor.  It is just so comforting, I would eat it every day if I could! I like that they utilize locally sourced seasonal ingredients, and pay careful attention to naturals and organics, making their food not only impossibly delicious but healthy, too.  Dawa's is one of my top ten restaurants in all of Queens, which is saying A LOT because this borough has a dizzying variety of incredible world cuisines.",Dawa's
77,"In Forest Hills and craving noodles, particularly noodle soup? Look no further than Xin Taste Hand Pull Noodles at the far end of the neighborhood! It is definitely a revisited spot when I'm craving beef hand pulled (or peeled!) noodles and when I'm not in Flushing. I first had my taste of this flavor profile in Flushing and ever since, I always crave this dish! The broth here is on point and the meat is tender and delicious. The noodles are just right depending on what type of noodle you want: everything is pulled/peeled on premises! If you're feeling like a thicker noodle, go with the ""peeled"" noodle. This small hole-in-the-wall noodle shop also has some seating for dining in, but be aware that it gets packed! Not particularly great for groups. There is also some appetizers like dumplings, fried chicken, and fried sausage. For drinks, there's nothing extravagant, although the herbal canned drink is my go-to. Customer service is great and quick. No problems here! Open decently late.Accepts card.Not sure if there's a bathroom.Bon appetit!",I had the house special with hand pulled noodle. The bowl came luke warm. The beef meats on top were COLD. I'm assuming they pick it out from the refrigerator before pouring hot broth over it. Most of the meats were thick cut and very chewy. The beef stew however was super tender but unfortunately they only gave me one tiny cube. The broth didn't have much flavor. I would recommend adding condiments. The noodle itself was clumped together and not that good. This was a time thing. I don't see myself returning.,"From prior take out experience I'm just not a fan of hand pull noodles - not my go to starch food, but their soup and proteins that goes with their noodles are top notch","Outstanding Xin style noodles. Handmade noodles, thick or thin. The broth is flavorful and balanced. Beef is the way to go.Toppings are sparse but good, it's all about noodles here.The place is small and not really good for a large group. Great spot for flying solo.","the food is a straight 10 out of 10. i had it for take out. the place have some bar seatings and very limited table so it might not be the best options for large groups but come alone / in small groups / order take out, whatever floats the boat, just do yourself a favor and give this place a try. order and pay at the counter, minimum order $20 if you want to pay with card. service is okay. quick and no fuss. expect around 5-10 mins for your food to be readyi ordered the roasted duck hand peeled noodle and good thing they pack the soup separately (less spillage and doesn't turn the noodle soggy).generous amount of roast duck and it tastes superb! delicious skin and the meat is just wonderful. the hand-peeled noodle has chewy, very enjoyable consistency, and I rather like how the shape makes it look very home-made. fragrant cilantro and scallion. and OMG the broth is SO amazing! fragrant with chinese spice and has just the perfect savory taste. i can't imagine how heavenly to eat this in winter (it's summer night as I'm typing this) price is reasonable and decent portion for the size. definitely will come back!",I love to watch the guy pulling and pulling the noodle to make them longer and thinner right in front of us.  My kids love to watch as well. My fav there is the beef hand pulled noodle soup.  Love the beef tendons they serve with it. The mixed meat one is my next fav.  The duck noodle soup is delicious as well but make sure they don't give you the neck as the meat. To the owner: Please throw out the duck neck. Do not serve it.  We do not pay for getting neck as a meat as one time I got served all neck bones. I felt ripped off. I love to add their spicy oil to the soup base.,Xin Taste Hand Pull Noodle
78,"Ordered half rack of ribs with sauce. The bbq sauce was terrible. The ribs were tasteless.The service was was substandard. The server was not attentive. If you are looking for bbq, this restaurant is a total bust. Kathy K, thanks for the response. I was there on Sunday, September 8th at table 404 at 628pm.","Ordered half rack of ribs with sauce. The bbq sauce was terrible. The ribs were tasteless.The service was was substandard. The server was not attentive. If you are looking for bbq, this restaurant is a total miss","I've been living in Astoria for years now, and finally decided to eat at this supposed neighborhood staple. We visited after the dinner rush in a weeknight, and I noticed that our waitress had a friend come into the restaurant, which normally would not be anything to write about. However, after our waitress ""took"" our order (i.e. tried to memorise it), she then proceeded to have a lengthy conversation with her friend as she was putting our order into the register. So of course, our order came out wrong! She messed up our drink order, forgot to add the extra honey butter for our cornbread, completely forgot an entire entree, and put in the wrong order for ribs. She was completely unapologetic about it, and even had a bad attitude when we pointed out what was missing.Oh, and these ribs... apparently the ""Fall of the Bone"" St. Louis-style ribs are nothing more than the dry-rub ribs with BBQ sauce poured on top. Anyone with an inkling of barbecue knowledge knows that St. Louis-style ribs are supposed to be finished on the grill with sauce, and not just have the sauce simply poured on the top afterwards. And they certainly were not falling off the bone at all!Horrible waitress and bad bbq ribs. At least the mac & cheese and garlic broccoli were decent - hence 2 stars...","I was hungover and cramping, their chili cheese fries are the absolute bomb so I decided to order some to be delivered as a way of treating myself! Extra jalapeños! Turns out I wasn't supposed to be able to order them online during brunch time Oops! Instead of calling to cancel they called letting me know that it would just take slightly longer for the kitchen to prep the necessary things! So so sweet of them especially since I said they didn't have to!!The brussel sprouts here are also some of the best I've ever had! Definitely not healthy for your body but top notch for your soul","Really expected this place to be great based on the 4 star rating with over 1,900 reviews plus the hype it was getting from friends that picked it....but it fell short. For starters, the beer I ordered was no longer being served (but was one of the 10 being advertised), the food took almost an hour to come out (the place was probably 1/4 filled. Not busy at all), AND when the food finally did come the order was wrong. So needless to say I was not too happy with the first impression. -Smoke House BBQ Burger: 3/5, it was alright. The burger itself was like any other burger with bbq sauce on it. I've gotten burgers before with pulled brisket or pork on top so I was excited thinking this was the same, it was not. Instead it was two slices of very mediocre brisket slapped on top of the burger. This was my mistake as I thought it would be pulled not sliced. -Beef Brisket: 2/5, honestly shocked at how underwhelming the brisket was here. Very dry, with not much flavor. -Mac & Cheese: 4/5, thankfully this was great and saved the meal. For $6 I had high hopes which were met by this side. Great flavor. Overall, had I gone into this place not knowing about all the hype and hearing everyone rave about it I would've thought it was just another BBQ joint. After eating here though I personally feel that I would not return. The food and the experience were both subpar and I've definitely had much better BBQ food at other spots. Still glad I gave this place a shot though.","Went with the family for my dads bday party of 5. Great BBQ spot in Astoria. Love the Decor huge American flag hanging on the wall. Started with an appetizer had the ""burnt ends"". It's small taste great you can kill it by yourself.   The ""smoked pork belly"" basically chicharrón thinly sliced. It comes with the "" Porkys platter"" You can't go wrong with that. Got that with max & cheese it was on point! My dad got the dry rubbed ribs very tasty. My brother ordered ""fall of the bone"" ribs had wayyyy to much bbq sauce so ask for it on the side.   Service was GREAT! Our servers name was Christina she was helpful when my dad asked a billion questions. She was energetic, informative,patient and did all that with a smile. They don't wear name tags she has light eyes and a smile that could light up a room! She recommended the ""bourbon banana bread"" which was really good. All it that was missing was a scoop of ice cream to go along with it. Idk what they pay her but GIVE HER A RAISE!!!!   Will definitely be back Great food and Great service! Also, check in and you'll get 10% of your bill of $20 or more!",Butcher Bar
79,"[+]- it's been so long since I've had stinky tofu. Last time I had it was in Taiwan and I was ecstatic to find out that they served stinky tofu here! It's also served after 6 PM. - I ordered the calamari [-]- chicken was not good. - although they had stinky tofu, it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It wasn't extremely stinky like the ones in Taiwan (maybe cause the neighbor businesses don't like the smell?) but besides the point, the tofu tasted very watered down, like soggy with a faint taste.","Had salt pepper pork, chinese cabbage and flys head.Cabbage was without flavor and the worst I ever had in a chinese restaurant.Salt pepper pork was flavorful, flys head was as expected and spicy. Mediocre experience, most likely will not travel to flushing for this","Worst service ever had ! my friend got a spicy pepper in the dish , he starts sweating ........he asked a waitress a glass of ice water , the waitress Just two feet away from him , she ignores him and keep talking to a chef over 15 mins .  we asked another two waitresses ,  they just running around and nobody give us that save life ice water . So  I went to cashier  ask a coke , we got a coke later but no straw , no glass,  I had to back to casher again to ask for a straw.  Finally  pay bill have to back to cashier again ( because no waitress  around ) , the cashier told me :"" we take cash only , and your bill is not Include tip !"" I told her I am not first day in U .S","Happened to be in Flushing and came here for a late lunch, around 2:30 pm on a Sunday.  Not too crowded for this time, a few tables were seated around us but it wasn't packed.  First time here, the inside isn't fancy but what you'd expect from a typical Chinese restaurant.  I came with my cousin and Mom who both grew up in Taiwan and they commented on all of the Taiwanese decor.  More importantly, they said it passed the authenticity test! We really enjoyed the food, and it taste authentic and ""homemade"".  We got the minced pork and chives ""flies heads"" which was delicious (beware there are some small hot peppers chopped into it which may surprise you with the heat); these tea spare ribs or short ribs which was really really good, so flavorful and tender with sweetness and saltiness; and the salt pepper pork which was well seasoned and well fried.  We got two other dishes, one I didn't eat but everyone seemed to enjoy, and a sliced pork belly dish which was also pretty good but maybe not as memorable as the others.  Service was fine, maybe because we were Taiwanese, but they seemed friendly enough.  Food came out pretty quick and was served as each dish was ready.Overall, good Taiwanese food lunch which we all really enjoyed and agreed tasted like real Taiwanese food.  If you're in the area, I'd check it out!","I closely cried at my first visit to Main street C&L imperial Taiwanese gourmet since their service was so hospitable , welcoming and let me feel home. Their chef was generous and served us with free additional dishes. (My friends told me he always does this.) Their food was pretty decent but not really surprisingly good. We highly recommend to try their hotpot with ginger and duck especially in the winter, it would warm you up immediately.","I came here on a whim. First let me say that I love the aesthetic of this restaurant. It has a post-industrial feel with lots of Taiwanese metal tins and toys hanging on the walls. The menu is very large. I tried the Three Cup Chicken, which came with bones. I started to eat around them until I realized they come out (whoops!) I've only eaten this once before at a different restaurant which had no bones. The dish was great, and I also got white rice and their hot tea. Overall great experience. This all cost $14.10 with tax, which isn't bad for the area and amount of food you get. Once I left the restaurant became packed. Will come again, thanks!",Main Street C&L Imperial Taiwanese Gourmet 北港台菜館
80,"Food was subpar taste wise and as a vegetarian having to pay extra to substitute meat for vegetables and that too for each vegetable (like 1.50 for just spinach and an another 1.50 for mushrooms) it wasn't ideal, the server was very sweet but the restaurant it self was a miss for me",$17 for a tepid dish of risotto the size and with the taste of a bowl of oatmeal. Having to get up and get your own ketchup for a $16 grilled chicken sandwich.,"We wanted to eat at Jack and Nellie's but they were full and the host recommended that we try Rove, their sister restaurant a couple of blocks away. I think that was a huge leap bad call on his part since the road is more of a bar restaurant and we had a child with us. Rove was extremely loud and the food mediocre at best. The waitress was extremely friendly and made an otherwise horrible brunch better. The food is overpriced, the poached eggs on my eggs Benedict were broken, and my boyfriends egg was completely overcooked on his breakfast burger. The flavor of the food in general wasn't bad but we ordered a side of bacon that cost four dollars and it literally was three pieces of overly deep-fried bacon. The chicken and waffles we're OK because the chicken was tender had a great dipping sauce. However, their "" homemade"" waffles we're really not very good. They were soggy and not very flavorful. I would still try Jack and Nellie's when I get a chance because I have been there before for dinner and drinks and their service/food were very good but never going back to Rove again.","Rove is a cute little restaurant right on Austin St in Forest Hills. It has a rustic modern feel to it and the decor is mostly landmarks in Queens. Its very nice! Its a very small restaurant and i think it would be hard to seat a large group of people. Luckily for me, i went with a friend on a Sunday after church at around noon. It wasn't busy when we got there but it quickly filled up after we got a tableThe food is extremely good. I got the eggs benedict. It was excellent. It came with a side of home fries and arugula. The eggs was perfectly poached and the home fries were good. To be honest, that dish was one ot the best I've ever had. My friend ordered the salmon omelet which i tried. It was very good but im not a big fan of fish in an omelet. The french fries were fresh, hot and crispy! I had never tried a pineapple mimosa. I have to say, it was really good!!Our server was the sweetest girl ever. She was very attentive and fast. She knew the menu well and recommended the pineapple mimosa. Overall, it was a great experience and I'll be back!","Folks, I was initially going to simply not review this place. My wife and just went for brunch the one time, and I was thinking 'maybe it's an off day' and I was going to leave it at that' but ah...No. Walk in, not bad, moderate noise but ya it's a bar/restaurant so this is perfectly normal, we're seated and given menus. We order out food, and I order a cup of tea. My tea come in a...Paper to go cup. Huh. this is a tad odd, but ok then, maybe they're out of mugs or something at 11:20 am? My food is...Ok. Nothing special. In hindsight, I realize that the whole 'all dishes come with toast', well maybe that doesn't count for what I got, because I didn't get toast either.... Ah well.This being said, my wife reports that her food was 'pretty good'. We've finished our food, and I'm considering getting a second cup of tea (The Horror!) and the waiter comes up to our table and proceeds to tell us... He needs our table. He's really sorry but he needs us to go. Now.Wait, what?Now?What. The Fuck.Well you see, he wanted to push our two top next to this other two top, to make a 4 top......Never mind that there are other 2 tops he could combine. He felt it was  necessary to chase US out. Right then, to seat whomever was waiting.Before then, I'd been thinking 'not bad, a shade pricey maybe give it another shot sometime'  Now?Ya, no.","My fiancé and I came here last Saturday for brunch.We called ahead to find out the wait at around 1 PM and were told that a large party just cleared out so the majority of the restaurant was empty and available for immediate seating.The menu is small and very simple, mostly egg breakfast items. The food was fresh and the portions satisfying (not overly crazy filling). We ordered the Salmon Scrambled and the Pepperjack Omelette, along with two cocktails.The cocktails were straight juice. We tasted no alcohol in neither the Fuzzy Slippers nor the Footsies cocktails. And they are priced rather high.Would definitely not recommend the cocktails.",Rove
81,"I got takeout and it wasn't that great. However, when I was waiting for my order and other peoples food look pretty great. I do take into account that the food has been taken home and has sat for a little while but very unlikely I would ever go back just due to the cost ratio.","I came here for the first time last week. I've been super excited that we have a ramen spot on Austin street but I never had a chance to run in. I decided to get the miso broth since that's generally my favorite at other ramen spots. Sadly, I thought this was some of the worst ramen I've ever had. There was so much cabbage in the broth to start, which was different and not good. The bamboo shoots in the bowl were putrid. I don't know if they were spoiled or what, but they were disgusting. Even the noodles had a weird taste. The worst was the broth, which I had an issue finding under all the salt they used. It was like licking a salt lick. It was inedible and I had to throw it out. For $15 I don't think I'll be back","I love consistency. Nothing makes going back to the same restaurant than finding a place that you know is reliable. Unfortunately, when the consistent thing is horrible service and a declining quality of food, consistency is NOT a good thing.So, I've been here four times. Three, eating at the restaurant, and once ordering take out.My first time was the week they opened. I was so excited. I am all about Asian noodle soups. So, I was over the moon when this place opened. And, our first time there was amazing. (Mind you, it was the first week.) If I had written the review that day, it would have been a five star review.But, I didn't. So, when I went back the second time, we were looking forward to it. Clearly, the honeymoon was over. The service, horrible. (Well, not as horrible as yesterday, but we'lll get to that.) Sat forever before anyone came over and even gave us water. The food was eh, mediocre at best. Definitely not five stars. And, definitely not the best ramen we've had, as we thought the first time.Then came the third time. I decided to do take out. And, this time around, I added in fried calamari. One, the soup bordered on retched. Second, the calamari was probaby in the top five of the worst I've ever had. Third, three hours later, I was throwing up and violently ill from it. I tried calling. The woman who answered only kept saying, ""you want to order."" I'd say no, ""I just got really bad food."" ""You want to order."" So, I wrote an email, which never got a response.Still, I chalked it up to maybe it wasn't the kind of food to get on take out. So, we gave them another shot, yesterday. The food was okay. It wasn't great. But, it wasn't bad. There was nothing wildly exceptional. When we were done, I asked to have it to go. And, I asked if I could please buy a container of extra broth. No restaurant has ever said no, especially since I'm offering to pay for it. My God, you'd think I asked for her first born. The waitress, who is possibly the rudest and one of the most unpleasant waitresses I've had, was not only distracted and walked away mid sentence three times, but then she said absolutely not to buying extra broth. What? Although it took 10 minute to get to that point. ""Can I get buy some extra broth?"" ... ""You want separate checks?"" ... ""No. I'd like my soup to take home and I'd like to buy some extra broth?"" ""You want to pay separately? ... It was less about a language barrier and more about her not really seeming to be paying attention.Oh, we were one of only three table in there at the time. So, no, she wasn't swamped.I really had hoped we'd get a great new restaurant. I've been to other of  Tamashii restaurants, they were great. Sadly, this was not.","Came here with my husband for a late lunch and the ramen was delicious. We've been to their spot on Vernon Blvd in LIC and they're consistent. The wait is definitely longer at the LIC one because it's smaller so if you have the choice I would go to the Forest Hills one. We got the curry ramen and our server was really great about telling us exactly what was in it e.g. pork in case we didn't eat it. The noodles have the perfect texture and the broth is flavorful and very hot. The cabbage, onions and broccoli add a great crunch. Alcohol wise they have an array of Sakes, Soju and for beer I only saw Sapporo (no wine or cocktails). Service was prompt, it's family friendly (they provide high chairs but ask that you leave your stroller by the entry because it's a small space), and they give you an 8% discount if you pay in cash.","I was craving ramen again and decided to give this place another try. The place is pretty empty but then again so is the street giving that it is Labor Day weekend. We were seated quickly and served quickly as well. Too quickly, I had just started on my takoyaki appetizer when they brought the Ramen out. I felt incredibly rushed while I decided if I wanted to let my Ramen get cold or that my takoyaki get cold. It's not that the waiter was rushing us or anything but the timing of the food coming out the kitchen was not expedited effectively. The ramen was good but nothing to write home about. The broth was not deep and rich as it should be, and the menma was over-cooked and had lost its crunch (unfortunate as this is one of my favorite toppings). However, egg was properly cooked, The noodles were perfectly done, and it was a good ratio of noodles to broth. The Gyu-don was a good portion for its price but once again, nothing to write home about. It tasted exactly like bulgogi over rice which is probably exactly what they were going for. So if you're eating with someone who doesn't like ramen or anything fishy, this might be a good choice along with the spicy pork. (This looked good on the menu, we didn't order it) Now for the good part, the Tako-wasabi was delicious, the Takoyaki had the perfect texture (and plentiful with Bonito flakes), and the Ebi-potato had a great, crunchy texture. And last but not least, their pricing was incredibly reasonable. Three tapas, two entrees, and tip totaled $44. If it weren't for the fact that the waiter did not once come back and ask us if we needed anything except when they wanted to wrap it up, I might've given four stars. I'll definitely be back...but not for the ramen. The broth is just not comparable to the other broths that are out there.","*** Reviewing on behalf of myself and a friend who is not on Yelp. I said 3 stars, my friend said 5, averaging this out to 4. This place does seem to inspire a love it or hate it reaction, so I'd recommend going just to see if you love it (then you can come back for the rest of your life) and if you hate it, it's just one meal. From my vantage point: the noodles seemed kind of cheap, the vegetables normal, the seasoning a bit heavy in sodium. I will not return. My friend's perspective: I love this place so much, if I lived here, I'd  go here all the time.Again, I would recommend trying it for yourself because people have different tastes, and for some people, this place really just hits the spot (though not for me). The reviews also have this feel (some say the worst, some say excellent).",Tamashii Red
82,"Yeah, 969 is an anomaly in a predominantly Hispanic/desi neighborhood, but the food was mediocre. Not fresh. Pork Tonkatsu Sandwich-Pork Tonkatsu was soggier than expected. I was mislead by yelpies. The American cheddar cheese was also unnecessary. There was also some weird-ketchup looking ingredient. I don't recall the menu saying American-Japanese fusion burger. Carrot tasted as if it was undergoing decomposition. If the sandwich was made fresh, perhaps it would taste better.","The owner is really friendly, but i guess the sandwich just like any regular beef sandwich. Nothing special.","Ordered a ""matcha latte"" -- 99% milk, 1% matcha powder. Can't believe I paid like $5 to drink iced milk. Not to mention unfriendly service from a guy who seemed to be the owner. Was excited to get matcha latte in this neighborhood, but this place is a skip.","This little inconspicuous and unpretentious gem is located off Roosevelt Ave in the bustling area of Jackson Heights.  The neighborhood is already littered with an array of tasty food options ranging from Pupusas, Himalayan, Colombian and Thai- and so many ""other"" distractions - however 969 Coffee boasts unassuming sushi and, yes, coffee. Hard to spot amidst the neighborhood clutter? Yes. Worth it? Definitely.  It's small, cozy and frankly I'm surprised I don't come here more often. The food selection is on the limited side however extremely satisfactory and all you need for lunch on a sweltering Monday afternoon apparently. Their onigiri rolls are simply divine and satisfy the soul. I had a chicken and avocado roll with a side of seaweed salad w/edamame. It was light, clean and refreshing. Other options include sushi, prepackaged ramen and various treats/sweets and, oh, Joe The Art of Coffee?! This place is full of little surprises. Do try their teas!","The owner is very nice and you can tell he cares about remembering the customers who stop in.Also, the store is cute and small but has a decent amount of seating for its size (both inside and out). They also carry Japanese snacks such as chips, drinks, and ice cream/mochi. I got the spicy chicken onigiri which wasn't what I expected. It wasn't spicy and the meat was kinda hard. I expected the chicken to be more of a shredded consistency but what I got was kinda like marinated, oversauteed tiny chicken chunks covered in some kinda sauce. The owner was nice and offered me a fork to eat it though. Also it's shaped like a heart and they too it with what I believe is Sriracha mayo and yuzu sauce (??) and fried onions which added a nice crunch.I also bought a large iced matcha latte, lightly sweetened which tasted alrighty. Overall not bad.","I wish small, savory snacks were more prevalent. Pizza's great, and it usually hits the spot when I want a savory snack, but so often I crave an empanada, a couple of dumplings and definitely onigiri. I just want variety, and 969 delivers. I noticed ramen and sushi on their menu and I can't speak to the quality of those items, but I absolutely love their onigiri. If you're not familiar, onigiri is sushi rice and some kind of protein wrapped in seaweed. In east Asia you can find onigiri at your local 7 Eleven and it is great. My favorite at 969 is one made with breaded white fish, avocado and American cheese. American Cheese is the ultimate guilty pleasure for me and it pairs amazingly well with the components of this onigiri.I also had an avocado milkshake topped with a scoop of black sesame ice cream. So good! Can't wait to return when I'm craving a small savory snack.",969 NYC Coffee
83,"The cashier lady might need some customer service training. Went in to get takeout, she couldn't even have the courtesy to stay focused on my order for 5 minutes. Kept on waving and saying hello to the whole world while I had to repeat my order to her several times. Told me not to linger by counter to wait for my takeout while I'd seen white guys in the past happily hanging there with no issues.  Now you'd imagine her to bring me my food when the order is done. Instead she left my order there when I clearly was sitting at the waiting bench area the whole time. Wasted a good 30 minutes of my time sitting there while my food was just there all along. Can't figure how hard it was for her to show some effort at least get the waiters to come inform me or just bring over my food. Very irritating experience to say the least. Not happy with such lazy attitude.","The food is okay, nothing special. Similar food taste can be easily found in downtown flushing. I'd say food is 4 stars.Service is 0 star for our visit. This is the only restaurant where I have to ASK for water (we finished half of the dishes and water still didn't arrive). There're 4 of us, and even after I asked ""can we have some iced water?"" the waiter only gave us 1 glass of water. The waiters were so busy that we felt completely neglected.","Finally, a hong kong style, authentic wonton noodle soup joint with delicious shrimp wontons that has whole pieces.  They also have the usual dishes found in HK style cafes like rice rolls, fried cruellers, curry squid, pig skin, and fish balls. Haven't tried the pan fried noodles or fried rice dishes yet but the way the service and food are, it gives me more of a reason to come back.",Excellent service and the food is excellent.All items on menu brings back memories of HK. Very nice decor for a cha chan tang (tea house).Would recommend this place for authentic Hong Kong flavor .,"So delicious! Great spot that gets busy on weekend nights so reserve ahead or go on a weekday. It's comfort HK food and I'd travel 20-30 mins to get here. They have great ""bo jai fons"" which are the rice casserole pots. They have different styles like pork ribs or salted pork and egg - the best part is the crunchy rice at the bottom :)Milk tea is spot on, fried buns with condensed milk is delicious and homey, and their noodles are fresh. The curry has great taste. Service is great too - they're nice and friendly.","We came here after reading about it in an Eater article and were pretty satisfied with our meal. We ordered cheung fun, scallion pancake, beef brisket curry over rice, beef brisket noodle soup, and clay pot rice.The cheung fun is good, but it is a little bit too chewy for my liking. I tend to like cheung fun best when it's freshly steamed and the rice noodle is almost able to unfold itself. The scallion pancake, however, is another story. It is barely a scallion pancake, and you can tell that it has been frozen and microwaved because it was overly buttery and soggy. If you order it expecting a crispy, flaky scallion pancake, you will be disappointed. That being said, if you eat it like roti, it is PERFECT dipped into the beef brisket curry. The beef brisket curry over rice was delicious -- easily my favorite thing we ordered. It's a bit spicy and sooo beautifully flavored. The beef brisket was wonderfully tender, too.The spare rib clay pot rice is pretty standard, not much to say about it. The spare ribs are pretty good and were somehow on the border of sweet and savory.The beef noodle soup is also good, and the beef is perfectly tender.One thing I will say is that the serving sizes here are smaller than your average Cantonese restaurant. I'm used to family-sized portions that you pass around the table, but this is not one of those restaurants. The entrees are more sized for an individual.Overall, I had a good experience here and will return.",Yummy Noodle House 粥麵之家

We attempted to order a drink twice and it never came. Almost no interaction with wait staff ... and we were sitting at the bar. What kind of bartender doesn't make chit chat?!?!,I brought the hubs here for his birthday dinner and left disappointed. We started with amazing fried calamari which were light and crispy. I ordered the burrata salad which was alright just not enough flavor. The hubs asked the waitress about the seafood options and she suggested the whole crispy sea bass instead of the swordfish. Now I wish I was paying attention to the convo but I surely was not. I would have told him not to order the sea bass and to stick with his first choice. When they brought out his entree he was a bit in shock so I said just try it. He tried it and was pulling scales from his mouth. I wanted him to send it back but he felt bad. Not as bad as me!!! This was his birthday dinner and he was upset and so was I. They really should take that entree off the menu and replace it with grouper or a sea bass fillet. Plus they fill your cup up with mostly ice and charge you $2.75 for a seltzer and then guess what? Your still thirsty and ask for more and another charge. Not impressed.,So elated the finest fish establishment in Queens is back to serving tremendous old fashioned greatness (seafood)Not inexpensive but the awesome fare is well worth it,"Wow the best seafood in Queens ( for that matter all of NYC) unfortunately I ate in this fine establishment this afternoon for lunch and I was totally disappointed. I absolutely love this place but they left me wanting more. I made the pilgramicdge to this seafood staple and ended up disappointed. I was looking for the old standby ""Lobster Roll""  and was told that lobster prices are too expensive for the menu and that unfortunately,  for the last few months it's not available. I personally found this excuse unacceptable. On a positive note the bartender and the clam shucker were extremely positive,friendly and apologetic. A place of this qualifier ty and legendary food and service deserves a little better.","I've been coming to this restaurant since I was a kid, back in the 1980s, when my mom would bring me, and now as an adult, I bring myself (and sometimes my mom) here for some of the freshest and best selection of seafood in Queens.When you first walk in, you can see the beautiful open display of all the fresh fish and seafood available that day. If you go to the bar, you can see the list of freshly harvested oysters and clams which changes quite frequently.My usual visit here consists of me sitting at the bar, ordering and eating a few dozen different oysters, a cup of either their famous New England clam chowder or soup of the day, which is always fresh and delicious. This past visit, there was a corn and crab chowder that was outstanding! Then I order and eat some more seafood, sometimes the lump crab, sometimes the tuna tartare, sometimes the tuna tacos, all of which are excellent Choices. Are usually wash all of this down with a glass or an entire bottle of whichever wine, Danielle the bartender recommends. There are some great  wines, found on their extensive wine list.They also have a lunch special for $21 which includes an appetizer and an entrée. It is also worth asking what seasonal seafood is available, as they usually have something off the menu that is worth ordering.",London Lennie's
85,"Unassuming brunch spot in the middle of a shopping complex that's easy to miss. Saturday morning and no reservation needed for two people.Brunch menu is divided into your normal lunch options, crepe options, as well as egg options. Settled on the L'omelette Eloise ($10) to go along with a Bloody Mary ($8). Omelet is a dense portion of eggs accompanied by a side salad. Eggs had a nice mixture of cheese and ham inside, made better with some hot sauce. Salad had a mild vinaigrette on top that was pretty good. Bloody Mary wasn't too strong, as it didn't detract from the main course. Also tried a side of fries ($5?) - fried with the peel on and salted well.Service started off slow then picked up as time went on. Not an easy spot to get to, but worth a stop if in the area.",Went there with my daughter and son.  We ordered burgers with fries and the brie cheese appetizer.  The burgers were cooked just right and that brie cheese appetizer is just exquisite.  This restaurant never ceases to amaze me.,"I wanted to like this place. Heard really good things about their brunch and came here on a Saturday. The place is small but not packed at all.The brunch portions are okay but the presentation's kind of lacking. The waiter was also a little pushy for us to order more things after we finished our drinks and our brunch entrees, like giving a mock disapproving look when I said I'd pass on the dessert. Really? The food was just so-so and I would rather go have a pastry next door (which wasn't all that great but that's another review).","Wonderful meal at this hidden gem tucked away in the corner of a shopping center.    Convenient parking, but reservations recommended!   It was 100 degrees today, but the place was still packed for dinner!   We had the French Onion Soup, Baked Brie, Escargot in Puff Pastry, Duck entree, Coq au Vin, Boeuf Bourignon, and hamburger.   Everything was delicious!   Even the hamburger!!Definitely recommended.   We'll be back for brunch soon!",Cute. Small. intimate. Lovely setting. Nice waiter. Slow service.  Not In a bad way. Relaxed dining. Very nice. Average food.  French onion soup lacks body and flavor. Brie en croute was good with nice salad. Cabernet franc was palatable. Burger was very good. Octopus and chorizo was so-so. No pomme tartin for dessert. Ok evening but no reason to return. Bummer.

86,Customer service was on point. Food was quick and hot. No complaints! Would definitely go here another time!,Their mango sticky rice  I need to come back to try more than just their appetizers and dessert,"Three dishes for $50 and I was still hungry! Ordered red curry veg, app sampler and pad thai tiger prawn (for $22!). I actually got no curry sauce because it was packed in a round flat container that leaked out completely. The appetizer sampler had only one spring roll and a few other tiny things for $13. The rice was not jasmine - just plain white. The pad thai thru Grubhub forced you to pick a meat, even though I wanted vegetarian. There was one giant prawn in it, and when I broke off the head, a lot of liquid goo fell out - gross! I wanted to try something new, but it was not good. Tiny portions, not a lot of flavor and definitely overpriced. Will go back to ordering from Green Lotus, where $35 gets me @4 dishes for two people and tons of leftovers.","If you love authentic, fresh, and delicious Thai food this is the place! It has a very welcoming and inviting ambience.I was recommended by a friends to try this place and she didn't let me down. They have an amazing menu with all of the classics plus some interesting options as well. I started with the drink called Kao-Mook which was so good! Super refreshing with a kick of crushed lychee. I tried several of the appetizers including shrimp donut, the chive pancake, and the slow cooked rips. I would literally drive all the way back to Queens just for this ribs. Such amazing flavor and it literally melted in my mouth. For the main dishes, I had drunken noodle with chicken and stirred fried ground pork with fried egg. Both were so good, it tasted like real street food in Thailand.I will definitely have to come back and try some of the other tantalizing options!","Pretty tasty Thai food. Excellent service. We ordered the sup sampler as an appetizer, I had the Chiang Mai curry noodle soup and my husband had the Bangkok crab meat noodles with soup on the side. - Sup Sampler: I love the availability of the sup sampler at a very fair cost which allows first timers as well as indecisive people to be able to try a little bit of a majority of their appetizers. While the portion is small it is sufficient for 2-3 people to share and have just a taste. There were four different items on the tray: 2 pieces spring rolls, 4 chive pancakes, 2 steamed chicken and shrimp dumplings (siu mai) and 3 fried crab dumplings. Two sauces were provided as well. I thought the appetizers were just okay. - Chiang Mai Curry Noodle Soup: Strong, tasty broth with a nice kick. The one chicken leg was very tender. Nice contrast with the fried egg noodles with the soft. It is a well executed dish but nothing special. - Bangkok Crab Meat Noodles: This can be ordered dry or with soup. We ordered it with soup on the side so we can have best of both worlds. I noticed some reviews say this is bland but I happen to love the subtlety of this dish. It actually is my favorite of the three things we had ordered. Unique. They seem to have a great selection of desserts. I would also love to try the blue coconut rice in the future as well if we ever come back.","Pro:-Food: authentic and tastes great. Hard to find a good Thai place around Bayside but my husband and I finally found one. -Causal atmosphere: Not too run down, not too fancy. Con:I really can't think of any...",Sup Thai Kitchen
87,"Had the chicken sandwich, it was one of the worst I've ever had. Super overcooked and was missing several ingredients.The waiter was also super rude. Gave us some pretty aggressive comments before we even ordered. I didnt send back my sandwich because I was worried about how the waiter would react because he was such a jerk.",I didn't eat there so can't score any higher or lower. Great cocktails. Loved the basil drink. Gave a 3 for the shitty bar stools that were way too low for bar level and kills your neck if you want to watch the game. Sit in one of the booths with the cut up cushions and you'll get a better view.,"If you are in the area already then come here for a drink. Don't go out of your way, and don't come here for food. The food is abysmal. The service is friendly, but very absent and the waitress missed out on a few extra drinks on the order.","As much as I love Manhattan, there are weekends where I don't want to deal with crowded bars and music so loud I need to scream to chat with someone right in front of me. The astorian nails this requirement right on the money! I went to this bar with a group of cousins and we had a blast! The indoor atmosphere was awesome. Highly recommend this place if you're ever looking to take a date somewhere . Their drinks and apps were made to perfection. The drink menu is massive, so definitely take your time ordering. It's also really easy to pass time here since they have a projector showing classic movies upstairs.","Drinks: The drinks were good, and tasty. It didn't wow, but I have their drinks again. I had the hibiscus mistress and the opuntia daiquiri. Hibiscus mistress was a good ginger drink of you love ginger beer, but it didn't have enough hibiscus to warrant its misleading name. The opuntia daiquiri was not truly a daiquiri, although the menu makes it appear as a Hemingway daiquiri with a twist. It is not. I did enjoy the herbaceous sage flavor.Food. I had the hot wings. And they were some of the worst wings that I ever had. The batter did not adhere to the skin and constantly fell off. The skin was soggy and disgusting. The sauce lacked flavor. And the wings were huge. The wings were so big that I was not able to enjoy them as normal-sized wings, they made huge mess, and you would have to try to break and cut them. In addition. In addition, true huge wings were put on a tiny plate so they almost fell off the plate and would increase the mess while eating. Service: Inconsistent at best. One bartender was pleasant. He was friendly and gave you that good neighborhood bar feel. The other was rude and abrupt to everyone at the bar. She also mixed up orders at time, I had a burger sent to me that I did not order.Will I give them another chance? I'm not sure. Maybe just for drinks?","My husband and I tried this bar for dinner around 6pm on Friday. Although we would have had to share the rest of my our table, we didn't mind and nobody ended up sitting down so we had it to ourselves for the entire meal. Didn't have to wait for the seats at all. The back garden is beautiful and features a retractable roof so you can still sit out there in the winter. I got their daiquiri and although on the small side, it was very tasty and refreshing, just like the menu said. Having had a late lunch, I just had their whiskey pickle plate and it was so good. Spicy! You get pickles (of course), but you also get pickled cauliflower, carrots, daikon, and cherry peppers. It was a full plate. My husband got the shrimp po-boy special. He said it was really good. The fries were so good. They have the skins on still and that is my absolute favorite. Our server was incredibly nice and was very attentive and funny. All in all is was a good experience and I will definitely go back again.",The Astorian
88,"I've been here long ago and their food has remained consistently good. Upon my latest visit, the restaurant ran out of bread. Went for the Vegan Paella instead, and I wasn't disappointed. (Very large portion too). Service was fair. My biggest gripe was the restaurant smelling like vomit! I noticed the smell when I walked in, but it kind of subsided as I walked to the back. I soon realized the smell was due to the nasty rag they are wiping down the tables with. Holy sh*t, when they cleaned the table next to me, I wanted to throw up!","This review would have been five stars because of the good food but I gave it a three because of the poor service! I visited for the first time this weekend based off a friend's recommendation. The water glasses were extremely dirty and had lipstick stains on them. After we asked to have our glasses replaced, the waiter seemed to forget about us and we didn't get a glass of water until 20 mins after. Then we noticed one of the knives on the table had jelly on it. So either they are not washing the dishes properly or the table wasn't properly inspected before we sat but either way we were over it at this point. We were served our food (which was good) but our waiter did not check on us not once while there. For a first experience, the service was poor. Don't know if I would return again.","IN THE BEGINNINGI used to Love this place they had very good food, cheep prices and delicious frozen Sangria. I was a recurring customer for a while I would be in there every other 2 weeks, which is nuts because I live in Staten Island so making that drive just for food means that I really like it. My first couple experiences here were great! The food tasted fresh and the staff was so friendly and outgoing and that's what I normally look for in a restaurant. I would always go in and have the skirt steak dish and my fiancé would have the Lomo slatado.WHEN IT STOPPED BEING A GOOD EXPERIENCE So I would say about my 5th time here things weren't as good. At this point my fiancé and I had a routine where we would order our favorite dishes. This time the meal was Okay, it didn't taste as as good for some reason not sure why we just remembered we weren't as satisfied. We just wrote off this experience because we know that every restaurant has its bad days. We would continue returning and the experience just kept getting worst, the food wasn't as good and the staff weren't as friendly. I have a 3 strike system where after 3 strikes I just never come back and don't recommend the place.THE 3RD STRIKE AND MY LAST NIGHT AT BLENDBack in May, my fiancé decided to bring me here for my birthday because she know I love frozen sangrias. I was a little skeptical at first because the last couple of times but they hadn't received my last strike so I agreed. We were served by the server that took our table the last four times. He isn't very social and kinda just walks up to your table to take your order and that's it. That made the experience less enjoyable. So we went on and did our routine and order our normal dishes. The chicharones de pollo had a weird flavor this time, I couldn't put my finger on it. It just didn't taste right. Next came out our Lomo Saltado which came out pretty cold, i remember taking my first bite and the steak was pretty cold almost as if they just defrost it. The dish wasn't hot at all and the steak tasted old. It was just gross and I couldn't being myself to eat the whole dish. Next my fiancé ordered the chocolate cake with a birthday candle which was supposed to come warm, but it wasn't. The server literally grabbed the plate and plopped it right in front of me, didn't say ""happy birthday"", didn't play a birthday song and just walked away. It was the worst birthday dinner I've ever had in my life!!!My fiancé and I own a restaurant by the way so we always leave a good tip because we know server struggles. I've brought my family here so many time so the fact that they can't even remember who you are is sad. This place lost my business, my respect, and my recommendations. I don't recommend for anyone to bother with this place it's lost its touch and the service is horrible.",Got there with five couples no reservations because the other blend on the water frontMessed up our reservationThe service the drinks the food everything was great give them-five stars will recommend all my friends,"I took my boyfriend here for the first time and I have never seen him eat so fast! I think he's hooked on the well seasoned chicken!  We both had the pollo a la plancha (I think I'm spelling it correctly). The best food and service! Rico was very professional, attentive and friendly. He took the time to chat with us and stopped by our table to make sure we were good. I come to Blend at least 3-5x per year and always have great service and food!","We got there a little late, but they were accommodating since it wasn't packed. The hostess said after ten minutes they do give away the table usually so FYI. This restaurant is small compared to Blend on the Water. I accidentally made reservations here even though I wanted Blend on the Water. Oops. However, The decor was cool, light up menus and looks like event space or something since there was a big screen. To drink my husband had the frozen Sangria. He loved it and he said it was strong. Since I couldn't drink, They made me a virgin coconut mojito which was yummy. For appetizers we had the mofongo with beef and chicken and beef empanadas. My husband was ok with the mofongo but I didn't like it. Nothing like authentic Puerto Rican mofongo. If you know the difference, pass. If you don't try it and see what you think. The empanadas were good. I'd get those again. For entrees we ordered the churrasco and the ropa vieja both were good,We recommend. They both come with white rice and black beans. My husband ordered tostones, he liked them; said they were thin. He just said he preferred the garlic oil they give was on the side rather than poured on top. The presentation of the dishes were pretty. We are married so this is a good date spot for us with Latin music playing and ppl talking. If your looking forQuiet romantic setting this won't work lol",Blend
89,"I'm actually a little confused as to why this restaurant boasts almost five stars. There is nothing remotely Mexican or authentic about the food here. We tried quite a few items on the menu in search of authentic flavor and everything fell flat. Service was okay but the food definitely does not hit the marks. I hardly ever give negative feedback & would gladly put a positive review if the experience met expectations. I'm not sure who is writing reviews or if past patrons ever actually tried good Mexican food. I'm sorry to say but I cannot rate this experience more than 2 stars. I guess Jackson Heights it is next time for me! I wanted to like this place so badly, sadly it didn't work out that way. You know you're in the wrong place when they can't even get a quesadilla right, such a bizarre experience.. left me feeling super disappointed.","This is a seamless delivery order. First, they have some nerve having a 120 minute delivery window, if that is the amount of time you require, you shouldn't offer delivery, and at the very least, you should deliver within that window 100% of the time.At the very least, when your 2 hour order is late, you should pick up the phone.Appalling. Will never order again. Seamless refunded at least.","Done with this place. You place a Seamless order and they take forever. By the time my food was delivered it was cold. The tacos were so greasy they kept falling apart, every bite was running to wash my hands and rinse my lips because there was so much grease. I ate as much as I could because I was starving, but couldn't get through the whole meal because of the grease ... and the food was f-ing cold! Never again.",Easily the best pork chops I've had. The Tacos and Margaritas are effin' amazing and authentic. The decor of the place is funky and yet cozy. Service is great but place can get packed on weekend brunches. They've gained a fan in me.,"Petty policies turned a couple cheerleaders into vocal critics.We've been to Fresco's many times for their drag brunch and have been big supporters of an LGBT owned enterprise. The show is great and food is delicious but the service is mediocre (and has automatic gratuity) and management has decided that it makes sense to fine people when their whole reservation doesn't show. We had a table for 6 and had two flake and were charged an extra $40 (plus tax lol). While this is disclosed when the reservation was made, I've never seen them enforce it before. I could totally see if the entire reservation was a no-show and really thought that was what it was for but to charge a group of 4 because they were not a group of 6 is kind of ridiculous. Haven't business owners learned yet not to punish loyal customers?? I guess the owner of Fresco's still needs to learn that lesson. Trust that we will not be back again and that we'll tell everyone we talk to not to go there.",Drag brunch and a hot daddy making tacos! Worth the stop and panty drop!The food is delicious!Gay pride is celebrated here! Love it!,Fresco's Cantina
90,"In the mood for Caribbean food, so popped in and ordered food (TO GO) to take back to the hotel. Was VERY clear about order, even repeated it several times to the Manager, who happened to work the register. SHE STILL DID NOT PLACE THE ORDER CORRECTLY for the Oxtail plate, which she confirmed came standard with rice & peas, steamed cabbage and one plantain. Ordered a SIDE (extra) of Mac & Cheese. Got to the room, opened the container, and NO rice and peas or plantain, only two cabbage leafs and a big chuck of Mac & Cheese-all poorly packaged. Only left a few minutes go, and the manager at first pretended she did not remember the order, and then finally admitted she did. She offered a side of rice and peas for a future order. NO THANKS. One chance for a good impression. Not a fan of attitude and bad service.",I've heard about the buffet here for some time and finally decided to check it out. Based on some complaints about crowds and disappointment of when it ends I called and was told it's from 10-3 so I arrived at 1030 and was seated about ten min later. For such a reasonable price I was very satisfied with the food. The service is mediocre but it's not a huge place so I imagine the staff isn't that big so they are very busy especially on a Sunday. Arrive early do you don't feel rushed or miss anything. Every item I had was tasty and well seasoned which is surprising for a buffet. I would def return to try the seafood night.,"I always get Chicken soup. Today they only had broth and wanted to charge me full price still. If I'm not getting chicken, vegetables and dumpling, why am I being charged full price. As a fellow Caribbean our people really need to work on customer service. Horrid.","The Door has been a fixture in this area almost forever.  The food is amazing.   Service for the sit down dining is amazing the staff is very hospitable, courteous, and extremely polite.  Now the take outside is another story you get the wrong server and you might get dropped(LOL).   Tough crowd gets tough service, I get it.  This is my go to when I want for authentic Jamaican cuisine. You must try this place.","Great Caribbean food, amazing staff. Went at 5pm on a Thursday, and the place was positively packed, but also managable. The mood in the room was like a big family wedding- everybody was happy to be there. We decided to eat from the buffet, and it was outstanding. The table next to us ordered off the menu, and their food looked wonderful,  especially the whole fish. Our waitstaff was just the right amount of attentiveness, helpful and kind. They took very good care of us- especially Winston. My favorite dish off the buffet was the curry chicken; I wanted an entire soup bowl full of that broth. But every other item I tried was just as good. The whole fried shrimp was perfectly spicy. The crab was cooked precisely with a steam table hold in mind, very juicy and full of flavor. And of course, they had perfectly fried plantains to counter the heat. Looking forward to eating here again.",This is not your typical Jamaican/Caribbean restaurant. Let me start off by saying I love the decor. The bright Caribbean essences of color illuminated the place. The superb customer service was out of this world. I myself was in awe. The variety of Carribbean cusinie for brunch on a Saturday was such an elated surprise for my taste buds. Oh let's not forget the Christian soothing music myself and mother thoroughly enjoyed. I walked in happy and left on cloud #20. This establishment deserve a 10 star rating. Whatever you guys are doing please keep it up. I definitely have a place to eat when I visit NY again.,The Door
91,Tiny store front in Flushing. LONG ASS WAIT TIME.Pros:- Amazing brown sugar milk tea- Looks good on instagramCons- Long wait,"Waited a ~10 min line on a saturday afternoon. Was pretty good, but i wouldn't wait anything more than 10min because its not like the drink was irreplaceable with other bbt. Also make sure you specify which kind of bubble you want - because we ended up with the combo and had both small AND regular boba..and i am not a fan of the small ones.","I understand the hype for this but I do not believe this is worth the wait. I came here because I knew I had to try it to see how it compares to the other places with the black sugar boba. The wait was approximately an hour and the drink, terrible. There was MINIMAL flavor. I was disappointed. The ordering process was ridiculous. One person is allowed to order two drinks max, no matter if you're with a few other people and just want to order together. I  opulent understand why they couldn't just ring us up all at once. It was just 3 people..Not to mention, I was trying to get this prior and had called in earlier to see what time they close, in which they replied 9:30PM. Great, right? Called them again at 9 to see if they could do a phone order because my friends and I were 5 minutes away and was unfortunately told that they were CLOSED. Huh? Your hours were confirmed for until 9:30PM but you're closed at 9. Interesting. Then I read a review that once they sold out, they close which is understandable but they could have said something along the lines to that.",Yum!!! I love getting boba and pearl with cream milk tea. You get two different sizes of boba for some variety. I feel like they changed the cup size to a smaller size?!? Let me know if I am right.,"we have waited so long to get a bubble tea. Not worst it, it's too sweet and bubble is so hard.Do not feel different with others. But always see they have very long wait line. So want to try once, but did feel anything different for waiting half hour to get a couple of drink","I don't remember the last time I stood in line to wait for boba but this place has a crowd at all times of the day! Their most famous drink, the brown sugar boba with cream mousse, is very insta worthy but has a very peculiar recipe - simply milk and brown sugar with no tea. The boba and pearls were soft and chewy but the drink itself was extremely heavy as expected and interestingly tasted like milk tea even though there was no tea inside. I didn't really feel top notch after having this and felt somewhat sleepy afterward, which usually happens whenever I eat or drink something unnaturally fattening..it's worth a try if one has never had brown sugar boba but it's really a one and done deal for me.",Tiger Sugar
92,Their food was okay with really cheap price but it was really dirty. Their floor was sticky and leftover on the table everywhere... my friend felt bad with her stomach the next day.,"I had eaten here 2-3 times before but I could not form an opinion till today.  It's definitely cheap.  For as low as $6.50, one gets a big bowl of freshly hand-pulled noodle, stir fried or in broth.  And they really do give ample amount of noodle!  The menu selections are fun and enticing.  The value proposition is definitely there,  and I can see why the locals keep coming back and where the rave reviews come from.But that's all the good things I can say about this place.  The divey setup at the ordering counter, and the self-help communal tables remind me of the street hawker setup at night markets in Asia -- not so hygienic.  One would be tempted to sit down because of the lure of the food, but at the same time wary of the risk of getting sick as a result of downplaying the possible lack of hygiene.  Well, I had been lucky before but finally met my fate today.  I had the Lamb Mixed Hand Drawn Noodle Soup and a couple of pot stickers for lunch.  One of the two dishes caused my stomach cramps so bad that I had to make 2 emergency stops during my 3 hour drive back to PA.  Eat at your own risk!  For me, getting sick once is more than enough.",I don't think anything can beat an order of steamed dumplings with beef hand-pulled noodle soup and an ice cold slush or bubble tea from across at QUICKLY store. But you gotta be able to compromise with the appearance of the dining space.,"The five star rating is for the Ma La Tang (spicy soup with a variety of vegetables and noodles). The flavor is perfect for me, the best I've had in New York so far. We live nearby and order out whenever we're too lazy to cook. It still taste very good when you heat up the next day and add extra veggies to the broth. In terms of other dishes:I've had the dumpling which is soggy because they prepare them and cover in a heating pan, so the skin is not crispy. The meat side dishes are delicious. I usually get the pig stomach/tripes. They're flavorful and cheap compared to many places.The hand pulled noodles are delicious as well, but I recommend eating it there so it's fresh and hot. When you order take out, they will separate the noodles and soup so the noodles don't get soggy when you get home.","My wife and I ate pork fried dumplings (item 1 on the menu). The dumplings were large (about four bites) but my wife refused to eat more than half of them because she said that they were not fresh. She said that they were old. We were there just after lunch, around 1:30 PM. I thought they tasted pretty good and were juicy. She is a cook and can tell subtle things that I do not pick out.We ordered at the counter, then had to pick up our order when it was ready. The prices are good. It was warm inside and could have used some air conditioning. There is no restroom for diners.The diner is better off, eating dumplings elsewhere.","Boom bam. Hiding under the tracks of an el train in queens, some of the finest dumplings and soup one can find.Wonton hand pulled noodle soup is piled high with both noodles and dumplings in a delicate broth. Sesame sauce hand pulled noodles is a bowl of noodles with half a jar or sesame paste dumped on top - not the greatest dish on the menu unless sesame thick sauce is really your thing.Pork and leek fried dumplings amazingly thin dumpling wrappers enclosing moist, juicy, fatty balls of tender seasoned meat ($2.75/8). A great deal and some of the best in town.Hand pulled noodles with pork has a bit of kick but manageable for those not enthralled with heat. Tender pork is nestled in a pile of noodles and broth.Order at the window, get a number And find a table if you're lucky.",Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House
93,"Why would you doubt that I've been to Addictive? The food was bland, the wine was cheap and the seafood was obviously canned. The owners are very nice visited our table and shook our hands as we left but we wasted $100.","This is the worst restaurant in Jackson Heights. Don't be fooled by the positive reviews. You might as well burn your money or go for ""the experience"".","Overall the food & drinks were good (we had the Black Duck & Sauvignon blanc). Service was good, although they forgot one of our orders, but was rectified quickly. Space was a little tight, tables too close to each other, but my main complaint is that they have paper napkins! For the type of food they're serving & the atmosphere, they should splurge a little bit on cloth napkins.","Amazing place, elegant and understated.  Would fit right in if it were in Manhattan.  We arrived late for a reservation because of traffic, and because I hate being late for reservations, phone ahead to apologize.  We were assured that that our reservation would still be honored and, lo and behold, it was.  My wife and I were celebrating our 27th anniversary together and, because we had our 13-year-old son with us, asked to sit at a slightly larger table for 4 because we didn't want to disturb the other patrons who were already seated nearby. The tapas were amazing, beautifully presented and delicious, and we were given samples of wine before we settled on a bottle.  Our main server was always at hand, which made the experience easier for our 13-year-old, who was unaccustomed to a restaurant of this type but who loved dipping bread into olive oil.  Dessert was excellent as well.  Would have loved to speak to either of the owners, who are currently in Italy, but we do plan to return for another experience in the future.  Highly recommended.","Decide to write a review while still experiencing the joy of a new discovery.Always a new phrase ""don't judge a book by its cover"", but who knew that behind the modest and demure facade hidden true European paradise. You walk in and being surrounded by an unusual selection of music. Decor has been though out to tiny details. Service was outstanding. Looks like they know what you want and they can read your mind. Wine selection exited my expectation. First I have Arrocero Blend, Valencia, and for the end of my course Sin Palabras 2017 Albarino, Rias Baixas. Food was very good and joy, joy, joy!!!The only recommendation, water. Chlorine kills the taste of all... I'm sure place like yours can afford filters or offer a variety of water. Do I recommend this place? Yes! I will be coming quite often now since it's in my neighborhood.","This place is a gem!  I walked in and was greeted warmly by a friendly and accommodating hostess. The decor/ambiance was warm and rustic/Mediterranean. I told the hostess I was waiting for my daughter and would have a glass of wine at the bar while I waited. She gave me the extensive wine menu and talked a little about the wine menu. My Tempranillo was excellent we sat down and chose our plates of chorizo, meatballs and a shrimp dish. The chorizo and shrimp dishes were sooooo good. The meatballs were good. All the while the service was attentive but not smothering. Never once did I have to seek out my server. The chocolate cake was sooo fresh and the cappuccino coffees were also excellent. Great service, impeccably clean, fresh food to die for, and a really cool bathroom. What else can you ask for? A very positive dining experience. I will be back. I don't give 5 stars very often.PS. It is a Wine and Tapas restaurant.  The portions are perfect for tapas. And the wine pours are generous!! If you want to walk out in a food coma then go to a northern Italian restaurant on the north shore of Long Island.",Addictive Wine and Tapas Bar
94,"Always excited to try a new ramen shop in Long Island City, I visited Mu Ramen after reading about the NYTimes article and subsequent popup closing, reopening and relocation.A one-star review may seem harsh, but I feel it's necessary to reflect my frustration with the restaurant. Considering that the place is called 'Mu Ramen,' I deemed it most appropriate to try its ramen, though they seem to be popular for their $19 burger (because having an overpriced burger somehow instantaneously makes restaurants relevant these days). The spicy miso ramen's pork-based broth was entirely undetectable, but not so much as was the flavor of miso. While it was sufficiently spicy, the flavor of a tonkotsu broth was entirely absent, as was even the umami bomb offered by so many superior ramen joints in the area.Upon receiving the bill for my $19 bowl of spicy miso ramen, for which I did not request any add-ons or toppings, I was charged an additional $2.50 for the egg. This brought the total to $21.50 before tax and tip. Before I knew it, I had just paid $25 for a bowl of mediocre ramen, and to top it all off - they don't take card! I was hastily pointed to an ATM in the corner of the restaurant to cover this straight-up exorbitant bill.Save yourself the money and trouble - opt for a comparably flavorful meal at the deli/grocery next door. They sell Nongshim microwave ramen for $1.50.","Hard to recognize. It has a red lantern out front and a Japanese character on the door.Surprisingly popular around 9p on a Tuesday. We didn't have reservations, but were able to be seated at the bar.Honestly, I'd go back for the U&I appetizer alone! It was warm and flavorful and the ingredients complemented one another so well! Warning: maybe the most expensive thing on the menu (MP).Other than that:(I forget what this was called on the menu) fried chicken leg - D (too salty and greasy, not worth $8)Tonkotsu ramen - A- (Pork was thick and juicy; egg was just slightly more raw than normal, which I didn't enjoy)PS this place is CASH ONLY! But they have an atm machine inside. Also the menu seems to change up quite often.",The ramen here is delicious but the service seem to get worse with every visit. This time the server was rushing us out. Can I at least finish eating the food that I paid for. Service is trash.,"Cute restaurant in LIC. Although expensive, the U&I listed as MP was about $30 when we went, was absolutely delicious! The flavors blended so well together that it's an explosion in your mouth. No joke. Mussels were also a delight! Their ramen is definitely interesting since I am not use to udon like noodles for ramen. This was their choice of noodle in the spicy miso ramen. I had the tonkotsu ramen which had the regular ramen noodle. Both were good however the size is definitely on the smaller end. To this day, I think I still prefer the ramen at Mitsuwa.PSA: Cash Only!","Tonight was my last night of a 2800 mile culinary road trip, and being in NYC I need to cross off Mu Ramen on the ramen list! I got sucked into this location with its eclectic and at times over the top menu choices such as fois gras stuffed chicken wings, uni dish and wagyu beef hand rolls.We were a four top which allowed a wide range of dishes at the table.I asked not to be rushed and specifically requested that our waitress hold off firing our mains until we had finished all of our apps ( we had many in front of us ) which she agreed to do and and made a point of telling us that it was not a problem! I should of simply ordered our apps to insure we would not be bombarded with 12 covers at the table but that just what happened and it really was infuriating.The dishes were the savior of the meal: our U & I uni dish was delicate fresh and brine and paired well with the roe it came with, our OKONOMIYAKI scallion pancake was a riff on blinis and caviar in its presentation but the flavor profile was subtle and flavorful, our dry aged wagyu ribeye hand rolls were deconstructed in presentation and the tartare missed the mark in flavor and texture, and finally our stuffed chicken wings stuffed with fois gras and brioche, well this one was my biggest disappointment as one could easily say it had more brioche then fois. The fry batter was pedestrian at best no color or seasoning! The wings were cooked perfectly tender. They were large full wings but we were hard pressed to find the fois which appeared to be sparingly placed under the skin rather than truly stuffed. They could of done a better job on those. They sounded grand but I would hold on to your $ on that one.   Our 3 ramens broths ( Tonkotsu, 2 spicy miso ) were on point. Each bowl was creamy, had depth of flavor and was presented well, I was taken a back to see that udon noodles were used in the spicy miso and soba were used in the Tonkotsu?? Since no description was made on the menu, I would've like to have known that!CONCLUSION:Location was easy to find, reservations secured a good table, very small venue, noise level was moderate, staff was fair at best. Food was fair to good at times. One visit was enough after getting sucked into the hype.","I ordered the duck broth ramen and it was alright. The soup was a bit salty but wasn't anything special. The foie gras chicken wings were good though.For the quality of food, I don't think it was worth the wait. The place is so small, and everyone's squished together on large tables. You can get better ramen elsewhere.",Mu Ramen
95,"My husband and I came here a few months ago for dinner as it was highly recommended by several people. Upon waking in, we were greeted by the loudest woman I have ever encountered behind the bar. The place is small and we were able to get a table for two. The entire time, the bartender was SO loud that my husband and I couldn't even talk or think. I kept telling him that I wanted to leave! She then came up to our table to take out order. We ordered food and then I ordered a drink. She refused to serve me because I accidentally forgot my ID. I would have went back to my apartment to get it, if it wasn't a 15 min walk away. We left because we already were not having a good time since all we heard was a woman talking so loudly that it made our ears ring. This is not a place to go to if you want to have a conversation or be able to even think when eating. I can't say I wouldn't give them another chance, but the level of noise from that one worker was just too much for us","My husband and I have been meaning to come here for the mussels.  Since we are moving within the next month, we are trying to knock things off the Forest Hills bucket list.  We've been to DP other times, but only for beers at the bar.Overall, the mussels were disappointing. The mussels are what this place is known for and they just missed the mark. They were on the verge of rubbery and overly salted (yes, mussels are naturally salty WHY ADD MORE?).  I am sad to say that the mussels just missed the mark. DP doesn't offer happy hour specials either which I assume is because they are a small business - WAIT, did you know they were a small business? because they freakin' plaster it everywhere. The table service was pretty unfriendly/ not attentive. I understand this is a dive bar and not a 5 Michelin star restaurant, but just for the time I'm seated - pretend that you want me to be there.",Went on a late Sunday afternoon after seeing good reviews. Busy with only two servers and had to wait forever for service. And while the price was right for brunch with drinks the food was so-so.,"This is my ABSOLUTE favorite restaurant in all of Queens and possibly beyond! I first discovered them on Yelp in 2016, I have since then become a frequent diner and try to make an appearance at least 2-3 times a month because it is just too damn good! It is right in the center of Station Square in Forest Hills so it is conveniently located next to the LIRR and a quick, 2 block walk from the E,F,R,M subway lines.The space itself is small but they make the most with what they have to work with. They have a full bar area with some high-tops in the front, with more tables towards the back of the restaurant for people looking to sit down and eat. In the Summer months, they have 4-5 tables outside which makes for a fantastic dining experience. The restaurant is typically always crowded, which sometimes requires a wait because they don't take reservations. When there are concerts going on at Forest Hills Stadium this place is THE SPOT to pre and post-game at. They will sometimes set up fencing to create a kind of 'beer garden'-esque area out front to provide more room for standing.They do not offer happy hour but drinks are reasonably priced for the area and always pack a punch. They make a delicious red and white sangria daily, which seems to be a fan favorite amongst diners. All there beer is bottled and they offer a great selection of different domestic and craft beers.In regards to the food, everything is ALWAYS delicious and made fresh. They are known for their mussels. Best described as a huge portion of shellfish that comes out piping hot in a white wine broth (I eat it with a spoon because it's so good!) and served alongside a heaping basket of freshly made bread. With all of that being said, the real shining star at Dirty's is the incredible waitstaff and the consistency of the food and overall experience. The waitresses are all fantastic and make you feel like family. Jess, Melissa, Pam, Raquel are all incredible in every way. If you are ever in Forest Hills, this is the place to go. It is truly hard to find a spot with as much character and charm as Dirty Pierre's that nails everything a restaurant and bar should.","Bar for the locals and I love it.  I feel like I have finally found my bar in Forest Hills.  I haven't had a chance to try the food yet, but this place is exactly what I have been looking for in the area.  This place is a dive bar/hole in the wall and it is perfect!","For date night I was in charge of chosing where to eat before catching a movie at Midway. I chose DP because I was craving a shrimp quesadilla. Upon entering I was quickly reminded of how small of a restaurant DP really is. We were greeted instantly and were seated within two minutes which was good because I started to feel claustrophobic. My heart was set on the shrimp quesadilla, but I found it strange that it didn't come with your standard salsa and sour cream. Instead it came remoulade. The quesadilla was delicious. The shrimp was fresh and lightly seasoned, but the three cheese blend with the sautéed peppers and onions stole the show. I asked for sour cream and sliced avocado which was an upcharge. My hunny ordered the mussels which seems like a staple at DP. Every other table had a big bowl of it. The aroma from the mussels filled the area which you couldn't help but moan and look over to see who had what. We both ordered coronas. I had mine with grenadine. Everyone is super friendly and personable.",Dirty Pierre's
96,"This is strictly based on service, not on food.  We walked in the restaurant without any reservation.  We were told that the wait time was about 20 mins.  Waited around for over 40 mins and the  inquired about the wait time but did not receive any response.  We don't mind the wait time, but the untruthful disclosure of wait time and unresponsiveness from the staff was unappetizing.","My overall experience here: overpriced, small portions, terrible waiting time. Our friend recommended this place and bought us here last night for the first time. We were a party of 3 and when we initially came, they told us the wait was 45mins and we prepared to wait for that long instead of trying elsewhere. The waiting space is really cramped and there are lots of customers/waiters walking in and out of the narrow aisle we were sitting at and I felt extremely uncomfortable sitting there and people brushing against my leg while passing through. Almost an hour later, we had to ask again when we were getting seated and they said it's looking like another 20mins...and we were like ok. We weren't seated until past 9 and they said 45mins when we came at 7:30. That's double the time they told us...also most of the people that came in after us got seated first. I rather them overestimate than underestimate the time. We also ordered beer to drink while we waited but the waitress asked if we can pay on the spot three times and we said no, because we didn't eat yet and she can just put it on the bill. She got frustrated with us and threw the menu on my lap as she was walking away...Then she returned with coronas and handed it to us without even opening the caps...these aren't twistoffs. We were definitely not happy with her attitude especially since we have been waiting so long. The broth was good but honestly not better than its competitors. The food was so expensive...$13 for 6pc of fish balls, $4 for 3pc of chopped up corn, $5 for 4pc of fish tofu...overpriced for no reason. The bill was $150 for 3 ppl for so little food. I will not come here again due to the bad service and also overpriced food. I would highly recommend friends and family to go to the many other hotpot places with better service/prices/food such as Haidiliao, little sheep or spring.","Used to be 4-5 stars and I am a regular visitor here. (Atleast once a month). I went here last Friday as usual and we arrived around 6pm and was told it was a 45minutes wait for a table of 3. The 45minutes soon became 60mins, 90mins and 2 hours. This was very strange because when we arrived there were not that many tables ahead of us and we soon realized that new arriving tables were getting seated infront of us. A pair of ladies opposite us in the waiting area realized this as well and started complaining. We soon discovered that their staff were letting their friends skip the table waitlist. Hence the long wait.","This is the hotpot place I come to every time I'm in flushing. Great atmosphere, great quality of food and the service is always great. The lamb shoulders and the shrimp pate are my go to. It's slightly pricey, but you pay for the quality.","Fancy hot pot! Meat quality was great, tasty and tender. The bone broth is the best. Bright and clean restaurant. They even sing happy birthday!","We tried to call ahead to make RSVP but we couldn't understand them on the phone. We came right at the diner time, had to wait for over an hour but they always serve us fruits and house drinks in small cups to keep us not leaving I guess. While waiting, we selected what we want to eat. Meats, seafoods, and veggie were super fresh and good.  I recommended the foods on their top list (Wagyu slices, shrimp paste, deluxe seafood tray, abalone, and etc.,).  Broths were good as well, my husband got the medium Szechuan soup and it was spicy spicy.  Not an all you can eat hot pot kind, everything costs $$ including sauce and appetizers.  But worth it!!!",The Dolar Shop
97,"Closed until winter! They are renovating to move next door!Address:45-04 162nd Street, Flushing NY 11358",Food taste ok because of tons.of MSG.Waitress r so rude because they probably make more money than customers in tips only. They charge money for plane bowl of rice which no other korean restaurant charges  extra . Parking is terrible.,"Waitresses are friendly and foods are decent. The cashier( most of time owner) is dirty. I saw him going into the one unisex bathroom and when i went into bathroom after him, the toilet seat was down andthe faucet was dry. It happened twice in past two weeks as i go there often for lunch. Im not going back","I came here on the coldest day ever and it did not disappoint! Nice warm soojaebi and kalguksu with soondooboo.We ordered seafood oko pajun, bibim mandoo, spicy seafood soojaebi, and bulgogi soondooboo kalguksu for two people. Of course, we left with leftovers of seafood pajun since we were not going to share the noodle soups!Let me start by saying, their portions are HUGE! The seafood oko pajun is thicker than my likings but it goes well with pancake sauce (soysauce bottle with ""P""). Also, Be careful when you grab those mandoo! They come out hot since they are cooked to crispy perfection when you order them. In the center, they have salad with gochujang dressing (probably same sauce as their bibim guk su). But honestly, I love to eat the seafood pajun with salad from bibim mandoo. As for kalguksu (hand cut noodle) and soojaebi (hand thrown dough), they know how to do it! I grew up eating this dish time to time. I have never seen it with soondooboo except here, so it is an experience every single time I visit! I recommend this place if you are cold and craving something warm and spicy. Also, treat yourself to bibim mandoo and pancake!","* had about 12 tables, seats about 25-30 ppl. So not super big, but bigger than hole on the wall. * service was fast efficient and friendly* must order the seafood pancake. It's a bit pricey at ~22 (relative to other Korean spots) but totally worth it!!!! Lots of seafood. Very fluffy and crispy. Pretty big too. LIKE BEST IVE EVER HAD GOOD!!!* noodles were ginormous portion. Tbh two ppl could share one I think. ~$16 a bowl. Lots of noodles, flavorful broth. Tofu super soft. I got the beef bowl n there were lots* so they have a/c blasting. But by the end we all felt hot, bc of eating all the noodles.",I came here with my three daughters and my brother for dinner. This is a small little restaurant with limited seating for the customers. Staff: The staff here seem very friendly and nice. The service is pretty fast for a restaurant. Bacon Oko Pajun: This is like a Korean type of a pancake with a unique taste to it. I usually do not eat bacon but this had no bacon taste to it to me. This was by far the best dish out of everything that we had ordered.Kalguksu: This was basically a plain broth with the noodles itself. It was kind of a bland kind of a taste. This dish might need a little more work to give it the kick that it needs.Bulgogi Soondubu Sujebi: This dish was not what I had expected it to be. The tofu was soft and tasted delicious with the mild spicy soup base. The bulgogi was too dry for my taste buds. The sujebi noodles was not what I had expected especially when I thought it was a freaking potato! The sujebi noodle was very disappointing to me and made me not want to finish my food.Overall: I think the food here can use a little more work. If anyone decides to come here then you have to try the Bacon Oko Pajun because that was delicious.,Dae Sung Kal Guk Su
98,"I was hoping to like this shop because it was so cute! Looks like a nice place to sit, eat, and study/work. I ordered the fit wrap, took out mushrooms and added chicken. They made my wrap and forgot the chicken and avocado. I went back to have them remake it...the person remade it so sloppy and with an  attitude. I stated: he mad the wrap so poorly it can't be closed. He then complained saying I added too much stuff to the wrap. All I did was ask for chicken instead of mushroom! I just left with my sloppy wrap and will not be going back. Cute spot but poor customer service!!!By the way Chipotle stuffs the hell out of their wraps and it still looks neat!","They just schlepped together a subpar tasteless latte that looks nothing like advertised, at this price point I expect something that does not look like something I can produce using hot milk and a blender. The fo was bubbly and did not last. I've had better lattes at a gas station for half the price.","Well...I went into this small cafe because it has the word ""roast"" in it...thinking it was a roaster cafe...boy was I wrong. Tried the latte...and it wasn't that good. I actually drank half of it. But I think from the traffic in this cafe, people are there more for the food. I'm just basing this rating off the coffee.","They never Fail me!!! Love these people, their kale salad and orzo soup is always delicious. My one year old loves their orzo soup, we trust the ingredients and their flavors are great. Their sweets are also great! Delivery is super fast","Enjoyed a late lunch at Roast N Co on Monday afternoon. Solid food, good coffee, and a relaxed environment conducive to work.Quality: Roast N Co is a great little cafe right near my home. I had passed it numerous times and finally stopped in for lunch. I went with the Rotisserie Chicken Sandwich, which had chicken, potatoes, and gravy on a baguette. The potatoes may have been a bit overkill, but the gravy was great as was the fresh bread. It came with a side of fries that were also delicious. To go along with it I also got a Cafe Latte, which hit the spot.Quantity: A good sized sandwich and a massive cup of coffee.Value: $9.00 for a Rotisserie Chicken Sandwich. $4.00 for a Medium Cafe Latte.Ambiance: Roast N Co is located in Forest Hills, Queens. A quaint cafe along Queens Blvd. they have a nice space to enjoy a cup of coffee or pull out a laptop and do some work. They have a few tables up front near a large glass window and some additional seating lining the right wall to the back. The decor is simple, but they did have a cool antique cabinet near the front. Soft rock music played quietly in the background, which is helpful if you plan to do some work.Crowd: A small crowd of folks doing work and a few others grabbing take-out.Service: Friendly and fast. Also, appreciated they checked on guests who were there for a while doing work.Parking: Some street parking in the area.","Small and cozy cafe / coffee shop. There are only a few tables on the side, so it is more of a quick bite kind of place. Their menu mainly consists of  sandwiches, salads, and bakery items. They also have a very good rotisserie chicken deal - a whole chicken with 4 sides for $22.95. The chicken is on the smaller side, but combined with the sides, it was definitely a big enough meal for two people.The chicken was pretty moist. Not the best tasting chicken I've had, but still above average with an interesting herbal flavor to it. All the sides were great too. I tried the kale, quinoa, sweet potatoes and rice pilaf. It seems that they take good care in seasoning their food well, but also making sure it is prepared in a healthy manner.",Roast & Co
99,Got food to go and it was good again!This time I tried the noodles with siracha and the flavor/heat is on point. It isn't over sweet like other Thai restaurants. My favorite place.,"Yum yum yum! Everything here is one of a kind. Superb authentic Northern Thai cuisine. A must-try. The restaurant is tiny and we went there around 5pm on a Friday, and by 6:30/7pm there is already a line and it was packed. We ordered so much food and every dish was just absolutely unique. They even have pig's brain on the menu (they called it 'pork brain' on the menu) but we didn't feel adventurous enough to order it. Someday....","Horrible. I don't understand the other reviews. I love Thai food and this was the worst I've ever had. The beef in the khao soi was inedible (could not be cut or chewed), the pad kee mao was greasy and sour, and the kang hoh had two tiny pieces of pork in it. Expensive and it all went into the trash. I feel sick from the few bites I had.","This is why I travel over 1,200 miles from home, because of the availability of restaurants like Lamoon. I'm here for five days on a self-guided combination work/food tour. To be clear, food is not the subject of my self-employment. That's computer work. My hobby is eating spectacular food, and less than an hour after having lunch here, if someone could foresee the future and tell me this was the best meal of the trip I'd be totally OK with that. And it could be.Nam Prik Noom was the centerpiece of my lunch, savory fried rice in a chili paste with chicken added. Just the right amount of heat, intensely flavorable, perfectly moist. As part of the lunch special I had one appetizer available and chose the fried rice balls which were crisp, crunch and savory, small bits of Thai basil (I believe) protruding and contained within. A wonderful texture to pair with the entree. Two rice dishes at once for lunch? Hell, yea! And a Thai ice tea to boot, sweet, but not cloyingly so. Perfection.Better yet, and especially to my liking, the portion sizes are just right. I get that it's in vogue to serve way too much food for lunch, but please, not everyone wants that. This was just right, not only in portion size, but in every other way possible.Cash only. Seats maybe 20 if packed. Menu is packed with photos of the actual menu, helpful for folks like yours truly. Very highly recommended.","Updating due to the response: I appreciate the effort made. I hope this is how situations are handled during the conflict.  Ordered some delivery from here.

I've been coming here for years for their amazing mofongo and fried meats. Their food is consistent and artery clogging deliciousness. Service isn't the greatest, but that's fine.

Upon checking in, I noticed the offer for a free soda. Got the check and was charged for the soda. Showed one of the waiters the offer and he just said no a few times and walked away. I figured maybe he didn't understand and tried to explain it to the cashier when paying. He was also dismissive and rude and just shook his head. I told him it was an offer they had to have agreed with Yelp on to offer to their customers and that they should honor it. He wouldn't even look me in the eyes and just shook his head at me and kept saying no. The soda was a dollar. It was more so the principle of it than the actual money. If they weren't aware of the offer, at least treat your customers with respect and apologize for the confusion instead of being rude and dismissive. I'm disappointed in the way that they handled this situation and will not be returning.  Also, if this offer isn't valid, Yelp should try to contact the business and correct this because it doesn't look good for either parties.",I've been coming here since childhood.

101,"The food was great and I understand there was only one server that afternoon so she was busy. However, when we tried to pay the check, they didnt bring back the change. We sat for a bit more until the server asked if we wanted change. After telling her we did, we waited even longer and nobody brought it back. We just left. As a server, you always bring the change back unless they tell you to keep it. I get that some people dont tip well, but that doesnt mean you should play the waiting game and hope they dont care enough about the money to wait that long.

Called to make reservation and was told 5 people + min of $30/person and min 20% tip. Not sure if that's new but that's little outrageous,"What an amazing ambiance.A fusion Korean restaurant with dishes that everyone loves. Not just Korean dishes, but what many often crave with soju and beer. Frankly, I did not have high expectation for the dishes as The Coop is known as a ""place to drink,"" but props to the chefs working late nights in the kitchen! All the dishes have their own personalities and they taste amazing.Recommended: Bulgogi QuesadillaTtuk BokkiTruffle FriesI love the ambiance of dimmed lights where everyone look so beautiful. I also saw that the high tables are made with convenient storage (beneath the table) where you can really relax without worrying that someone is stealing stuff from your purse. Usually it's irritating (and difficult) to keep an eye on your purse sitting on the side of your table/chair while you're getting drunk. And hands down to the servers for maintaining such service with bottomless cups for the evening (with our consent of course). The service is amazing, they all seemingly have many years of experience at hand. I highly recommended to everyone and anyone to spend their Friday/Saturday nights at The Coop.","I dined at coop with a friend because their menu has raw oyster and salad. Pork in tomato sauce, snowy salmon tartare and duck salad was ordered. Including a matcha mojito and ice coffee.The pork in tomato sauce was very salty and sweet, but the pork was well cooked. The snow salmon was well present but the amount is tiny. Most of it was croutons, dressing and 25% was the actual salmon. The roasted duck wedge salad was quite tasty but again too salty. Mostly romaine salad. About 85% and the roasted duck was chopped into tiny pieces and fried. The texture was like ""rousong"" which is dried shredded pork. The matcha mojito was served in a martini glass. No straw or anything to accompany it with. The only thing I tasted was the vodka and matcha. They probably only put a single teaspoon of almond milk. I did not taste any honey at all. Perhaps they forgot. There was a tiny bit of cinnamon powder and a johnny jump up flower which is edible. The cinnamon powder was a poor choice. It is an expensive if not overpriced drink at $14. I only drink about 10%. Overall, the food was average and too salty. The presentations are good effort. The staffs are polite. The oysters is probably the only plate I enjoyed because it was not processed nor tampered with too much.","The food was okay, nothing special about the fried chicken. We ordered budae jjigae, really feel like something I can cook at home easily, wasn't too impressed. However, the decoration is cool and staff are friendly. I wish they would pay more attention when delivering our Diet Coke, we have to ask again for this. In general, everything is okay, if I'm craving for korean food, I'm going to bay side.",The Coop
102,"So here is the thing. The food is delicious and creative and the service is perfectly fine. Why only 3 stars? Two problems.1. this is a problem amongst many NYC restaurants and it drives me mad. When it is 90+ degrees outside OPENING THE WINDOWS AND DOORS WON'T COOL THE RESTAURANT DOWN! turn on your damn AC so customers aren't sweating like pigs over their meals. 2. THE FLIES! They are EVERYWHERE! Jeez I wonder how they got in? Maybe...just maybe...its because you're serving food with the damn windows and doors open. No it's not cute and breezy to have the ""fresh air"" come in if the fresh air is stank NYC 95 degree air. Keep the heat and flies out by closing your windows and doors. You are NOT a swanky French cafe, you're a cafe on Austin street with zero outdoor ambiance.",We walked in with the sign still showing the business's closed.. we tried to sit but no one even acknowledged us and then we looked around to see spider web everywhere :(,"Left this place really upset. I walked 20 minutes just to find a nice local cafe to do my work in. And I always bring my reusable cup to cafes around NYC boroughs and never had an issue. But when I came here, the manager told me he can't have me sitting there drinking their coffee (which I spent $6 on) out of their competitor's cup. I understand local businesses need to up hold a certain marketing/branding image but it was the way he looked at, spoke and approached me that made me really upset.I will never return here again. It's pricey, dark, and the previous time that I came, it was really humid and difficult to breathe when it became packed.","I had the Reuben sandwich and it was surprisingly really good! I'm so glad to have a vegan spot nearby and i can't wait to try all the options they have on the menu. Chai tea latte tasted great as well. I will suggest they fix up their bathroom. The toilet was falling apart, the seat was completely removed.","My favorite cafe in NYC air so many reasons!  First, the food. Everything on the menu is healthy and delicious. Vegan and organic sandwiches, salads, soups and a wonderful breakfast menu as well.  The coffee is gourmet and fantastic. Way better than Starbucks and with higher quality. Tip: Try the oatmilk in your latte. Rich and creamy and doesn't interfere with the taste of the coffee unlike soy and almond milk can do. Next, they have a wonderful staff. Offer (the manager) always greets his customers with a smile and pleasant conversation. He authentically cares about people and also serving them quality food and beverages. Hiro is a wonderful barista (he recommended the oat milk and told me it was a lifechanger - which it was!).  This is not the kind of place where you will be treated with indifference or attitude. At The Red Pipe you really are treated like family. Finally I have to mention the awesome vibe here. Relaxing music, interesting art on the walls and a community feel makes the Red Pipe a favorite for Forest Hills residents and visitors as well. I was just telling the manager that The Red Pipe reminds me of how local businesses used to be when I was growing up before things got so commercialized.  It has heart and personality which makes it a true hidden gem.","I love it. My first meal here- grilled vegan cheese with veggies, and chocolate fudge brownie, vegan yes. Except  for some flying insects at the back, the spot is fresh, clean, and comfortable. The attendants were the cutest lgbt squad. I might come here regularly for light after yoga breakfast.",Red Pipe Cafe
103,"I have been to many different Gyu-Kaku locations, and not just the ones in the city. I have even been to Gyu-Kaku overseas, in Taiwan, so I am definitely not new on the concept and have a pretty well rounded idea on how they operate. I made reservations for 7:15pm on a weekday and when I arrived there was no hostess. I waited for 5 minutes and decided to walk upstairs. The bartender saw my friend & I walk up and we obviously looked lost and he just proceeded to stand there. After 5 minutes, an employee approached us and I said I have reservations and gave her my name. She said she will be back and walked downstairs. When she came back up, she told me friend they don't allow outside drinks (she had a Starbucks drink) and I told her don't worry we will order cocktails but she still said my friend had to toss it. I understand not allowing outside food/drinks but if someone was going to order drinks, I would allow it (but whatever I don't own the place). So we sat down and the server greets us, I didn't understand what she said but she said it in a polite manner. We decided to order the AYCE Ultimate package which seemed like a good deal. It's actually a good deal for the restaurant bc I don't eat meat so I ordered the cheapest items. The apps came in a timely manner and then the meats came. Now this place is a bit sneaky, they don't serve you all the meat selections. Halfway thru our grilling, my friend said the shrimp and salmon wasn't served. No one came to check on us so we couldn't ask. The AYCE option says you have 90 minutes to order your food and after that you are cut off from ordering. At the almost 90 minute point, the server finally re-emerges and said our 90 minute ordering time is almost up and if we want anything else. I said we never got the seafood and she said b/c we ordered a lot, she didn't bring it out bc she thought we wouldn't want it (in other words they are cheap, they withhold your food hoping you won't remember) and then she asked if we wanted anything else. I said I'll take the s'mores dessert. Not even 5 minutes later, a woman who identified herself as the manager came and said she has another reservation waiting downstairs for a table and it's a big group so they need my table and the table next to us. She said because we been there since 7:15pm and it was almost 8:40 pm (even though there was 2 other tables that were there before we even got there that could both seat 10). Now Korean or Japanese BBQ isn't a meal you eat on the run, people need time. Especially if you are doing the cooking yourself. She even admitted the server failed to tell us she needed the table back at 8:50pm. I said fine give me the check bc quite frankly, the drinks sucked and the food was mediocre. The manager then had the nerve to scold me and said she will charge me next time for unfinished food. She asked me to leave before I was done, before I got the rest of my order, before I got my dessert and then threatened to charge me for un-finished food. Does that make sense? I don't even like to waste food so I would never intentionally over order but I wasn't going to eat every last crumb even if we weren't asked to leave our table early. I told her that's ridiculous and if she expected me to lick the plate. I'm not sure if there was a language barrier bc her English was poor but I found that whole lecture was absurd especially since you are asking me to leave before I finished eating because you didn't seat reservations accordingly. This location never changes the grill either, the entire time we were there it was only changed once bc I asked a male server if he could bc everything was burning. And even though the Mango Mai Thai & Geisha sucked, I was thirsty but no one ever came and asked if I wanted another drink. The bathroom downstairs also reeks of urine and is disgusting, even for Flushing standards. For $160, I expect the restaurant to let me finish my meal and for the manager to be competent. This location is going to give the rest a bad rep!","Trying ordering by the plate instead of the pre-sets, excited to eat a variety of meats","This is my second time to have dinner here. However the service they provided tonight was so much worse than my last time. Waiters kept wasting my time during the whole dinner. Every time I wanted to order more meats or added some water or changed a plate or something, I hardly could find my waiter. Did they just wanted to reduce the times of services so that I could leave as soon as possible? Is it because I came in at 9:25 pm and they knew that I am having a time-limited buffet, so waiter felt upset or something? They really did not care about how the customers feel. They even would not ask you if you want to change your plate or add some water or something unless you ask them by yourself. Moreover, I kept asking them to give me a white rice at least three times, but they still didn't give me. Even when I asked them to give me the check, they still waste my half hour to get it. Why did they need half hour to get a check? How hard it was? And in the end, some of the meats were really not fresh but they still forced me to eat the steak otherwise they would require me to pay this.What a ridiculous restaurant, 100% I will not come again.","I came here for dinner and good thing I made a reservation cause they were definitely packed! As you walk in, you get greeted by multiple staff members and the service was great. It's definitely a bustling spot that's loud but great for social dinners. My party and I got the Shogun deal and added beef tongue. It was super filling for the 5 of us, with all the appetizers and the delicious meats. They also change the grill often so that you don't get burnt meat. You get to grill your own meats to your preference but the staff also gives you a recommended time to grill each item. We got a few drinks like the mango mai tai and the berry smoothie with alcohol added in. I really liked the berry smoothie! The meal ended with s'mores which we had with vanilla ice cream, which was a great combo. Overall, great service and delicious food!","Stopped in on a Thursday night at around 8:30 PM and had to wait an hour for a table for two. We didn't mind the wait though because we were able to grab a few happy hour drinks in the meantime. If you're wondering why there was still happy hour at 8:30 PM on a Thursday, it's okay because I was wondering the same thing. (Probably a business tactic if you ask me) but it was a business tactic that worked because we split a bottle of sake and a beer all for about $20. For dinner, we split a meat lovers combo which ended up being the perfect amount of food for two people. 10/10 would recommend the garlic fried rice. Our waiter was super attentive and overall I would definitely recommend this spot for some delicious Japanese BBQ","Gyu-Kaku has to be one of my favorite restaurants to go and also introduce others to. My fiancé and I have been here on countless occasions and have never had a bad experience. The food is always great. Perfectly spiced and seasoned. The meats are always fresh and we always leave full. The staff here is knowledgeable and super friendly. Even as they get busy, someone will be by toMake sure that you're not left waiting too long. They are well versed I. Their menu and can read your cues very well, like when you're holding out ordering to start happy hour. Gyu-Kaku has a happy hour unlike most places. The drinks are poured with a heavy hand, and are mixed beautifully. Never had a drink that's too sweet or sugary here. Reservations are definitely needed during peak times, as your wait time can easily hit over an hour. And with many tables cooking their own food, it's hard to truly gauge how long you'll be waiting.",Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ
104,We went here for Brunch after seeing the pics on Instagram. We ordered the Cannoli pancakes and they were out of this world. My only suggestion would be to share the brunch pancakes.  The amount they give you is enough for 3 or even 4 people.,Horrible the past 2 times we have ordered the order is completely wrong !! Nasty when you call to tell them what is wrong with the order !!they don't have any issue calling you to tell you the up charge ! Besides being overpriced the rudeness of Raymond who answered the phone !! They said I will send you a new one for what wait a other hour for it arrive !! Never again !!!! If I can give - stars I would !!,Went here to eat ....food was ok . Tried it again  figured give it a second try BAD IDEA!!!! Was completely full of oil and salt. Threw out everything,"Great Dinner Food With Its Own Twist. Huge Portions With Big Plates.Affordable Food.Pleasant Waiting Staff. Anytime (Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, Dinner) Is A Good Meal.Will Be Going For A While.","I would have loved to give good eats 4 stars, however there's nothing worse than eating delicious food and receiving mediocre service. The food here never disappoints whether you are having the overly dramatic but well worth it pancakes, to the big selection of burgers with different toppings, to the healthy wraps! I really enjoy coming here, especially on winter mornings to enjoy a nice cup of hot chocolate. However I do feel they can improve on customer service.. they always seem to be rushing and not really paying attention, moving on to the next task before I'm even done talking. Getting their attention was almost like playing double Dutch and getting smacked with the rope. The food is good though.","We are giving a three star because the food are inconsistent.This is a great place for brunch in the area. The corn beef hash is very yummy, my husband loves it because it is so much better than the one he grew up eating at a different diner. We also like the omelets but it's always hit or miss. The omelets are always good size, but sometimes with less and sometimes more ingredients. Also, the omelets are sometimes perfectly cooked and sometimes over cooked. The portion size for omelets is always too big that we have to pack it. I wish they can lower the price and make it smaller so we don't have to waste food, omelets are not good when you pack home. They used to offer free fruit the first couple times we went but they don't do that anymore.We are hesitant to return because of the inconsistency and the big portions. Sometimes just thinking about the big portion makes me full .",Good Eats Diner
105,"I'm not going to lie, I was extremely excited to try this place out. I struggled with parking, walked in the heat, upon arrival I was greeted. I was told I could sit wherever.Going to my seat, by the window, o noticed a dead cockroach on the table. I just stood up and walked out. I'm sure there were no cockroaches on the food, but the fact that there was on on the table made me cringe. For that reason and that reason alone, I probably won't be coming back. ----reply to Jodi,If you did a deep clean there wouldn't be a dead cockroach on the table my dude. Sorry I didn't want to eat a restaurant with dead bugs. Doesn't sit well in my stomach. That's gross.

Wentold them ahead of time we were doing seperate checks we had 8 people. We wanted 3-4 seperate checks. Some cash some credit.. ita always aweful paying a check here.  Seems they dont really want the business.. people that work there are rude! Was in tonight with 3 girlfriends. Had a nice dinner. We went to pay the bill and split it 4 ways. The ""manager"" told us no they dont do that. They will do 3 but not 4. Wtf.  My friend said we have been here and you have done 6.  He was so rude basically yelling at us. So we said whats the difference with 4 seperate checks or splittling the bill 4 ways  he said the credit card co charge them after 3. What that doesnt make sense.:.  And the guy that served us was an absolute dick! Yellin at is telling is its not mcdonalds , this is the rule.  I have worked in the restaurant business and you can split a bill 16 ways! It was complete shit! Both men need a class in customer service. And the douchey waiter who continued to yell at us. Was upset he didnt get a tip. And the manager even said what no tip??  No not when you are that rude!! The owner needs to look into these two.  Rude rude","Overall loved the service and food. Would definitely  get the veg taco again, they were delicious! Spivey margarita were good also. The guacamole was a little on the bland side, missing some spices and tomatoes and more cilantro.Would I go back? Yes, to try other things on the menu. =)","Delicious Mexican restaurant Astoria with great tacos! They have good service and legit food. Can't go wrong with the chips and guacamole appetizer. I really enjoyed these two tacos:1. Cameron Adobado (shrimp) 2. Gringa (al pastor with melted cheese)On their tacos you can add crispy grilled cheese for $1 extra per taco. I would at least try one taco with this add on. The Gringa taco tasted great with this.The only downside is the price. The tacos can range from $4.50 to $6.50. The taste is great, but the portions are small. For the price you pay for each taco, you get a small amount of food. I had to get 4 tacos in order to feel semi-full.","Volcanoes! I don't even know if that's a real thing in Mexico but I'm sold. I had something similar in Oaxaca where they use cheese instead of a taco shell.It's basically a taco with a second taco skin being completely made of griddled cheese! Top it with steak, mushrooms, avocados, and salsa. Whewwww man, that was a good taco. One order or the volcanoes will fill you up too. The chips and guacamole and salsa were delicious. You really gotta love a place that fries chips fresh to each order. Also sampled the fish tacos, fresh and tasty but after having the volcano, everything else can't compare. Volcanoes and chips/guacamole, you won't be disappointed.",Chela & Garnacha
106,"I had been so excited to go here and it turned out to be a disappointing waste of $$$. When you enter the restaurant, the aroma of seafood hits your nose right away. The seating area is moderately sized and decorated with wooden tables, like most pubs in K-town. We made a reservation, but on a Friday it was rather empty. We ordered the live octopus ($30) and it was what you expected it to be; slimy but an experience you want to try out. They give 2 sauces to dip it in. The aftertaste was unpleasant - it tasted like dead salty fish. I had a few pieces and was over it. We also got the famous seafood hot pot. It smelled delicious, I was drooling! There was a generous portion of shrimp, mussels, a few lobster legs. However, at $100+ this was a let down as the broth was extremely bland. It lacked seasoning, so the fish itself tasted uncooked and bland as a result. For a dinner that cost $150+, the food was not good at all and lacked flavor. However, our waiter was very friendly and attentive so I feel obliged to give them 2 stars for staff services. 3/10, would not recommend.","Before living from flushing area I been to sik gaek which it was a really good experience. But the wood side wasnt a great experience I had which I wont be returning. Although the waiter was nice and very attentive but the point is THE FOOD!!Maybe it was my mistake ordering that because sik gaek is mostly known as their seafood hot pot. I ordered two portion of gopchang and it was one of my biggest mistake!First the gopchang was frozen! It wasn't fresh as I had at ""gopchang story"" Second it had smell to it which I pour in soju to make less smell. Third it just tasted weird that I stopped eating after 4 bites. The sides dishes came with kimchee, a fried egg and spicy rice cake.Overall won't be returning and just an advice for everyone DO NOT ORDER GOPCHANG!","Last time we ate at Sik Gaek was on northern Blvd, this branch is in Woodside. Place looks identical with its decor but much more cramped. Menu is the same. We order the seafood pot for $99, bulgogi beef and seafood pajun. We are apart of 5 sitting in a corner booth that was both cramped and too warm sitting right in front of the bathroom and entry way to kitchen. Food was very salty and seafood wasn't fresh. The pot had a lot of fillers such as bean sprouts, cabbage and rice cakes. Some clams didn't open even when left on the pot cooking for over 30 mins. There were a lot of small mussels, 3 shrimps, half of a crab and a 1 lb lobster. We all nibbled at it. Clearly wasn't nearly anything like the northern Blvd branch. After the meal, I was sick for 3 days because I am highly allergic to MSG. Won't be returning to this place...ever!","I'm always happy to be back in this beautiful place. This has been one of my favorite spot in queens. What I like most about this place is : service, food, and environment.          Food is great as usual. I like their spicy marinated pork, beef galbi, khimchi soup, and scallion pancake. These are the food that I crave for when I don't eat korean food for a while. And, I think about this place every time when I crave. I'm here sometime with my friends and sometime with my family members .  They've always loved their food and their service. Everyone's here is really frank, active,  and are willing to help anytime.       This time, I ordered pork, beef, and khimchi soup. They were all really delicious.        To conclude, service and food is outstanding as usual .","We placed a reservation 24 hours priors to arriving. We were seated in a small table. I pointed to the larger table by the wall. The waiter said no its reserved. I tried to tell the waiter we have a reservation so instead of seating us to one of the 3empty large tables, he told us to wait for this table of their choice that still had food on it. They cleaned it quickly and have us seated. They were out of abalone which was why we came for. So we ordered the seafood combo with plenty of clams, 2 scallops and a huge clam. 20 oysters and live octopus. The clams were very gritty. The octopus was great. Fun to eat and fresh.The large clam and scallop had cheese on top but became extremely rubbery and hard after being grilled. Bad topping they put. The shrimp were tasteless and was not properlyGutted. Overall the service was good but need to be more attentive. The food could be better.I cannot get over the FACT that this is a Korean place and cannot make good kimchi. It was super sweet and tasteless.","My family and I came on a late Saturday night and the place was still packed! We were greeted and seated immediately. The restaurant is located on a main road and there is a small parking lot right in front that they share with a few other businesses in that strip. Because we came late, we were able to find parking quickly. For a table a 6, we ordered a few main courses to share. We started with the live squid and the seafood pancake. For the main dishes, we ordered the kalbi, the empire spicy seafood pot, and the budae jigae. Although a little scared, the live squid was delicious and super fun to eat. I was terrified of it getting stuck in my throat, but it was delicious and the perfect texture. The kalbi was flavorful - my dad devoured the dish within minutes! I wasn't a big fan of the budae jigae, I've definitely had better. Besides the spiciness, you couldn't really taste any other flavors, which was disappointing. And here comes the highlight of the dinner - the empire spicy seafood pot! This is the most famous dish of the restaurant, just a big pot of seafood and veggies and udon noodles with amazing flavor. My mom is allergic to all soy products, so we asked to make sure to exclude tofu and bean sprouts. As we started digging into the big pot, we discovered a big handful of bean sprouts, and by now, my mom has already started reacting to it. We spoke to the server and they were very apologetic. They brought out a whole new pot, despite the fact that we have already eaten a few clams and shrimps. The chef even came out to apologize. My poor mother was suffering but they were apologizing profusely that she actually felt bad. If it wasn't for the bean sprouts, the pot was my mom's favorite dish, that says a lot!Overall, it was a great experience, hope they're more careful next time! Food allergies are scary and unpredictable.",Sik Gaek
107,"Food is great. Service--HORRENDOUS! If you have time to wait 45 minutes after flagging EVERY server for water, by all means. I called for a pick-up order. They said it will be ready in 45 minutes. I arrived 15 minutes after. They had me wait for ANOTHER FULL HOUR for pick-up. I tried to be polite, truly, I smiled as I asked for how much longer, but every single person I asked all said, ""let me check."" When they come out the kitchen, WALKED RIGHT PASS ME! As if I'm invisible--very frustrating. To add insult to injury, I get home, unwrapped the bag, no garlic fried rice which was paid for.UNACCEPTABLE.",This is one of my favorite Pilipino restaurant in town. Not once I didn't have a good meal here.,Of all the Filipino restaurants in NY nothing comes close. All the food are just ridiculously delicious. And they staff are very friendly....,"If you're looking for authentic Filipino food this is it. Look no further. I stumbled in about 5:30 before the dinner rush. We were promptly seated by a wonderful server. At first glance I noticed this place was much more upscale than I had imagined. Our tables were laced with white cloth napkins and beautiful glasses for your water. After going through the menu we ordered half fried chicken, crispy knuckles, pork belly appetizer  pork chops and one mango drink and another drink similar to lemon. Idk how to say this without sounding a bit cliche but the drinks were amazing , the mango drink tasted like pure mango pulp,  so sweet. The citrus  drink was fantastic as well, I can't describe the flavor but there was a depth and complexity to it that I liked.The pork belly appetizer was served with a raw egg but it cooked quickly on the sizzling cast iron plate it was brought out on. This dish was very good. Next we tried the fried chicken overall it was tasty very simple but tasty. The pork chop had great charred flavor and paired nicely with the rice. Again nothing spectacular it just right. The crispy knuckle I didn't even get to try because I was so full from the other dishes. Although the food wasn't amazing, like the best thing I ever ate in the entire world, the meal felt familiar. It felt like it was a home cooked meal and that feeling is priceless.","Great food, great customer service!!!They probably have the best tuna belly in NYC and sago gulaman. Their prices are very very reasonable too.","I've had a little hole in my heart since Krystal's Cafe 81 in East Village closed down a few years ago. They served great silog dishes, a type of Filipino breakfast, for such an affordable price. So happy that Tito Rad's was able to deliver on the quality, and it's become my go-to silog spot now. Both the tapsilog (cured beef) and tocilog (cured pork) were excellent, as was the longsilog (with longganisa, Filipino cured sausage). The garlic rice was tasty and intensely garlicky, just the way I like it, and I loved those slivers of pickled veggies as well.Aside from the silog dishes, I had the adobong baboy (pork adobo) and sinigang with belly bangus (sour tamarind soup with veggies and milkfish belly). The adobong baboy was not as strong and vinegary like some of the ones I've had, but it was very comforting and flavorful. I also enjoyed the little I had of the spicy and sour sinigang, but I had a sore throat at the time so I couldn't really enjoy it. I brought the rest back for my mom and she seemed to like it.One thing, though: They either don't serve ube ice cream with their halo halo, or they didn't offer it to us, because our halo halo came with vanilla ice cream. What. Is. This. Bullshit.",Tito Rad's Grill
108,"This is the first time I've been here. I had my eye on it for a while especially with my organic diet. The atmosphere is a chill modern outdoor vibe. The food was ok.. nothing special. I had mussels for and appetizer and the shrimp as and the main course. There was sooo many things I wasn't to try on the menu but I figured I'd come back a few times. Idk if it's not mentioned on the menu or I had a moment but I was very disappointed when I noticed it was zucchini noddles and not actually pasta. I asked the server who wasn't the best at all and he said ""we don't have anything pasta here"" not a sorry or anything. So i roped in the service with the food and there you have the 3 stars. Maybe I'll revisit or order out and give them another chance but I was lowkey turned off especially since I invited friends out to this place.","Came here with friends a couple of months ago. One of my friends is vegan, the other vegetarian, and I'm a carnivore. This place had something for each of us and a menu for each of us as well. It's a very small restaurant but we arrived without a reservation on a quieter night and were seated right away. The truffle mac and cheese is to die for!",Great food but served by waiters who have an attitude! Prepare to be ignored and barked at.,"Good food , good vibes Mac & cheese was delicious! The ""chicken"" flat bread was OK not my favorite but I'd visit again",I ordered the vegan seitan wrap and I only ordered it because it came with roasted peppers so I thought it would be spicy but it's more creamy tasting than spicy. It was still good to me because I just added hot sauce to it. The Italian sausage was OK I wouldn't recommend them because they didn't have too much flavor too it. It took a while for the waiter to give us water but it was fine because of the setting being so nice.. my bf got the organic burger so 3 things ended up being 40$ not bad!  I will so come back:),"The menu looked great but you never know how the food will be until you have it. I was pleasantly surprised with just how delicious and well thought out every dish was. Let me start with the vegan truffle mac and cheese. There are A LOT of ways to mess up mac and cheese: the cheese can be too thick/thin, the breadcrumbs could be soggy or flavorless, the pasta can be overdone to the point of mush, and in this case they can put way too much truffle oil. No5 made the mac and cheese perfectly! This is so difficult to do but I seriously had no complaints. The pasta was cooked just the right amount, the truffle oil wasn't overpowering, the cheese was the best tasting vegan one I've had in a while, the breadcrumbs were crispy, and the mushrooms were fresh. I loved the fresh greens on top too! I also tried the sweet potato and quinoa cakes as an appetizer. While I wish they were crispier on the outside, the flavor was great and I loved the blackberry/blueberry topping with vegan parmesan. The fresh beets were a welcome addition as well. For dinner, I got their seiten wrap with fries. You think fries are as basic as you can get but wrong--these were on point! The seiten was wonderfully juicy and the fillings were fresh. The only thing I regretted was the wrap and sauce. The menu did not say anything about this being spicy but the wrap and mayo were chipotle based. You shouldn't  surprise someone with this. The vegan dessert was delicious as well and the service was great. Our waitress checked on us frequently even just from afar to make sure she timed all the dishes nicely. The owner was a bit flustered when I first came and said how I may have to wait a long time for food. First of all, you should not be persuading people to leave. And second of all, everything turned out fine. They were busy but they handled it like pros! So please, owner of No5, please know you're doing an awesome job and your food is delicious.",No5nyc
109,"Really wanted to love this food, We got Legend pops (5.95) and Blood Rice Cakes (5.95) - the chicken was good, really reminded me of Taiwanese street food, but the blood cake was so hard (in general) and hard to swallow and didn't have any real flavor. Really wish it was in more bite size small square pieces! Not sure if I would return.","The staff is very friendly and is willing to explain the menu and talk about what they have to offer. I've learned certain items are only available on the weekends and most items will take a while because everything is made fresh to order. As for the food, I expected a little more from their fried food concept. I ordered a few items to try and it was overrated. The flavors for everything tasted the same. The batter was a little bit much. I was looking forward to the popular Legend pops but they were dry and overcooked. The imperial tofu was bland. I was quite disappointed. I don't mind paying for good food but I definitely felt cheated paying so much for mediocre food. Overall, I was disappointed that this is based from Taiwanese and I expected a lot more for what it was.","I ordered the legend pops and with a yelp check-in, I got bouncing curds.The legend pops are basically Taiwanese style small pieces of fried chicken. At first bite, they were not bad, but nothing amazing. After awhile however, the chicken started to taste dry and even drier, especially since there was no moisture in the chicken and no sauce. The chicken was also fried with basil and the basil was salty.The bouncing curds which are basically cubes of fried tofu, had different spices added to the outer coating. I personally don't really like tofu, but sometimes if cooked well enough, I'd enjoy a bite or two. This didn't happen here.If you would like somewhere to sit, you can sit all the way in the back or even upstairs free of charge.3 stars because it was edible, but nothing amazing.","I was very excited to see that another Taiwanese Chicken shop had opened in Flushing. The first time I tried the Popcorn Chicken and Fried Tofu. Both came in large portions and were super filling. I didn't particularly enjoy the popcorn chicken as much because I thought it was more batter then chicken itself. It was still tasty though. The fried tofu was a bit tasteless, most probably because I didn't get any seasoning on it.So my second time around, I ordered the chicken pops (again), garlic string beans, and fried turnip cake all in Medium seasoning and black lemon pepper. With my Yelp check in, I also got to redeem the Venetian Tofu (they ran out of the bouncing curds). The wait time was about ten minutes. This time around the food was so delicious! I shared with my brother and we both could not finish. The medium spice really added a kick to it this time. Out of everything i ordered, my favorite was actually the fried turnip cakes.  Now I'm very eager to try the taro and blood rice cakes next. Also the chicken or leg cutlet since I want more meat. Overall, delicious food and nice owner. Add the seasoning if you want that extra kick!","TLDR: Taiwanese popcorn chicken specialist in the miniature food hall on 40th Road. Legend Pops, Garlic Broccoli. Spicy.I was in the area and this was a place I had wanted to try for awhile. While you do wait a bit for your food, that's because everything is made fresh to order. Good portion sizes too.We got the Legend Pops, asked for spicy - very tasty. There was a slight sweetness in the seasoning which I'm not sure of the exact ingredient. Regardless, it was enjoyable to eat. Crispy, they give you the skewers to pick up each piece. Lots of flavor in each bite. The chicken has the traditional tastes of garlic, ginger, five spice, etc.Wanted to have something else to accompany this but potatoes were a bit too filling as this was a midday snack. We opted for the garlic broccoli. It had the spice seasoning too but the florets got all crispy on the edges. Very good.If you're in the area and are in the mood for something crispy - give this place a try.","I am a fan! I like the freshness of their fried foods and every time I go into the store to walk to their stall, I just smell their popcorn chicken. I recommend eating their products within 30 minutes of buying because it just tastes so much better when things are hot and crunchy. I love their sweet potato fries. I love that they sprinkle plum powder on them which gives them this tart sweetness, which I love.The only thing is I feel like sometimes the spice might be a little overpowering, but go for mild and I think you'll be fine.Whenever I'm craving for some fried food, this is the place I want to go.",Legend Chicken
110,"We came here on a summer Friday, and the backyard was surprisingly empty. Maybe we were here too early?In any case, food was generally very good, although I think authenticity varied based on the order. We started with the Kathmandu poppers - basically a mirchi pakoda, but served with a chipotle mayo. A somewhat unmemorable dish for me, but maybe I'm just mad that it burned my mouth.Next we had the jhol momo, served in a well-spiced soupy sauce. The momos were tasty, although I can't imagine broccoli is part of the traditional filling in Nepal.We finished with the khana set, basically a thali, and my favorite part of the meal. In particular, the bread was incredible - we had a dense buckwheat roti that reminded me of the bajra roti you might find in some parts of Gujarati.",The plantain Momos are to die for. That's all I need to say. Order 2 of those at minimum.,"Momos yesss! I would come back here for the appetizers for sure! Entrees were yummy too, but the flavors weren't my personal preference. Most items were a little bit spicy, so be warn, but I spicy food so its up my alley.","Amazing Nepalese Food.  This newly open restaurant is sooooo good ( I almost dont want to write an review to spoil my favorite neighborhood spot) However, it is important their hardwork being seen and rewarded... by having more costumers.   Put my own selfishness aside. Awesome authentic music played in the restaurant( modern Nepalese music) and our waiter Parjuul  even gave us a little education on how the modern Folk Napalese music work . Everything is really good so far For starters-  Fried Fish. So flavorful - Not a Taco ( Nepalese style Taco. ) -  chicken Choila - a cold chicken dish it was awesome ( don't remember the name )- momo    They r sitting among Chilled tomato base sauce . Super Hot Momo. Be mindful takings a bite.Anyways my new favorite restaurant in Ridgewood. I hope I wont regret posting this review, so far I didnt have to wait in line ever .","This is a delightful Nepalese Indian restaurant over in Ridgewood. I read about them in the NYTimes Hungry City column, and feel that when Ligayan Mishan sings the praises of a restaurant, you must go. I went with the intention of hanging out in their recently renovated backyard space, but it was actually quite chilly that evening so we opted to eat inside.My group of 8 people enjoyed most of the food we had here. People were verbally groaning in pleasure over the crispy and spicy masala wings, the veggie, pork and chicken momos, and the ""not a taco."" This is a whole wheat roti with jerk chicken and a little bit of mayo. A must order for sure. I was definitely eye-ing the Kathmandi Alfredo, which the owner told us was a fusion dish they made up, but we had so much food we couldn't fit another on the table, let alone in our gullets. Their menu is really long, so there should be something to please every palate.","I've been here several times now and this is my new go to in the area, the food is Delicious, and I mean delicious I haven't had a single thing here i didn't enjoy. The staff are really friendly and knowledgable and the food comes out fast and fresh. Try the chicken choila, vegetarian momos, and get a ton of 'it's not a taco'",While In Kathmandu
111,This restaurant has always been the standard place to go to since it is open to either 1 or 2 am. But lately the quality of chicken has been decreasing so it was not as good as it use to be. It has a lot of seating and multiple televisions on at all times. They offer other Korean dishes along side their famous chicken wings. Overall a good spot if you have a group of friends to just chill and hangout.Food - 7/10Cleanliness - 8.5/10Staff - 8/10,My friend and I came here around 8pm on a Friday night. There was a 20 min wait but they take your number and text you when your table is ready.Parking in this area is hell .. literally the worst but go away from the main road into the suburban areas and you should be fine.We got the Medium Half & Half drumsticks and wing combo with tuffle fries.The wings were good and had just the right amount of flavor. The fries were honestly not the best truffle I've had but they were good and not overwhelmingly fatty.There menu has various choices of atypical food if you're not feeling just wings. 5% off when you pay with cash (I think It was 5%) but def worth the try. Not my fav wing spot but it sure is delish.,This Korean chicken place is amazing!!!! It's so crispy and soft it melts in your mouth! To die for!!,"My friend, a Flushing native, had been hyping up this Korean wing spot for months and I finally got to try it out when she hosted her birthday dinner here a couple of weeks ago.Our party of 9 arrived around 5:30pm on a Saturday without a reservation and was seated immediately at one of the long picnic tables at the very front of the restaurant. It was next to the window so it was brightly lit, and I really liked the overall modern/rustic vibes of the restaurant. It was a busy but not overly crowded evening.We all checked in on Yelp for our free shot of Lychee Soju each. A couple of us ordered additional cocktails ($10/each), a bottle of Peach Soju ($14) and then a 1000ml pitcher of Mango Soju ($30) to share. We had mentioned to our waiter that we were here celebrating a birthday, so he actually served our complimentary soju shots in another pitcher (or beaker) and filled it up to the 1000ml line - which was almost double the amount of shots. SHOUTOUT to all this free alcohol! We truly appreciated it. So we basically had TWO full beakers of soju, for the price of one. Amazing!For appetizers, we ordered the Calamari ($17) and Truffle Fries ($10) - both standard but great sharing foods. (I personally could've done without all the fried foods lol) Then came out the famous WINGS. (We ordered them as soon as we sat down because they take a while to make, pro tip.) We got 3 large orders ($22.95/each with about 20 pieces per order) with 2 of them being all Soy Garlic and the last one Half & Half -- half Soy Garlic and half Spicy Soy Garlic. Birthday girl advised us that the Spicy ones are actually RLY spicy, which was why we only ordered a half batch of them. She was right. I had only one, and that was enough for me for the night... don't get me wrong, it was good but I didn't want to continuously feel like I was dying as I kept eating. The regular soy garlic ones were BOMB and lived up to the hype. Not sure if I have an ultimate favorite/top Korean wings spot, but this one is up there with the others I've tried in the city (monomono, Pelicana, etc.)I wish they had offered some wet wipes to clean off our hands at the end but overall a wonderful experience! We all paid in cash for the discount, and we split the bill (w/ tax + tip) between 8 people. Everyone's individual total came out to be only $25/each. Sooooo worth it, and even cheap for all the food and drinks we ordered. It was LIT!","Came here with a friend after work on a Friday! We came around 5:00 so parking was easy, and the restaurant wasn't too packed!We were seated right away and given the menu. We were unaware that it was happy hour, but that was an added bonus! This is the type of spot where I suggest getting a few things off of the menu to share, rather than an individual entree each.We opted for the Kim-chi quesadilla, Parmesan fries with spic mayo, and the wing happy hour option (16 wings 1/2 spicy, 1/2 regular). They recommend you order the wings ahead because they take a while to cook.The fries and quesadilla came out first. Now you can't really go wrong with the fries. They were perfectly seasoned, and paired with a delicious spicy mayo sauce! The quesadilla was super interesting, nothing I've had before. It was a pulled beef quesadilla with Kim-chi on top. The Kim-chi gave it a tangy spicy taste which was delicious.Now my favorite part was the wings. They aren't your typical wings. They were coated special, and so savory and fresh. The meat wasn't too spicy, especially paired with blue cheese! they also provide a bucket to dump your bones which I appreciated! We will for sure be back again for the wings, and to explore the rest of the menu! Pricing is so reasonable, and service is friendly and fast!","Mad for Chicken has been around for a while and I decided to give a review for their outstanding consistency in food and customer service. We came here over the weekend during the Giants and Redskins game. We had a pretty arduous weekend and needed to pig out without any qualms. My fiance ordered the mac and cheese and I ordered truffle fries and the large ten piece boneless soy garlic chicken. We haven't been here in a while and the soy garlic was delicious, just like I remember. We also had some mango soju...a perfect complement to all the fat oils we were downing. I'm glad MFC has always stayed consistent and I will have to play my part and come here more often. It's a perfect place for food, drinks and to watch a game or two.",Mad For Chicken
112,"I have been trying to go here ever since it opened but fate kept me from going until today! Unfortunately, I was by myself so I couldn't order much but I had to try the cold appetizer spicy beef with tendon and Dan Dan noodles. The food had authentic Szechuan flavors with mouth numbing spices ( which is slightly different than spicy). So the beef with tendon was $9.95 which I thought was a little expensive. But you do get a lot of it. The Dan Dan noodles needed more sauce. It didn't quite cover all the noodles. I had to use the sauce from the beef to flavor my noodles. That said it was still quite tasty and satisfying.They were friendly and professional. The table next to me had a problem and they handled it politely and quickly. I want to come back with more people to try more of their dishes. The prices are a high but I'm sure rent is expensive on Austin Street.","Got take out here....chicken with broccoli, beef pancake and Dan Dan noodles.The first too dishes were okay.  The pancake was on the dry side and lacked any taste.My big issue was with the noodles.  They were dry and clumped together.  The sauces was brown and sweet...no spice at all.   Not sure what people are ordering and how they get high marks...for me this is a big pass.  Going back to Flushing where even the tiniest places serve better food.","I went here a few months ago and enjoyed the food as well as the service, so much so that when family came from out of town to visit, I brought them here thinking it would be a nice dinner.Big mistake, the server we had was so unpleasant. He barely spoke to or acknowledged us, slammed the menus and bill on the table, rushed us out, and was not accommodating at all when it came to certain requests we had for the dishes we ordered. Definitely one of the worst servers I've ever encountered. Even my family made several remarks regarding his awful behavior. Just overall looked like he was annoyed by us.A pro: the portions are big and food is mostly spicy, however it's not that tasty. The pungency overpowers the taste. Based on my last experience though, I won't be returning. I came for the spy-c food, not the spy-c attitude.",This is my favorite Chinese restaurant!  The cumin chicken is soo spicy and delicious! The black bean chicken with leaks is also great. All of the dumplings we tried were tasty as well. Especially enjoyed the pan fried pork dumplings.,"Spy C is one of the flagship Chinese establishments on Austin Street, and I couldn't be more grateful to have such a stellar establishment without making a trip out to Flushing for a comparable meal. It is wonderful to see Chinese food reaching mainstream popularity beyond typical lo mein/General Tso's/beef with broccoli take out. The food at Spy C is SO good and I have never been disappointed with any selections. My favorite dishes include the mortar and pestle smashed eggplant and peppers, crispy spicy shredded beef, yolk fried shrimp, and especially the braised fish with mustard greens. The quality of the ingredients, and the thoughtfulness with which the food is made are very apparent, and you will certainly be satisfied with whatever it is you ultimately choose. Service is excellent and the food is prepared relatively quickly. Spy C is a great example of great Szechuan cooking and it will surely be a hit with fans of Chinese food with a kick. One of the best spots in Forest Hills for sure!","A true Gem in Queens! Spy C rivals any of the best Chinese restaurants in Flushing or Manhattan or Chinatown. The Dan Dan noodles was almost perfect, just a tad bit mild. The chili fish, mouth watering chicken, pan cakes, are all done to perfection. The only thing missing is some good beers on draft to wash down the spicy food!",Spy C Cuisine
113,Food was horrible! Pics were a fake advertisement. The wait was 30 minutes just for an appetizer. Staff very limited. Shrimp Ceviche was really a Shrimp tostada and the fish taco and shrimp taco taste exactly alike full of dough and grease for the batter. The calamari was so chewy I couldn't digest. I wouldn't go back - bad experience,I did not have a great experience with industry 1332. We had ample amount of problems and the pancakes were terrible. We waited 10 minutes to get greeted and then they ran out of French toast which was the main reason why me and my best friend came. After being so terribly disappointed by that fact that French toast wasn't an option we gave the pancakes a try. Smh. Not good at all. Not the best place to go in Brooklyn if you want a good brunch. The mimosa was decent tho.,"I wanted to like this place so bad. I live three blocks away from it. The first time we went, the server didn't come up to us for 30 minutes so we left. I just went back again today and was disappointed yet again. I had a sangria which was overly sweet and tasted cheap. I also ordered a salad and when it came out it was wrong. When the right salad came out it was flavorless. I would've given it 1 star because this place is such a disappointment, but I gave + another start because the yucca fries were somewhat decent. Hope this place can get a new chef and get there stuff together. Much potential.","Absolutely would recommend this place 100%. Every time I go anywhere my biggest outlook is customer service , and let's say the gentlemen whom took care of us was exactly above and beyond. People don't understand that being nice goes along way.  The food was fenomenal and the drinks really really good!!!   Can't wait to come back and try few other things  Really nice staff !!!","Really cool spot. Came here for brunch and had the Huevos Rancheros. It was tasty with mild flavors and decent portion. The only thing I didn't like was the guac that came with the huevos rancheros. It had no flavor, no salt, no citrus nothing! My boyfriend had the 1332 breakfast and claimed it was delicious. He ordered it with turkey sausage, scrambled eggs, 2 piece toast and home fries and it came with a small mix green salad.  It looked good.For drinks I ordered the mimosa. OMG delicious I totally recommend it. You cannot go wrong with ""Buy 1 get 1 Free""! It was not sweet and I deff felt a kick after the first one. (Or maybe I'm just a light weight haha) I mean it was only 1pm. Very chill ambience, great customer service and with the music alone I knew I was in Brooklyn ... BIGGIE!!!!! Will definitely come back for some live music, drinks & dinner.","Memorial Day Fun! A couple of friends and I walked over after a day party at Nowadays. I had this spot bookmarked and glad we were able to try it out. We were greeted and placed in the back. I ordered the ginger uppercut in the mood for a ginger punch. Unfortunately, i didn't get it. The drink was a miss for me. Too pricey in my opinion and not enough kick. The food was great. The steak nachos were definitely top 3 in my opinion. The chicken  quesadilla was tasty. It was supposed to come with pico de gallo however it was left off our plates and we had to ask for it. I tasted the ribs and fish taco and they were good as well. The fried chicken was a miss. They were kind enough to remove it from my friends bill. Wouldn't recommend. I would go back for happy hour if i am in the neighborhood.",Industry 1332
114,"Those views though.Food is basic simple bar food, but in no means is it bad. Veggie burger available. Has alcohol. Dog friendly. Hidden local LIC gem with summer sunset views to die for.","Far end of LIC, this gem by the water was semi-hidden in an area that looked abandon. Low-key outdoor bar and great burgers.","Stopped by for beers on a Sunday afternoon on a holiday weekend.  I think a lot of people were away for the weekend because it was not nearly as crowded as we expected.  No line for drinks or food and no wait for bathrooms (which isn't typical, based on other reviews).  Anyway, we counted our blessings and enjoyed a picnic table by the water with a couple beers from their decent selection.  I was afraid to try the food, not knowing their health rating, but this was definitely a great choice for some day-drinking.  As everyone has mentioned, very much off the beaten path and I only knew it was there because I saw it from the ferry.  Lots of doggies (yay!) and quite a few kiddos (meh).  Laid-back spot to forget your troubles and the hustle bustle.","Such a beautiful view! If you are looking to have a relaxing summer evening this is the place for it. Nice beer selection, fun staff, fresh air and good energy. It gets very packed on the weekends so we came after work on a Wednesday and had a nice spot to sit. I will recommend this place to my friends.","A bit of.a walk from the 7 train,the view makes this a smart place for a drink or food.  Despite cheaper prices in Queens, this place isn't - because of said view.  I passed many signs along the way with $5 drink specials.  Here it was $10 for a wine - but that didn't surprise me much.  One friend thought the food prices were too high so we left after one drink and hit up John Vrowns which has huge plates for $15 ABD a good happy hour.This place is cash only and it's entirely outdoors.  I thought the wine was good - I'll come back sometime for a burger.","Come here for the beautiful views. Stay here for the beautiful views. Dealer's choice whether you'll find the food and drink a worthwhile part of making the trip. Nestled at the end of a dead end street that's filled with trucks and industrial looking things, you'd never know it's right there on the waterfront. Having used to run along the Gantries, I'm still surprised I never knew it was there. It seems you'd have to crane your head from the corner where'd you stand near the Pepsi sign, just to try and catch a glimpse.For that reason, it makes a lovely secluded outdoor patio space if you wanted to through a private event, informal or formal. And supposedly worrying about noise levels isn't an issue either nor bringing pets because of the purely outdoor nature of this place (read: also means, come on a fair weather day).I lean on the 3.5 star spectrum of this review simply because I wasn't wowed by their dish of fame, the çevapi. I guess I was running a little protein deficient that day, cause I was craving a massive burger or something despite having already eaten a very healthy dinner at home. I ordered the Balkan sausage and just found it to lack oomph in flavor, which made me more liable to balk (!) at the near entree price I paid. Others around me seemed to like the dish, though, so perhaps I'm an outlier. Customer subjectivity is simply the forever curveball in the delicate balance of the good food-good setting-good value trifecta. But, it IS irrefutable that the views from here are 10 out of 10, so definitely still visit for that and knock back a plain 'ol cold one while you're at it!",Anable Basin Sailing Bar & Grill
115,"Showed up at this restaurant out of pure convenience. Ahhhh such a cute little spot and the bartender/server gave an old lime. No, it's not harmful to use but other than the shitty appearance, those don't yield much juice. I usually just pass on squeezing it at all at that point. This did not kill my whole experience...I'm going to try going back bc I didn't try the food yet and they have high ratings.","We came for Friday lunch, I had the kale and quinoa bowl with avocado and shrimp, and my husband had the chicken salad sandwich with fries, everything was okay, but not something what we would come back for.","came here for brunch with my bro this past weekend.  the place was already packed with lots of soccer fans.  we were offered bar stool seating by the window.  it wasn't ideal but those were the only seats left.the food:-brunch potatoes:  chunk of fried potatoes with salt and pepper, no other herbs or seasonings.  VERY average that i could make it myself at home, not worth getting IMO.-brunch burgers with fries:  there's a fried egg, hollandaise, lettuce, tomatoes, lots of toppings but the patty was very bland.  it could really use some salt and pepper.  also, my brother and i both ordered this item, cooked medium, but mine was overcooked and trekking on the medium well side.  finally, serving this item on a huge wooden plank is sorta awkward, takes up too much room.the service slightly frazzled, as our seating arrangement made for some really confused runner who brought over other ppl's food over to us.  the food itself was aight, nothing special to write home about.  overall, i though this place was ok, i might stop by again if i'm in the neighborhood","""Only the People that are meant to be in your Life will come to your Life""In life we will see people come and go, is part of the normal process of living.  Some people will be in our lives for a short time, some for a while,  and some for too long.

I cannot bring my three kids to this restaurant.","My friend had told me about this place for years and since I've been craving Hainan Chicken for weeks, I finally decided to get on the 7 train and embark on this treacherous journey to the restaurant. For $8.99, you get a generous portion and a free drink. But the food itself is really just O-K. Not as great as people are raving it to be on yelp. The classic scallion ginger sauce is no where to be found. You could get similar quality chicken in Chinatown for about $2 more. The trip out there is really just not worth it. The restaurant itself is TINY. No bathroom and other diners are literally up close and personal to you. It's not comfortable. If I lived in the area, this would definitely be a take-out spot. But my advice is...there's literally no need to travel this far for mediocre Hainan Chicken.",This is very good Khao mun kaiRice very tasty chicken is moist sauce very good I will come back,"Absolutely love this place!! Warning- they only serve one menu so if you want variety, this is not a good option for you.The basic combo comes with chicken, ginger rice, and soup. Chicken is good, rice is great, but the dish that stole my heart is the soup. The soup has a strong chicken flavor with a hint of ginger. It is on the saltier side but goes perfectly with the ginger rice and the mild flavored steamed chicken. My friend and I ordered a set for 2 (around 20$ with tax and tip) and we left the place full and satisfied.","I bookmarked this spot ages ago thinking ""Yeah, right, like I'd ever be in Queens"". Sure enough, five years later, I was in Queens with Jamie W. making our way from the Unisphere to the Lemon King of Corona and then taking another half-hour or so to walk to Elmhurst amid the eclectic multi-unit houses with maximum security grillwork. When we finally made it to Broadway, it was lined with interchangeable shops and cafes, and we must have passed by it twice before realizing we found it. It was a tiny spot with just three tables and quite s takeout business from what I could tell.I loves me some khao mun gai, and that's all they serve here with servings set up for one, two, or three. The plucked chickens propped up on hooks through the warmer window was the dead giveaway (photo: bit.ly/31RaaXW). Naturally we ordered the $15.99 Set for Two - which was a poached and sliced boneless half-chicken breast with livers and gizzards on the side with two bowls of ginger-infused rice and two bowls of soup. That should have been enough, but I got cocky and ordered the $5 side of Livers and Gizzards neglecting to realize we were getting some already (photo: bit.ly/3216yTD)The cumulative pile of innards was not greeted warmly by Jamie, but I was kinda excited and frankly indulged. The chicken itself was tender though slightly on the lukewarm side, and the Innards gratefully had the right texture and consistency. The sauces were in jars on the table, a bit disappointing compared to a place like Savoy Kitchen on the Left Coast where they're served fresh in buckets by servers with big ladles (review: bit.ly/2KLT08s). Listen, if I was in Queens, I'd be a regular here because I love the stuff, and just in case you need to know, the restroom is a few doors down at Moo Thai Food because they share the same owners.FOOD - 4 stars...very good poached chicken and a whole lotta innards if you wantAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...tight space if you plan to dine hereSERVICE - 4 stars...nice and attentive TOTAL - 4 stars...khao mun gai in Queens...coolRELATED - Hungry in NYC?

118,"I love cheung fun (肠粉) -- rice noodle rolls. While cheung fun is usually found at dim sum restaurants, we luckily have two dedicated rice noodle shops in Downtown Flushing, on the opposite sides of the Roosevelt Avenue and Main Street intersection - Fu Yuan and Joe's Steamed Rice Rolls. Of the two, I generally prefer Fu Yuan's rice noodle rolls. Our usual order from Fu Yuan or Joe's Steamed Rice Rolls -- sometimes both -- is the beef rice noodle roll (牛粉). Joe's Steamed Rice Rolls makes thinner, more delicate noodles; and uses minced meat, which allows the meat to be more evenly distributed though the noodle. Fu Yuan makes simpler, slightly thicker and greasier noodles similar in texture to dim sum restaurants; and uses actual meat pieces, though with a higher noodle-to-meat ratio. You won't go wrong with Fu Yuan or Joe's Steamed Rice Rolls, but for me, Fu Yuan makes for a heartier comfort snack. While Joe's separately packs sauces for take-out, Fu Yuan generally includes the sauces in the noodle container. I'd recommend soy sauce, some peanut sauce, and a dash of sriracha.Fu Yuan is take-out, only. While you're at that specific corner of Downtown Flushing, consider visiting New Flushing Bakery two doors away for their regular and Portuguese egg tarts.Food and Value: Good (3 of 5). Service: Good (3 of 5). They speak English, Mandarin, and Cantonese.","Came here for the rice rolls. Fu Yuan quite literally is a hole in the wall. No seatings. Cash only. While there is something special about watching your rice rolls be made from scratch like at Joe's Steam Rice Roll, at Fu Yuan the plain rolls are already made in another room in the back and the protein and sauces are added when you order in front of you. So you do get your food faster. I like it here more versus Joe's because it just seems more authentic. Cheap, delicious, and a classic. I will come here for my future rice roll cravings when in the Flushing area. Too bad they don't sell beverages as well so it can be a one stop shop.","Spots like Fu Yuan are why I venture out to Flushing despite my dislike for large pushy crowds and crazy drivers. This no-nonsense hole in the wall serves freshly made rice rolls that are silky smooth and piping hot. The quality of the rice rolls are comparable to that of Hong Kong's, which is impressive! I usually get their curry fishball and rice roll combo, the perfect snack while cruising down Main Street. My only complaint is that curry flavor can use a bit more of a kick. Otherwise, prices are unbeatable and flavors are on point.","I was randomly walking around Flushing one day & saw a very long line outside this shop. I was curious so I lined up as well. I ordered the curry fish ball & rice noodle roll (chern fun) that had peanut sauce, soy sauce & sesame pieces on it. It was soooo delicious and extremely saucy! It reminded me of the ones that were sold in Hong Kong. It was super delicious, affordable, and the staff was very friendly - now I know why there was a long line. If I ever come back to flushing, I will eat here again!","When I'm looking for cheap Chinese food eats, this is one of my go to's. First off, I've been eating fish balls with the cheurng fun for as long as I remember when they sell it from food carts off Hester street in chinatown (you don't see that much these days). This gives me a sense of nostalgia when I come to fu yuan. They have different types of cheurng funs. They have regular fish balls and curry fish balls. If the cheurng fun is not you, they have pretty good congee and noodle soups. The shop is a really tiny hole in the wall. It probably fits 3-4 people, standing but everything is take out. Cash only.","This was where they filmed the movie ""A Fu Good Men"" and where Billy Joel recorded the song ""Only The Good Die Yuan.""I love this place and I don't even like fish balls, but the curry fish balls here are amazing.And if all fish balls were this good, I would probably get fish balls more often. Although they're not too healthy, LOL.I think I'll try the steamed rice rolls next time, because I love those a lot more generally speaking, from places such as the incomparable Joe's, and according to other reviews that's the secret go to item.",Fu Yuan
119,"Came to pho metro like two weeks ago... I think it was probably a Sunday? We came in with a particularly large party actually, like probably about 15 at like 4:00 pm or so.Well, there were a lot of orders, so I think they probably tried their best, but long story short they forgot evereyone's order but mine. When everyone had their dish, and I was still waiting, they came over to me to ask what it was again i ordered. I got kind of annoyed here, because instead of telling me straight up they forgot about my order, they denied it when I asked them if that was the case, even while everyone else was already eating.The food was fine. I ordered a spicy broth, but was somewhat disappointed that it wasn't a different kind of broth, but simply the same beef broth but with chili oil in it. Overall, not an awful experience, but certainly not a great one either.",The place was pretty crowded.  The food was okay but it was not hot.  I ordered a #1 and the beef stew.    The stew was bland.  One piece of carrot.  disappointing!,They keep taking my money. I got addicted and came here everyday for a week. I have to use mental exercises to tell myself stop. I highly recommend the #1 beef noodle. You can eat it everyday. It's amazing. Just do it. I'm an addict They're closed on mondays sadly,"Second visit, getting better each time. Great bowl of pho, soulful broth, not so much meat but very high quality with good rice noodles.Crunch rolls for appetizers were good but pricy for just 4 pieces.Clean tables, pleasing environment, clean bathroom, friendly service which is definitely not par for most Asian restaurants. Restaurant Grade rating is A.Parking in front is plentiful, eating here is just convenient and pleasing. I'm a fan.My kids all loved it, and they are pretty picky.","Honestly I am going to divert my review to Eric Y's excellent one (Also ROTD for 2/18/2019) since he describes in fantastic detail of what goes into making a great bowl of Pho and why so many other places in NYC get it wrong.Here is a bit from my experience:I came in early after work needing a good bowl of soup to help me fight a sinus infection that was screwing up my week. The Pho Dac Biet was the exact prescription I required. When my soup was served I could have done without the server asking me if I needed a fork which I found slightly insulting (I'm not even sure how I would approach Pho with a fork?)Although in my altered state I couldn't pick up on the exact subtleties of the beef and herbs, I could certainly feel the effects of this well made soup. The broth was silky with tiny beads a fat floating on the surface making for the perfect consistency to soothe my irritated throat and help improve my breathing. The noodles were perfect and all the ingredients very fresh. I enjoyed the Goi Chon Tom (Grilled Jumbo Shrimp Rolls in rice paper) and the peanut sauce that was served was not overly sweet as I find elsewhere and had a fantastic consistency almost like a pudding making it thick and clingy to the roll. Cafe (Coffee with Condensed Milk) over ice had a nice caramel flavor that went perfectly with the food. I look forward to coming back when I can fully enjoy all the food served here. I found the service overall very good and friendly. They have a parking lot, but as most places when it comes to cars and Flushing it is a crapfest - tight spots and confused traffic.","Really great Vietnamese cafe.  The Pho is very well flavored, and their vermicelli noodle dishes are very tasty - I try not to eat much meat but wow their grilled pork and chicken were sublime...(sorry animals).They also have amazing Vietnamese iced coffee - you know, where the coffee is super intense, aromatic, and dripped from that little metal top.  And oh yeah, condensed milk.  Bam.This is part of a little strip mall that's part of the larger Whitestone Lanes strip mall - free parking.  Also across the road from Whitestone Cinemas - so if you're looking for a cool place to eat dinner (or strong coffee) right before a movie, check this place out!  (P.S. Whitestone Cinema has also added coffee inside recently.  It's Starbucks brewed, not Vietnamese style.",Pho Metro
120,This came highly recommended and is an obvious local fave judging by the nonstop wait the second a table opens. But the fried stinky tofu was neither crispy nor flavor profile distinct and memorable. Nor was the oversauced oyster pancake. The pork belly w mustard over rice was just requisite and lacking a bit of kick & salt.,"A not so hidden (also not jam packed busy) staple for Taiwanese food in NYC. This place is so authentic. It opens to 2am so you can get your drunkchies or late night cravings in!My go to items here are the Cuttle Fish Pork Soup with Rice Vermicelli, Fried pork chop over rice, 3 cup chicken, and Water Spinach.If you come for late night (10pm to closing), they have a deal where you choose 2 dishes, plus Yam-Congee, for $20! WHAT A STEAL!BTW - THERE IS A PARKING LOT IN THE BACK! MUCH NEEDED FOR THIS AREA!","Taiwanese food? Huh This place is a disgrace to Taiwanese cuisine! The dishes either tasted old or way too salty. You can tell the chefs, didn't give a Crap!!! Just get the dishes out!!! The servers all looked unhappy & had that dont bother me for anything attitude. The decor is outdated & the parking lot is a danger zone! Everything I ordered besides the free tea was a disappointment. How can u call yourself a Authentic Taiwanese restaurant & your Braised Pork Over Rice was so shitty?FYI: ""Cash Only""",Wow so much foodBut left my mouth so dry and thirsty prob cuz of MSG$9 for my taiwan chicken and noodles.No veggie in it. But lots of chicken! Big portion.Server: angela was very nice and got our orders quick. We went after church around 2:30pm and got 2 big tables in the basement.,We've been coming here for Taiwanese food for years and we love it!  We come here either for a quick meal or for family style dinner. The food is great. The price is decent.  Our favorites for a quick meal are the Beef Noodle Soup & Pork Chop over rice. The braised pork over rice is great too!Other dishes that we love are:Salted crispy ChickenFlies headPork with dried bean curd3 cup chickenFYI: They have a small parking lot,"Probably been here more times then i have fingers, & toes. Their pork chop dish is their standout. Great spot to grab some good ole Asian cuisine w/o breaking the bank. Me, & the wife usually order one of their 'over rice' dishes (each), & call it an evening. Bottom line: tasty food, good portions; and, w/ a nice price. p.s., they're open till late. p.s.s., great for take out during the weekdays, after work.",Taiwanese Gourmet
121,"La Boulangerie may very well deserve the entire block on Austin Street on which it stands.The staff there is well-versed on their amazing creations/pastries and knows all about the ingredients that go into them. Extremely tasty products including coffee and espressos. They have a wide variety of loaves of bread from cornbread to sourdough to different types of whole wheat. All very tasty. In case you haven't noticed, I love this place.","Your pastries are so good but staffs are very RUDE. I was surprised by recently other comments in here said the same negative things about their service and I confirmed that too. It's not only one person but almost of all staffs here, they've problem with their serving attitude. I'd a bad  experience here and also seen they treated elderly persons with disrespectful too. Sorry La Boulangerie, you have an amazing food but running by unqualified staffs. I'm not recommend even take out.",I went to get Chicken soup because I have a cold. Hardly any soup and loaded with potatoes and sweet potatoes. $22. For two containers of Potato Soup. WTF,"That cheese danish though!!!That was quite literally my reaction to my husband once I was done! So a while back when my husband and I used to walk to forest hills, we passed this very cute shop. We stopped in but I don't think we ended up getting anything. Recently I asked if he remembered that cute little french bakery. I remembered not getting anything and I really want to try it out. On Saturday I ended up ordering Bareburger to pick up and passed this place by! How convenient.  I went in and was determined to pick something. I had told myself I'd get a fruit tart (all of which looked amazing), but once I got in, everything looked so good! It took me about 5 minutes to choose. Horrible I know. I tried to get something both my husband and I would enjoy. I got the blackberry cheese danish and the fresh apple beignet to take home. I was soooo full from my burger that I ate the pastries much later. I was taken back by how tasty they were! My husband favored the beignet so I let him have it. I was all about that cheese danish anyway. I told him it was hands down the best cheese danish I had ever experienced. It didn't disappoint. The danish was delicate and buttery and the cheese was lighty sweet and delicious. Brava! I'll be back. I have a sweet tooth!!","Friend & I stepped in for bfast on a Thursday morning around 11 am. Room small but spacious, decorated with lots of gold and wood brightened with lots of sunlight. It was not too busy, line moved quick and tables half filled with patrons. Looked over the baked/savory goods and wanted to eat everything! We ordered :French Toast - nothing special nor mediocre. Fluffy, no overbearing egg taste, whipped cream was not too sweet. Good overall.Merguez scrambled egg and cheese Crepe- took about 10-15 mins. Is it worth it? Debatable. Merguez seasoned and not greasy. Egg and cheese good, but crepe on dry side - lacking some type of sauce perhaps. Syrup helped.Iced chocolate - opposite of hot chocolate. Ice cold, not too watery/milky/chocolaty. Str8 Plain chocolate. No sugar / no salt - for sugary chocolate lovers or sea salt chocolate lovers , it'll leave you feeling it's lacking those components.Orange Soda - nothing special. on the less sweeter/more carbonated side.Chocolate chip brioche - looks dry, but actually really soft and savory in middle. Just enough choc. chips, really good.Price to portion/taste ratio is within standards. Overall it was a good experience after trying it out 2-3x but jsut not 5 star worthy. Bakery is probably more known for their baked goods vs. savory items.","The bakery actually serves decent pastries, but most of the staff are pretty rude. I am not saying everybody is rude there, because I have had a couple of decent customer experiences (far and too few in between).I have been coming here for years, but it is difficult to continue to come here with the staff's dismissive attitude. My friend joked and asked if they were going for the ""authentic"" French experience. I stayed in France and that is just an undeserving stereotype and unfortunately the staff are playing right into it. I will probably take a break for a little bit until I see some new faces or hear about a friendlier environment. Good luck!",La Boulangerie
122,"Definitely overpriced. We went there as groups of three. Each of us ends up $65!!! What kind of hot pot need to pay $65 for? I think they want you to buy a membership or the price will be extremely high for each item. The servers are rude, and I don't understand why they don't serve iced water. We had to ask for ice specifically!! Also, we have to grab water on our own several times because we waited too long. We are not going back again!","I've never heard of Xiang Hot Pot until my friend chose this spot for lunch. We got here early at 11:30 but they do not open for business until noon. I went to inquire if they give out numbers but they said not until noon. This was also when a middle-aged staff lady basically bum rushed my very pregnant self off to the side from behind and scurried into the kitchen/bathroom area. I was so shocked. Not to be a total jerk but it reminded me of the extremely rude behaviors I had come across in mainland China. No acknowledgement, no apologies. Even before they opened a good size crowd was beginning to form. The staff spoke mandarin and very minimal English but I believe they told me to scan the QR code to get a number... only they canceled my reservation scan out of nowhere and I had to do it again and of course ended up with a later number. It was very disorganized. The hostess was yelling out numbers in only mandarin to be seated and I told her a few times I don't understand and she would just nod me off. Mandarin-speaking customers with numbers after me would rush to the hostess and tell them their numbers and party size and would get seated before me - I know this because I at least kind of know my numbers one through ten in mandarin. I was furious. One customer noticed my frustration and did some translating for me. At least the restaurant is surprisingly HUGE so everyone gets seated rather quickly.Honestly after that hot mess of an introduction I didn't even want to be there. Luckily once we were seated the waiters and waitresses are MUCH better. More polite, helpful, and spoke English. The menus can be a little confusing as not everything had an English translation.This places charges $3 per person to use the sauce station. Can you believe that?! I've never seen that in my life. Horrid. Cheap. Unbelievable. The sauce station itself did not even have that many options. There weren't even basic things like sriracha nor sesame oil.The chicken skin skewer was gross as hell - I expected crispy skin with spices but it was cold rubbery skin with a hint of cooking wine and drizzled with chili oil. I wanted to barf but swallowed it because I was paying for that shit. We ordered a variety of items including taro, wagyu beef, fatty beef, fish ball with roe, chinese lettuce, A-choy, sole fish, fish tofu, Xiang noodles, enoki mushrooms, and more. Everything was pretty tasty but nonetheless standard hot pot food. We all agreed that the Xiang noodles was our favorite. The wagyu beef was kind of a waste for hot pot... very similar to the cheaper fatty beef if you're planning to dunk it in spicy broth anyway. I do not doubt their authenticity when it comes to their soup bases though. Bill came out to $180 for three adults and one toddler. We were stuffed but I will never come back again. I don't mind paying top dollar for good food but the service and lack of order that I experienced was just not okay. I don't appreciate having to act like fighting dogs in a ring trying to get seats because there's no civil order being followed.  Perhaps it'll be better if you visit during non peak hours. We went at opening time on a Saturday. I will say that when we finished lunch and left around 1:45pm, there were people waiting to get in. So perhaps a weekday?",This place was way too noisy and busy. I don't see what special to play music that loud while there were already so many people talking so loudly. Soups were not bad but food was just average but pricey. I've been to a few others in the area that probably worth the time waiting for a table and at that cost.,"Interior - traditional Chinese design, SO much room and so many tables. They also have plenty of seating outside for the waiting line, and they offer this machine that blows off the smell after your meal.Service - pretty good, nothing to complaint about! They speak mandarin.Taste - delicious!! One of the best hotpots I've had in New York so far. Extremely authentic and not TOO overpriced. The tomato soup base they offer is my favorite, and they got a station for dipping sauce so you can get whatever you like. all of their meat came in decent portion","I used to love coming here. It is pricy but the food is fresh, not as authentic as China, but it is very close, I was so grateful for this place to bring good hotpot to New York. However, I won't come here again because their service. One of the dude working here is extremely rude and had zero respect. We were a table of 2 and ordered 5 dishes. I came here all the time  so I know the portion. He looked at our menu and gave me the ""are you serious""look, then he asked me with a disgusting attitude, ""only 5 dishes?"" I told him I know the portion and if it's not enough I will order more. He rolled his eyes and left, didn't say anything. Then as we were eating our food, we wanted to try the bamboo shoot, and another waiter helped us, as he brought our food, this dude came back again and yelled at our waiter, ""It's not their food, they only ordered 5 dishes!"" The nicer waiter just put down our food and didn't say anything.Later, he came to our table and took away our water without asking, and then gave it to another table. I don't know what is going on with him and why he seems so miserable. But I hope that the restaurant take this issue seriously. It is a great restaurant and all the other employees are nice and working hard, don't let this guy go around and ruin other people's effort and your customers experience. I left the restaurant feeling very angry and disrespected. And definitely won't come back as long as he still works there.","High quality flavorful hot pot. If you get membership and put $$ down, you can get discounted pricing. It's still pricier than AYCE but the ingredients are definitely higher quality.This location is on the second floor of the New World Mall. The must have is the meter long premium beef, which is sliced so thinly it melts in your mouth. We also love the handmade shrimp paste which comes with masago on top. The portions are pretty small and but everything is prepared and sliced thinly so that it cooks quickly. They have a 1.5hr limit for busy times but doesn't seem to get enforced strictly. We usually get the double pot with mushroom soup base and mild spicy. You can carry out the mushroom soup after and use it as soup stock at home!",Xiang Hot Pot
123,"they have been forced to close by order of the new york city health department that is not a joke see pictures october 7,2019 stay away if you dont want to get very sick",The waiter had a horrible attitude. He added the tip on my check without asking me first. He did not even say come back another day. Dim lights and poor atmosphere. Never again.  At least the food was good.,"It is totally a SCAMMER, STAY AWAY.Pay attention to the receipt they give you, they already included a 15% tip in the bill with nothing mentioned and they ask you to give the tip again.Extremely not professional and shameful.  STAY AWAY.","Came here on a Sunday afternoon to have lunch for the first time & I had a good experience!!! Food was tasty, big portions & reasonable prices! My only criticism would be that they don't offer the ""green sauce"" which is typical pretty much anywhere you go for Peruvian food! They offer the rocoto sauce instead which I find bit too spicy & bitter for my taste. Other than that this is a good rest, I would come back to try more dishes:)","We love this place for delicious ceviche and food! YouCan't go wrong with that place! The only bad thing about it is honesty the parking but you obviously can take other ways of transportation to get there. The sangria is perfectly mixed with the right amount of liquor, juice, and fruits. The ceviche if you like the heat ask for spicy, if you don't like heat, ask for no picante. Either way it is delicious and one of the best Peruvian places in Queens. All of the food is flavorful and reminds us of Peru. Worth giving it a check especially if you would like to taste some Peruvian food !","I came here last night with friends for dinner. First time here and didn't expect food to be this good.We had Chorous a la Chalca (New Zealand mussels with lime, cilantros and tomatoes) a bit sour but in a good way, Creamy Fried Yucca, and Jalea!My favourite is this seafood fried rice, a bit salty but sooo good, perfect together with their Peru beer. Soup is good too. Great service!!Love it!Definitely coming back here for amazing food. Can't wait to try different things",Urubamba
124,"If I can give 0 stars- I would!!! Sadly me and my mom ordered food to go as we wanted to go home and eat with my grandma that isn't very capable of going out to eat. We ordered one hummus and 3 chicken kebabs ($75 total). When we got home all 3 of our orders had more raw chicken than cooked. We don't live that close but we called the restaurant to tell them. So the girl that works there said bring some back so I can show the chef and we'll get new ones ready for you. I thought that was the only right thing to do since it was a lot of money and they didn't want to refund us. We packed up almost ALL of the chicken into one tray and brought it back. So we got in the car, drove 20 minutes to get there for the Chef to come out and verbally attack my mom. Because we didn't have it in 3 separate trays? And that it wasn't the exact piece number that was given. So I guess he wanted us to take out of the garbage the raw meat we had all spit out? I was so appalled and quite frankly pissed off that any man thinks he has the right to speak to a woman in that way. He started screaming in Turkish and wouldn't speak English. He was mad we brought back raw chicken?! He said don't come back here anymore. How about you do your job & actually cook the chicken. We even then offered and said forget it we don't want more food just refund us, that's a lot of money for something you can't eat. And they refused. When I asked the girl if the chef was the owner she was very reluctant to answer, until I asked for the 3rd time and she said no he wasn't. Disgusting attitude for his own mistake. If he's not the owner I truly hope the owner comes across this review to see the way his/her chef conducts business. The first picture is from the first order and the second picture is what we went back for. More raw chicken. Sorry but you can get sick from eating raw chicken, & for that much money, it's incredible how they let the chef conduct himself that way.","Don't know why this place has such good reviews. Came in on a Thursday evening so it wasn't busy. Ordered an app platter. The hummus and lebne were amazing but i had one of the worst stuffed grapes ever. Next, we ordered falafels. The outside was so burnt and the inside wasn't even fully cooked. Now if the service was great i would have overlooked the lack of good food. But the service was just as bad. So disappointed. I was looking forward to a nice Mediterranean night out.Only good thing was the baklava that was on the house.","Food was good. Service was prompt. The gyro platter was very tasty. My husband had the meatballs and they were delicious. There were a few vacant tables, but we felt rushed. As soon as my husband finished they took his plate. When I placed my fork down the waitress was there within a second to grab my plate. I actually wasn't finished, but I wasn't  given an opportunity to respond - she took my plate. It's a shame because we really liked this place - initially.","I'm so happy that I found this place. I came here with my boyfriend for dinner.

Still we brought our bottle of wine and they didn't even charge for that ! Only thing Tuesday to Thursday they still do BYOB. We finished our dinner with desert. We got Kunefe and Rice Pudding.

125,This place has been closed everyone.  They put up a sign saying they will be going on a vacation for a week.  It's been more than a month and they are still closed.  I wonder what happened here....,"Avoid if you dislike salty and spicy food. I came here because of all the positive ratings on Yelp. But my experience with them wasn't quite as good. For starters, I ordered takeout and they forgot to put in my seafood pancake. Plus the food doesn't taste fresh, in fact I think they added way too much seasonings which aren't healthy. However the deal breaker is that I just found out last night they double charged me on my credit card. Going to call them today to get my money back. Anyway I am definitely not going back to this restaurant again.","tiny space, no public restroom. they have hand made Korean style Onigiri","Highlight: friendly staff, good portionsThis is another cute Korean mom and pop restaurant.

We came on a summer night and the AC was leaking water (it also just poured outside) so we told the owner and he was very grateful we told him. I ordered a chicken katsu which was crispy and juicy. The dish also included rice and cabbage. I also ordered a spicy bulgogi stew and it was very flavorful. It is on the spicy side and you see the chili oil but the onions and other seasonings gave it a kick of sweetness to balance out. Lastly, I ordered the classic kimbap roll and it was pretty big! Overall, me and my 2 friends were very full and satisfied with the food.","Mom and pop Korean restaurant with reasonable prices.Located on the corner of 149th st and Northern Blvd.Taking a look at the menu here, there were alot of different options that looked appealing. Ended up ordering the bulgogi pot and sharing a cheese kimbap. Looking back we should have shared the cheese dukboki. I saw it on the table to next to us and it looked really good. Mental note for next time.The bulgogi pot was good. The meat was tender and flavored nicely. Nothing too strong or too sweet. The portion sizes were also good, one thing I had worried about when I was ordering it. The pricing for the dish was also very reasonable. The cheese kimbap was okay, but nothing to write home about.Defintately will be back in the future, for the cheese dukboki and the other pots on the menu.","We were searching for an affordable Korean restaurant and came across Gossip House in Murray Hill, Queens. Located in the heart of Korean Queens, we found reasonably priced food cooked as if it were homemade. The restaurant is on Northern Boulevard and isn't hard to find with the big red awning outside. The restaurant itself isn't that big, but can seat perhaps 20 patrons. The menu is a simple two-sided menu with lots of common Korean dishes such as kimbap, pancakes, soups, rice dishes etc. We ordered a squid hot pot, a seafood pancake, a pork hot pot and a bibimbap. We were provided with 5 side dishes. Generally, the food tasted homemade.This is not a bad thing as the food seems unrushed and authentic. I felt the best of best of the bunch was the seafood pancake, then the two hot pots. The pancake was unusually crispy which I really enjoyed. The casseroles were not overly salty. The bibimbap which was served in a stone bowl could have been hotter. Unfortunately it wasn't hot enough to crisp the rice, however the ingredients inside were just fine. One of the best things about Gossip House's menu is there are many items between $6 to $9 and very few items over $12. You can really have an economical meal here without breaking the bank.As for the service, it was excellent as the waiters were attentive in filling water and taking orders. On one final note, we llked the interior of the restaurant because it was well-lit and had a friendly vibe to it. The jazz music in the background didn't hurt! Overall, I would highly recommend Gossip House because the value proposition.",Gossip House
126,"I've been here many times and the food used to be good. But the quality and quantity has been declining over the last few months. In their sandwiches, they hardly put any meat inside. It's like a very light spread of tuna or two pieces of ham. For the price, they shouldn't be so skimpy. Not to mention the older female owner always seems to have an attitude, which doesn't help.","I don't know how this place has almost 5 stars. We ordered two turkey paninos which has turkey, sundried tomato spread, smoked mozzarella and arugula. Just holding the sandwhich before taking a bite, I knew the bread was stale as hell. I took my first bite and not only was it beyond stale, the sandwich was mostly just bread. I hardly tasted what was inside the sandwhich, which lead me to my next issue with the sandwich. It hardly had anything in it. It had like two little slices of turkey, an extremely thin amount of spread (which got completely lost in the thick stale bread) and the mozzarella was NO WHERE to be seen. I was desperately searching for the smoked mozzarella and just before we were about to call to complain, I FINALLY found it. The thinnest slice of cheese I've ever seen in my life. It was so paper thin it actually got lost in the two slices of turkey. This was a $10 sandwich and for $5 less I could have went to my corner deli and gotten a sandwich that was LOADED and made with fresher tasting bread. I will never reccomend this extremely overly priced place as it is so not worth it in any way.",I literally died and ended up in Italy heaven by walking in here. I mean is there anything missing?!,"MAMA MIA!!!! I was missing my Rhode Island Federal Hill (aka da hill) and Charles Street amazing Italiano eats and shopping when I stumbled across this gem tucked on Queens Blvd. I was skeptical VERY until I took the chance and tried some of the autentico e delizioso  finds they have. Their Panini's made w caldo bel pane italiano soffocato in mozzarella reale e pomodori is a religious experience and immediately transported me back to my small state homeland and neighborhood  . Then I stacked my basket w several homemade salads , grilled eggplants , roasted red peppers and a number of delizioso  treats !!!! dear gods im salivating just typing about them ! I made it there on crutches so whats your excuse not to get there ? You Will LOVE THIS PLACE! 3 blocks off the F and E train (kew gardens stop) Mangiare e godere !!!  ciao","Very surprised with the good reviews! My family and I came to this establishment more than 15 times. Service had been average. The croissants are very good. Regular coffee is weak. The last visit... their machine had to be restarted. A special cup of coffee couldn't be made for a long while. I was asked to if I would like a regular coffee. I settle for it. The owner's daughter was busy chatting when we were leaving. Upon leaving, I asked if the prices for the regular and special coffee was different. She said yes. Then nothing was offered, neither refund or the coffee I ordered. I would like to see local small shops succeed. Alas, they have no concept of customer service or what is like to run a cafe. Besides the service being terrible. Check all the food you get from there. Lots of them already expired and are still on the shelves.",O. M. G. The panini di Parma with peppers is amazing. I can't believe it took me so long to come here,Cipollina Gourmet
127,"Very bad service. The place didn't seem very busy but the lady working there basically just ignored us. I rang the call bell, looked her in the eyes and she walked away. She served people that came in after us but just ignored us. Didn't even get served water. We just got up and left because no one would take our order.",Nope. No comparison to Mad For Chicken. Metered parking. So so atmosphere. I ordered the wings. Nothing to report,"Some of the finest fried chicken wings that I've ever had at this price point.  I ordered take out because I was under the assumption this was a crappy hole in the wall. IT ABSOLUTELY WAS NOT! I walked in, they had a few TV's and everyone was sitting around enjoying the Laker game. They had a few beers and soju bottles in the fridge which would be the perfect accompaniment for these little gems. The Soy glazed chicken wings and the soy dumplings were to die for.  Mind you, they sat in my car for a ride back to westchester county for about 25 minutes.  Cracked open the box and they were still warm and the wings were still crispy.",Food is always good here.A bit pricey but worth it.Try the soy garlic wings they are unbelievable,"Overhyped. Nothing stood out to me. Soy sauce fried chicken wings 3/5 - tasted a little burn to me and also slightly salty the more I ate. Mixed of wings and drumsticks; not as small as I read from other reviewers. Truffle oil French fries 2/5 - barely tasted the truffle. The sauces that came with it helped a lot or else it would taste just like unseasoned French fries. Quite pricey too for a splash of truffle oil. Service was nonexistent. Maybe Bc my sister and I came on an off hour (3:30ish), the only server there was a little busy packing to go orders which I don't blame him but can at least be a little friendly and act like he cares when he was serving us. Came here, tried, not coming back.","I prefer a Pelican to a Pelican't, but this is a Pelicana, so draw your own conclusions. Here's a pencil and a sketch pad - have fun with that.I always like KFC (but not the chain), and this is one of the better Korean chicken wing places. I liked Pelicana since the first time I tried it, and I've been to several locations all around the country actually. This one was one of my favourites, because it was the first one I went to, many years ago.However, on my most recent trip, I got here at about 12:45 on a night when they close at 2 a.m. and they said that they were no longer serving and that I couldn't even sit in there. After I was turned away, I noticed a gang of Asians showed up and they were seated and they ordered. I was just sitting in the car outside feeling rejected and discriminated against.I guess I kind of got treated like a homeless person, but I certainly wasn't looking like a homeless person. I'm sure if they knew who I was it would have been different, but I don't like to tell people who I am because then I can see how people really get treated.So in conclusion. Definitely a bad experience and that's why I'm taking a couple of star ratings away from them, and hopefully when I take Barbie back here they will be more friendly.Or should I say, if I bring her here.",Pelicana Chicken
128,"There is NOTHING zen about Panorama of My Silence-Heart. Do NOT let the costumes or art work and photos of  Sri Chinmoy fool you. This is a business. And they most certainly do not follow Chinmoy's path or existence, not common sense and good business practices.This was our second (and last) time ever coming here, which is really disappointing because I had high hopes that we discovered a new gem for grabbing breakfast or working peacefully while enjoying an acai bowl.Where to start. There are so many places.When we arrived Sunday morning, the place was pretty much empty, sans for a table that was finishing up at the front. There were three on staff, though not particularly eager to get to the counter, which was fine. I wanted time to decide. I ordered the BBB acai bowl and three eggs on the side. Seemed easy enough.Jayson, my husband, ordered oatmeal with coconut and fresh fruit, and tea.  I'm not sure what went wrong, but what I got was over-cooked, tasteless and slightly browned eggs that looked like they were made in a fryer or waffle iron. They were not edible. BUT, I took two bites, tried to doctor it with salt and pepper and then let it go. This was the first Sunday in a long time we both had off, and I didn't want to get it off to the wrong start. No biggie (well, had it ended there.)There may have been two people that came in after us, neither of which ordered anything complex or particularly difficult. I believe one was just a coffee or a tea.Anyway, for reason unknown, it took 22 minutes to get him his oat meal. I'm not sure where the coconut flavor was, but what they gave him tasted like sewer water. Literally. After tasting it, he politely went up to the woman at the counter and said that it had a vile taste and that he's like something else instead. It was not tasting right.Most places -- any place really -- would have said, no problem and simply replaced the dish. No harm, no fowl. But, she said no. It's their policy that once a customer has it, they can not return it.What? It's not his fault it was inedible and tasted like sewer water on a bad day. She refused and just smiled. He returned to the table very upset. It wasn't about the money, it was about the principal. Not to mention, we came there to eat something. So, she called the manager on the phone for him to speak to.The manager did NOT asking him what was wrong with it, why he didn't want it, how much he'd eaten (two small tea spoon full) or anything. She simply said that restaurants don't do that -- um, my husband has worked in two top Times Square restaurants as a server for the last 4 years, so that's 100% not true. She then said that once a customer tastes it, they can't. How can a diner find out the food is spoiled, rancid or just nasty tasting if they don't taste it and where is the accountability of the restaurant. She should Google that. Because I did, and most restaurants will automatically offer a guest another dish, especially if there's a problem with the taste or quality, rather than lose a customer. And we are talking about oatmeal, not filet Mignon. And, there was no way that point that I could even try to enjoy or find out if my acai bowl was decent, given that I was served NASTY and BURNT eggs that were made in some contraption, which I did not mention or make an issue of ... or after he waited 20 minutes (when there were no other orders or anyone here before us) to get sewer tasting oatmeal with no coconut flavor.Not only was this just bad restauranting ... it's just a lack of good business. What manager doesn't ask what the problem is and try to find a solution? Apparently, this manager never practiced or read up on  Sri Chinmoy's legacy or listen to his teachings because he would not be happy that she didn't even bother to simply inquire about the situation. She make a business decision (if you can call it that) without knowing a single fact (and no, the woman behind the counter didn't explain anything to her about the situation, she just dialed and handed him the phone). That's NOT a manager. That's literally someone phoning in work and not doing their job.This is a horribly bad place, with HORRIBLE service (even before this incident, the service was lacking severely) ... like when we walked in, the woman behind the counter was sitting at a table and couldn't be bothered to get up to do her job. She took her ""zen"" time to get there. The food is HORRIBLE.The only reason they even got the one star is because Yelp doesn't allow for none. Just look away and count your blessings that you chose elsewhere.And read up on  Sri Chinmoy, his teachings are amazing. It's sad to see his legacy tarnished in such a way.","I After eating the very watery, overpriced oatmeal, I Found a long dark curly hair close to the bottom of the bowl (I have straight blonde hair), the restaurant would not take it off our bill nor would they exchange it for another item. The staff had an attitude problem, and didn't seem to get how freaking gross that was!!!",PROSThe vegetarian only food in the place is fairly priced and somewhat cheap. The drinks are good and the sandwiches are great! And the employees are friendly according to my experience. CONSThe atmosphere was good but something about the cordination of colors and chairs seemed off. They have a small variety of desserts. There needs to be louder music the AC was louder then any music. And the place was empty but no one came to serve but they asked for tips at the check out.,"Experience 1. Black Coffee (Organic Sumatra)- delicate sour in, chocolate, roasty, non aggressive bitterness with bold tone2. Vegan Treats- haven't gotten to them yet but they look good.Service- busy but everything and everyone seemed peaceful and kind.Recommendations - I was in a rush and did not have enough time to chat with the associates. Some of their tags for they pastries were upside down and made it difficult to read the ingredients. Otherwise, the coffee was good and I plan on visiting again to try their cold brew.","What an incredible atmosphere! I have been driving all around Brooklyn and Queens for work and was looking for a quiet place to have some lunch and work. This place was exactly what I needed.I had an iced coffee (black) and a vegan chicken wrap. They were both fresh and flavorful. The ambiance was calm and bright with great chant music and a variety of seating options. Staff was warm and friendly, and quickly brought my order as I was making use of the excellent wifi.All in all, a great place to work or relax.","Talk about perfection wrapped up in a groovy, zen, spiritual and just all around comfortable setting. Named for, and inspired by,  Indian spiritual teacher, poet and composer Sri Chinmoy, it's a very peaceful place, echoing Chinmoy's well-known mediation practice. The decor and the clothing of the staff clearly take inspiration from Chinmoy's belief that peace could be manifested through silent meditation, music, poetry and art.While it prides itself as being a vegan/vegetarian restaurant, for those of us who want to turn and run when we hear either of those two words, it was easy to forget that's the staple here. They offer a wide variety of dishes, and a little taste of something for everyone. Honestly I only learned it was a vegan restaurant after we left, that's how good the food is.I ordered the Mediterranean omelette, with a third egg. It comes with sun-dried tomatoes, olives, onions and goat cheese, and it's served with a small side salad.It was delicious. Like, OMG melt in your mouth good. I wasn't crazy about the dressing for the salad, so I asked for the (vegan) blue cheese. But, the original dressing spilled over on my plate towards the end, and it would seem it wasn't as bland and blah as I originally thought. The good parts had just sunk to the bottom. But it was weird still.Jayson ordered the red velvet coffee and an Acai Super Hero Bowl with banana, blueberries, cashew milk, raw cocoa, mocha, chia seeds and topped with granola, chocolate nibs and strawberries.That was right up his watching his weight alley. He loved it. And it was so pretty too. He called it one of the best Acai bowls he's had.He didn't love the coffee, which is a shame, cause he's a man who loves good coffee. But, it wasn't a deal breaker.We'll definitely be back.",The Panorama of My Silence-Heart
129,"A coworker and I recently caught happy hour here. The place is classy while remaining casual, with all the modern rustic interior wood design and décor. I wish there were more red wines available on the menu by the glass, they mostly offer by whole bottles. But who am I to complain about a $4 glass of their house Cabernet Sauvignon? I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, which I typically do when a restaurant offers it - but I was quite disappointed by the preparation and texture. If there's something this dish should not be, it's CHEWY.","I found the food quite salty. The crab cake was not as salty however it did lack flavor. We did not try the entrees. Overall, it was just okay for the many choices of places in Flushing for drinks and appetizers.",Amazing food drinks and attention.It is No longer trendy to hang animal heads from the wall you should consider changing it.,"I love this place !!! Great environment very romantic , very pretty waitress btw ! Wink **The food is creative and elegant , though very reasonable price , They got a lot of cool events from times to time ,Like painting and flower arrangement class ,very romantic !! I would try to bring my friends here when I get a chance and they all love it ! Btw I recommend the truffle fries as a great snacks with wine ;)Ps.: Happy hour is lovely and lady Thursday !","This little Fairytale romantic lounge, Tavern 157 is located at the East part of Flushing, good looking waitresses, offering its Happy Hour in sophisticated  mixed drinks.We started with a Blood Orange Mojito and a Lychee Martini, all were very tasty.The starters came with the signature Fried Pork Skin Chips, and Foie Gras in Port wine sauce.The mains were Rack of Lambs, and Smoked Chilean Sea Bass. Perfect in tapas style, all fingerlicious and delicious!Before step inside, please keep in mind that the portion of each tapa is relatively small! Shouldn't  we get to complain the Michelin style portions in Midtown, then we shouldn't come to complain the portions in here, simply just because they are in Queens.We'd love to com back for more!","Came here Alanna few occasions with friends, it is a cute quaint romantic little place, that serves good food and drinks. Open really late.And they are always busy but to busy to get a seat to eat. My friend loves the oysters and the sea bass. The parmesan truffle fries are really good.The risotto cheese balls are good for starters.For drinks my favorite is the lychee drink. Very nice spot, definitely try!",Tavern 157
130,Food here was good for lunch. You can tell everything was made from scratch. Would come back to try the dinner menu,Everything we ate was tasteless and salty. We went for brunch and I got the fried chicken biscuit and my wife got the salmon benedict. The fried chicken was dry and way over cooked. The biscuit was like a rock. The salmon benedict was basically salt lick. My wife couldn't even eat it. Won't be coming back.,"Went here for brunch, and they were out of baked eggs so the only other egg option was taco salad. Given I have a gluten sensitivity I ordered it without the shell. What was left was a sad fried egg covering what amounted to two leaves of chopped romaine and  tablespoon of black beans (plus the other ingredients). Such a disappointment given all the other options seemed to contain gluten.Furthermore my table of four each ordered a bloody Mary and none of us were given olives. Which is fine, but when I asked for olives for our Mary's, we were charged $7 for the small plate of olives.A total rip off. Waiter was friendly but I would not return given the poor value.",Truly surprised that this place only has around a hundred something reviews. I got here around 8 on a Wednesday night. It was pretty empty. There was also outdoor seating but we sat inside because I can't stand the humidity. From the moment we went inside the hostess was so kind and attending. The ambiance of the restaurant was really nice and so clean. I had the salmon with Pinot Grigio and my date had the steak. For starters we had the tomato with sourdough. It was amazing. I still think about it to this day. The tomatoes were fresh and the sourdough was chewy and light. The salmon was cooked perfectly- crispy on the outside and nice and soft in the inside. The steak though was my favorite. Soooo juicy   Both the service and food was amazing. I will definitely be coming back to try other things on the menu!,"Ambience is good. I would've given better reviews if not for the service. I ordered the patty melt to be cooked medium rare. However, the patty melt was served medium. I didn't return the dish, and the patty melt was decent. My friend ordered the pasta with bacon, no issues there. I ordered a cappuccino after the meal. The waiter brought me a coffee drink - not a cappuccino. When I questioned if the drink was in fact a cappuccino, she said she will bring me the correct drink. After a few minutes, she came back and told me that the machine was not working so they can't make any drinks requiring steamed milk. Instead of telling me this from the beginning, she decided to bring me a substitute thinking I wouldn't notice and without checking with me.","My friends and I chose this restaurant to eat dinner at mainly because they had outdoor seating so I could bring my dog. I was very appreciative when the server sat us down and the first thing she did was give my dog a bowl of water before she even gave us water! Thank you for that. The menu is legible and has a lot of options to satisfy everyone. There's salad, pasta, seafood, meat, and even raw appetizers. Did I mention that this place has a Michelin Star? Definitely tasted liked it! Based on the servers recommendation we ordered the Watermelon Salad, Pesto spagatini, and summer risotto.I liked the watermelon salad mixed in with the feta and olive. It was a good balance. The plates do come in smaller portions so add on to your entree if you're hungry. The summer risotto was sweet because it had beets and peaches. I probably wouldn't order it again next time because I like hearty mushroom risottos but it was nicely done. One of my favorite was actually the side dish of sweet corn on the cob. The lime mayo seasoning was delicious. The establishment is very clean even with all their white walls and furniture. I loved everything down to the plates they served the food in. Thank you for the great service and food. I would love to come back for the cocktails and that warm sticky toffee cake!",Bellwether
131,"This review is specifically on the service provided. My husband and I are regulars at Banter, so we know it was not as busy as it sometimes could get when we walked in. There were still a few empty seats. We were promptly seated, however we were not given the menu nor water for 15+ minutes, while no one came to take our orders for another 20+ minutes. We always enjoyed the food, but we will not be coming back to Banter if the poor service persists.","Banter is usually a delight. However, this evening when we popped in for a dessert and drink, it was a disaster. The 2 waitresses were running around attempting to handle things the best they could. The hostess was sitting on her phone and literally picking her nose. They had an issue with a grub hub order and she was no use to helping this situation. When the lava cake came it was it cold and when our drinks arrived the entire ice ball had melted. We attempted to complain but there seemed to be no manager in site. It was a shame to see such disarray.","The crab cakes actually brought me to tears. Preface, I have had to suffer west coast shellfish for four years, so experiencing the taste of GOOD crab was an experience that can only be described as divine. The house beer, a honey ale, was worth way more than the five dollar pricetag. I stopped there on a whim during a six hour layover at JFK, and it has now become a regular spot whenever I am in New York.","I love this place. It is super cosy and very pleasant inside. There's outside seating too. I especially love our waitress, Tanya. She's so awesome. Their apps are so yummy that's all I really want to order, but their entrees are good too. I love the Irish 5 onion soup. Loved the dumplings. Love the crab cakes. Love the steak sandwich!!!!  I really like their French fries. My daughter loves their chicken burger. My son loves their nachos. Every dish that goes by looks awesome.       I'm always happy with my food here. It's a solid, consistent neighborhood place to go for brunch, lunch or dinner.",Trying to find a place to eat (restaurant not fast food) after a concert in Forest Hill can be like water water everywhere and none to drink. With the flock of people leaving post concert options unless you ate at the venue is packed. I saw Banter on Yelp. It was close and it looked like they had tables. Hallelujah! We arrived just before the rest of the hungry people arrived. This is your loud Irish sport bar with food. Sports of the tele. People talking many decibels above necessary but hey its a sports bar after all.The food was pretty good (either that or we were really hungry). Service was good even with the crowd. Our waitress got our order and drinks. My friends went for the burger and I picked the chicken burger. Usually chicken burger can be a dry mess but the chicken was tender topped with coleslaw and side of crispy thin fries. The burgers came with lettuce/tomato didn't have any complaints so it must have been good.,"Went for breakfast today.  Ordered 2 the Old Standard $24, Butter milk pancake $11, Three egg omelet $11, Side beans $3, 2 coffee $6 with unlimited refills.

The rest of the orders were excellent also!  Food 10/10, Service 10/10, Price 10/10, decor 8/10, a bit crowded.

132,"I have been to Szechuan Mountain house twice. They have both authentic and creative Sichuan dishes. The first time I had beef slices with Enoki mushroom in spicy sour soup, the second time I had la zi ji ( Sichuan fried chicken cubes with mountains of pepper corns and peppers ).",There are a lot of new Szechuan restaurants in flushing these days.  This is one of the better ones.  Decent selection of dishes and not overly spicy.   Service is decent.,"This is probably one of the worst Szechuan place I have ever had. The service here is slow, and unorganized. Have to ask the waitress to get rice twice. Order dishes and appetizers but dishes came before appetizer. Order soup which they are suppose to serve you and put them in a mini bowl for each individual which they did not....","TLDR: Szechuan cuisine in the heart of Flushing. Classic and modern dishes. A solid option for this kind of food and easy to park if you're driving. Pork intestines (ask for the crispy ones) and shrimp in the salted duck egg yolk.I've been coming to Szechuan Mountain House since they opened, before they got their second space started in Manhattan. I really like the interior design here and all over their dinnerware.If you're new to Szechuan, I'd recommend you inquire about the spiciness on the dishes. We have our ordering down to a system but here's what we usually order.Sliced beef and lamb tripe. If you're into offal cuts, this is a classic Szechuan dish. Thin slices of beef and lamb in a chili oil, this is served chilled. Super flavorful.Double-cooked pork. You can get this at a lot of restaurants but I like the flavor here, it's served with a lot of leeks which I love.Shrimp in salted duck egg yolk. Now, this is probably not great for you but that's why it tastes so good. The shrimp is stir-fried in the egg yolk which gives it this grainy texture. There's so much flavor in every bite. Wifey doesn't even like shrimp and always wants this.Pork intestines. Another offal dish but if you're adventurous, give this a try. The intestines are cut in small pieces and fried to a crisp. They're tossed with garlic, chili, peppercorn, onions. It's addicting eating this with a heaping spoon full of rice.Szechuan seafood. They offer this in Vancouver crab, shrimp and lobster. I've had all three - I personally like the lobster the best. It's a bit different from the normal preparation you'll see in a Chinese restaurant. The flavor will be the same in all three though. The lobster I feel is bit more than the shrimp but worth it. The crab is delicious but pricey.Stir-fried Chinese Long Beans. The beans are blistered and served with almost micro-diced mushrooms, ground pork and chilis. Of all the places I've tried this, I like they way they do it the best here.The line can get quite long on the weekends, it's very popular with the local crowd. Here's a tip, if you've got an idea on when you're planning to go - call ahead and ask for a Wait Number. This will place you in the queue en route to the restaurant. You may still have to wait a bit but I'd rather do 10 minutes than 45.","Came here today for late lunch. I think the food is pretty good, ordered Laziji chicken, spicy and sour beef soup and a vegi fried rice. The portion is pretty generous, everything was delicious. The jasmine infused tea of the house also better than free tea at any other Asian restaurants About service, i was kinda surprised bcuz i was prepared myself for grumpy rude Chinese servers. Comparing to other places, servers here are young, attentive and faster. I can see this restaurant putting efforts for better service than the market in Flushing, wanna mention I work in fine dining restaurants in Manhattan. They checked on the level of water for tea pot often, so we didnt have to raise hands for tea, also they came back to ask us how was the flavors. I didnt expect to receive fine dining experience but appreciated their efforts for sure! One thing they can improve is try to smile more oftn. The young man in white shirt gave us warm welcome and goodbye. Definitely will come back","This would be my first time experiencing authentic Szechuan food and believe me, I was not prepared for the spice.I really liked the atmosphere, since the restaurant had a sense of serenity and tranquility. The nature sounds and music themes really made me envision I was not in NYC. The service was top notch, the waitress was kind,  patient, and accommodating. I ordered the hanging pork belly, as an appetizer, which was delicious. As an entree, my wife ordered what I can consider a deconstructed pork belly sandwich. I ordered a super spicy fish soup, with pineapple fried rice (I apologize for the lack of detail in the names). We enjoyed the contrast in taste from the pork belly, which was fantastic. Now the fish soup was delicious, but painfully spicy. At least for me, there is a difference of spicy food and then there is Szechuan spice. It was a battle, and I loved every minute of it, as I used the rice to quench the spice. I glanced at the waitress and she seemed amused at my pain and suffering =). Overall, we had a great time, and I believe we experienced an authentic food experience with great service at a modest price. Be forewarned even if you're a fan of spicy foods, this place will test your limits for sure.",Szechuan Mountain House
133,"I am so aggravated with ayada at this moment.  I ordered for delivery and it took an hour for it to arrive.  I called multiple times and they don't even know what they're doing.  They keep saying they're busy so why didn't you tell me that when I called the first time that it would take long? And the delivery who is Spanish and wearing a blue jacket today needs to be fired.  You don't take my money and assume your tip.  You give the change and then accept tip.  Tip is not your decision; it is mine and that is what the delivery man did.  He just took the cash and assumed his tip.  Get better delivery people Ayada.  I expected more, especially since I've eaten there many times and ordered take out.  But this experience took away from all the good ones that I've had.","I am so aggravated with ayada at this moment.  I ordered for delivery and it took an hour for it to arrive.  I called multiple times and they don't even know what they're doing.  They keep saying they're busy so why didn't you tell me that when I called the first time that it would take long?

It was more of a confit than a noodle dish, all the ingredients slopping together into a limp, gooey mess. I did enjoy the chunks of garlic they threw in there, but unless I was desperate for a taste of pad kee mao I wouldn't be getting it from here again.","We stopped in on a Friday night around 8:30pm and waited 30 minutes for a table of four. Man, A+ for everything. This is going to be a long detailed review for one of the best meals we've had in queens, comparable to some we had in Thailand!Food:- bean thread salad: unique with light airy bean crisps! A few nice sized shrimps and a squid ring. Very distinct flavor and just chock full of different ingredients and herbs and spices. Went well with white rice!- beef tendon soup (dark with beef blood) - so rich and savory!! Tendon was cooked well and soft and chewy. This would be perfect on a wintry night!- fish cake appetizers - each patty (total of 8) was chewy and soft and paired fantastically with the dipping sauce. Definitely coming back for this!- pad kee mao with tofu - broad noodles were yummy and flavor was on point. Tofu puffs were soft and definitely better than other Thai places I've been to- fried fish with mango salad- fish was fried PERFECTLY and the inside meat was still juicy. Get the fish!!- chicken pineapple fried rice with cashew nuts- we got this because other reviews mentioned it. It was good, but I wouldn't come back for fried rice.- taro custard is more like a soft bread pudding consistency. The taro flavor was subtle but noticeable. It was so nice and warm!Decor was comfy and homey, and wait staff is quick and attentive. Cocktails were also delicious and not too sweet. $1 extra for a larger size!! It's clear they use fresh ingredients for everything and do not skimp!",Ayada lives up to its name as a no frills home food Thai eatery with a wait. The food is top notch with proper spice. Ok this visit I was veg with my fellow eaters and they really loved it all around. You can't go wrong coming here as this is a landmark spot that got them a space at Chelsea market!Sometimes the wait for the restroom can be painful!!I want tot go back!,"My friend took me here to get take outs. We ordered Tofu Pad Thai and Chicken Drunken Noodles, and they both tasted great! We tried their Thai iced tea, and it's good, but too sweet for me. The staff that accommodated us was nice too. Will definitely recommend this place.",Ayada Thai
134,"I always come here with a group of people after midterms! Their prices on the weekday lunches are a steal.. 12$ for AYCE then a la carte for the proteins.The only problem I have with this place is that they don't seat you until your whole party has arrived, EVEN IF you tell them that you would like your clock to start ticking now and the late person will end when we end.",This is a nice hot pot place. There is a large selection of vegetables. Dumplings and soups.  Meats and sea foods are extra.  The service is okay but during rush hours it's hard to get the server to fill your drinks.,"All hail to Spring, the almighty shabu-nopoly. All hail the Spring! It's the shabu shabu that everyone is (still) talking about, literally wiped out all of its nearby competitors. I guess it all comes down to quality food and portion, with affordable price. Yes, it's still ""spring"" when any one says they're craving shabu shabu. Can it be helped? No. Can we help but to go? No. Hands down monopoly. Pay up and go people!! But keep your 90min allowed time, because dude, other people gotta eat too.","What an amazing place! Perfect for plant eaters too. I love me some veggies. You can order meat on the side to add in. We have done with and without meat. There is such a variety of leafy greens, fresh noodles and more. This is an all you can eat place. Everyone gets there own soup option at the table. Great for groups of 4. My family has been coming here for almost a year now and we love it!There can be a wait of 30-45 minutes on busy days but for the most part time flies and before you know it you're chowing on some really good stuff. The servers have all been very nice!Get some fresh noodles! All the soup broths are really nice. I love the pork bone. My husband gets the spicy one. There is a sauce buffet area where you can make your own sauces to dip meat or add to the broths for more flavor. Oils, chilliest and topping galore like scallions and more..Did I mention the yummy soft serve vanilla and green tea ice cream to finish things off.. take it to go!","This place was so good. We waited for almost 45 minutes to be seated for a party of two and it was sooo worth it. I ordered the spicy bone broth (which I totally recommend) and initially the waiter brought out regular broth for me but came back and added the spice. After we got the broth we heated it to our liking with the little control knobs on every table and went up to the buffet. The buffet part is honestly what makes this place so good. We paid $17.99 each (which is cheaper than many hot pots at $25) and had unlimited food at the buffet. There's so many options too, I really just threw ingredients I know I liked into my pot and it tasted amazing. We also ordered the pork ($4) which was really worth it, the pork was so fresh and added so much flavor and was definitely enough for two people. The sauce is what makes the dish though, you can make your own sauce out of other sauces and dip your food it in and that was honestly the best part. My only complaint was that the service wasn't that great. I get that it's a buffet but our waiter only came to our table once for water refills. Also they close so early at 10pm on a Friday night and have everything gone from the buffet by around 9:30. Definitely worth the wait though, I'd love to come back during their $13 lunch special.","Delicious hot pot restaurant! AYCE fish balls, noodles, veggies. The meats and seafood are not included, and you have to pay additional $4 - $6 for meat plates, or $5 - $7 for seafood plates. Their ingredients are always pretty fresh and I have yet to have a bad meal at Spring. I have been here 4 times so far and have always left stuffed and satisThey also have delicious soft serve green tea and vanilla ice cream. I would recommend the swirl. Delicious! The only downside is the service can be hit or miss depending on which server you get. But they all seem to help each other out. It can also get pretty busy. You can expect at least an hour wait during weekend dinner hours.",Spring Shabu-Shabu
135,"2 crab empanadas and 1 tecate beer in a bottle. $22.87 was my total. So I'm assuming that's $6 maybe $7 for the tecate, which puts the crab empanadas at $14. Ok fair enough, but these are Manhattan or Montauk prices, not middle village or Glendale pricing. Service was not great. I could tell the moment I sat at the bar that it would be bad because the bar itself is super unorganized. Beer labels pointing all sorts of way, liquor bottles on the shelf a mess. The barback didn't know where to place my crab empanadas, I had to direct him to me. The crib empanadas seemed to have been placed in a wet dish because one side of them was crispy and the other very soggy. Gross. The empanadas weren't too bad, but unpleasant to eat with them being half soggy. I was going to stay and try to catch the Yankees game here, but not such a good experience. Bartender might need help. Also, check your receipts. I overheard the waitress and bartender conversing about adding auto tip to checks and no longer being timid to do so. I still tipped about 22%, but I doubt I'd ever come back here for any reason. Now that Metro Taco is open I'll just hit that for amazing Mexican food, and the usual suspects of Hangar 11 or Cobblestones Pub for sports.","Located right on woodhaven blvd, they have free valet parking. The vibe was nice, the dj was spinning some good music and it was loud and vibrant on the inside. Our server was very good. I really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately i need to be honest and say the food was really not great at all. And when you throw in the prices they charge, its a major let down. The quesadillas were bad. We got both chicken and steak. The chefs special was the volcanito, which consisted of jumbo shrimp, chorizo, skirt steak with fried cheese. It was not great. The steak tacos were ok, but for the price all you get is 3 tacos, no rice and beans, which is a way overpay. The drinks were meh at best.However the ladies night $2 margaritas is awesome. Overall i would not come back here. I really hate to leave negative reviews but i have to be honest here.","If i can give no stars i would, first and foremost owner has no clue on what the hell is going on, everyone here including the owner is dominican. This is not authentic mexican food. The food is s*** you have to wait a whole hour for the food to come out. The waiters are clueless no common sense and do not speak English. Most of these reviews are fake! Do yourself a favor and do not go here unless you want cold crappy food. Drinks are okay. Also, this place is extremely over priced. All those Google reviews are FAKE FAKE FAKE !","good thing this place stays open late, bad thing is that there is no parking around and have to park far away.unfortunately they don't have god selection of fish plates, only fish taco's......so I ordered fish tacos and coke to drink; coke tasted like if there was small amount of alcohol in it, what I suspect is that glass was used for some alcoholic beverage and wasn't washed good, or some small amount of alcohol dropped in it....  at end i barely drank it. In beginning I wanted to tell bartender (I sat at a bar area) but she wasn't anywhere around, well she was washing something at other end and wasn't paying attention to other end or at least that's how I felt....   so I gave up. Taco plate was very small, three tiny tacos with tiny amount of fish, which costs $15 roughly, definitely too expensive, taste wise it was as but I think it's a sliced that I was primary tasting.all together my bill was $20rbis place has good vibe/atmosphere, has bar area and normal tables to sit down restaurant style. I guess if you drink it maybe a decent place to come over but food, well not for me but definitely for allot of others.","I stopped by the restaurant with my husband, Steve, after a visit to Forest Park in April. It was that time between late lunch and early dinner, so we had the place pretty much to ourselves.The staff was very attentive and aimed to please. We seated ourselves in one of the booths that line the wall and took in the view of the eclectic artwork and artifacts on display. The manager approached us and suggested a classic margarita, which I ordered, along with a Diet Coke for my husband, who was driving. We then had a friendly chat with Juan about our mutual love for the Yankees before he told us the story of his restaurant's soft opening in late 2017 and the ""magic mirror"" on the wall.Fresh guacamole was prepared for us right at our table and the chips had come straight out of the oven. Steve ordered Tacos del Pastor: Pineapple marinated shredded pork, topped with red onions, cilantro, roasted pineapple chunks & salsa de arbol. I ordered a Wild Mushroom and Spinach Quesadilla, filled with a blend of Chihuahua, Oaxaca and Manchego cheese. The presentation was neat, and the food was delicious.We did not have room for dessert but their selection, including chocolate lava souffle and guava flan, sounded intriguing.","Been here an extra 2x. Food is not as savory as of late. Brunch use to also get you two drinks and entree. Now it is one and you pay $6 for the bottled water. That price doesn't reflect the area. I'm not sure how many others I want to show this restaurant too as it isn't as great as before. I'm not trying to show like I know what is best, but after 6 visits here I am talking about what I know to be true. If the prices go up, I expect the food quality to stay the same (if not go up) and I find that to not be true.",Don Tequila Urban Cantina
136,Been going here since I actually lived in Glendale in the '70's. This was always our favorite German Restaurant and would travel 1.5 hrs each way from NJ in traffic just to eat here.  This past visit on Saturday 8/10 was so awful I don't think we will ever go back.  Service was fine but Food was so awful we wondered if they sold the place or got a new chef.  Such a shame.  Their food and desserts were always so phenomenal that no other German place could compete.  Don't know what happened. ‍,"People talk about this place all the time. Went to try it with my friends and honestly don't understand the hype. The food is okay, nothing great. Kind of expensive for ok food and the staff isn't that friendly. It's cool to say I've gone but don't think Id go back","Food is 4. Service is 2.5 for me.  I am sure there are other people who gets warm service.  It is unfortunately that we have to think in our heads "" is it because we are looking a little bit different than the usual costumer base there?""  We stand there being ignored as many servers passed by not acknowledging our presence and not making any eye contact for a good 5 to 10 mins.  No smiles.  Restaurant was moderately busy but I don't think it has anything to do with that.  We understand that individual could have bad days.  But it seems to be a collective thing there. New York has a lot of unique restaurants.  We do not not need to go where we do not feel welcomed.  Will not be going back.","My family has been coming here for years (and by years I really mean generations). My parents grew up coming to Zum Stammtisch when my grandparents lived in Ridgewood, and they carried that tradition forward when my sister, cousins and I were growing up. Prior to this most recent visit, it had been years since I visited Zum Stammtisch, but I'm happy to say that this place still delivers quality, both in terms of food and service.To start with the basics, Zum Stammtisch is a traditional German restaurant. In fact, the German derivation of the name means ""family table"". The inside of the restaurant almost feels like a combination of a tavern and a German hunting lodge, featuring dark wood furniture, rustic lighting, and Bavarian decor.Service here is also top notch. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and very service-oriented. We were here to visit my uncle's birthday, so she also offered to take several pictures of us and made sure they were ""social media worthy"".Finally, let's talk about the food. My family is very predictable in the sense that we all crave Sauerbraten (call it a family tradition). Sauerbraten is not easy to make (it takes days) and it's quite simple to screw up (much like slow-roasted southern style brisket). Nevertheless, Zum Stammtisch doesn't fail to deliver. The sauerbraten is tender (can cut with a fork) and covered with sweet-and-sour gravy. The side of red cabbage and dumplings (traditional for this dish) are also made perfectly here. In addition, every meal begins with free bread service (so good), and the beverage selections are on point (plenty of German beers and lots more to choose from).There's not many of these places left, so I'm glad Zum Stammtisch is still around. It's a classic German restaurant that focuses on service, food quality, and family. If you love German food, this place is a must. If you don't like German food, this place might convince you otherwise.","From the outside, Zum Stammtisch reminded me of Germany. The feel continues inside. It looks just like a German beer hall and took me straight back to Munich and Hamburg. From that moment on, I knew this was the real deal and was super excited.My husband and I came here on a Friday night for dinner. It was busy, but not super crowded. The menu appears to line up with what I have seen in my travels through Germany.Overall, the food tasted pretty authentic and was complete with large German portions! My husband ordered the bratwurst and knockwurst with home fries. The waitress brought mustard over for him; I was excited to have some of the sweet and spicy mustard like in the Hofbrauhaus. Too bad it was standard brown mustard. His dish was good, but I enjoyed mine more. I ordered the veal cordon bleu (comes with home fries) with a side of purple cabbage. I loved how cheesy my dish was -- it was dripping out and some cheese was even toasted in the fryer as it leaked out! The breading was thin and crispy. On the whole the dish was salty, creamy, and crunchy. I quite enjoyed it.My husband and I had a great dining experience. I would definitely come back to experience a bit of Germany in the U.S. Next time, we'll have to try some beer!","Ok solid four stars over here for now; I'm new to this German joint but I'm a regular at Octoberfest & let me tell this place has delicious authentic German  favorites that will not disappoint !!!Love the old charm inside well decorated with a lots of nostalgia even the waitresses wear theses cute uniforms .....Very friendly staff in place, we arrived a Lil early about 11:45am thinking we would have to wait until 12 noon when the restaurant opens but to our surprise their were 8 people already at the bar .... We ordered some appetizers; their jumbo Pretzel & their kasespatzle .... the pretzel was very good along with their honey mustard & german deli mustard & the horseradish sauce which was my favorite!!! The Kasespatzle was like the best I've ever had ... loved the Swiss & onions & bacon bits !!! ( we shared that between the three of us next time I would get that for my meal )Dinner was awesome as well; we all went with the chicken hunter; the portion was huge and it was delicious the brown sauce & mushrooms as well as their home fries .... "" Go here Hungry "" we all ate our left overs for dinner !!! Desert; really had no room but we had to try their homemade apple strudel & whip cream which was another home run ....We have another German restaurant to go head to head with Octoberfest !!!Can't wait to explore the rest of their menu .....Funny thing..... one of my co workers use to work in the kitchen .... MASBOO and he always bragged to us how good the food was and we use to laugh because he's from Iran and we use to say what do you know about German food ??  Lmao, but he was right !!! Thanks,Greg D & family",Zum Stammtisch
137,"Pio Pio, is PIO PIO. it's delish every time. Simple. MATADOR is the biggest bang for your buck. For $42 you get a whole chicken. Salchipapa. Salad w/ avocado. A side order of rice & beans. And a side order of tostones or maduros. It's all amazing. It's inexpensive. You're almost always quickly seated. But on a busy day, it may take a while before your waiter comes to your table. Still very much worth it in every sense. I've been coming here with family since I was just a kid and it is still our go to. The food is just to die. MY OPINION !","Horrible service. The host first seated people who came after us. When we gently told him after that he skipped us, he basically showed no remorse. When we were finally seated, we waited about 7 minutes...no water, nothing. It wasn't even busy. Look at the pic. We finally just left out of frustration. This restaurant thinks they can do no wrong because it's well known, but this was a fail. I won't be going back.",The worst service I have ever experienced!The waiters ignore you and after waiting for over an hour for our food The chicken was RAW! I will NEVER return here again! Warning stay away from this location!,Sangria sangria sangria!!! I absolutely loved this place! We were a party of 6 and needed up ordering 3 pitchers of sangria 2 red and 1 white. The red is better ¯\(  )/¯ just saying! Chicken was juicy and flavorful. My friend ordered...I believe it was called arroz con mariscos and it was absolutely delicious! Everything we ordered here was amazing. Keep in mind this is a family style restaurant and the plates are large! The atmosphere is very laid back and lax and the attire is very casual as well. Definitely recommend if you're hungry and with a group of friends looking for good Peruvian food.,"The Camarones Cuzco is pretty good! Not sure I found the sauce as to die for as everyone else in the comments, it was a little watery. But the dish was overall good & still worth it!Pass on the calamari, we added a ton of salt (if there was lemon we added that too), did everything we could and it tasted like nothing. As avid calamari lovers we were so disappointed, it's rare that we find ourselves not finishing a plate. Ambiance is pnice, bumps the meal up from a 3.5 to a 4!","The Camarones Cuzco is pretty good!

138,"Amazing Uzbek food, friendly service (English is so so, but I speak Russian so no barrier here) and prices like you're in the 90s. Get the cheburekhi, skewers, and pilaf...actually just get one of everything! Fully wheelchair accessible, including the restroom.","Every time you pass by this place during the prime times, the smells from the grill just draw you in. It definitely drew me and my friends in.The menu is quite extensive and for someone who's never had Uzbeki food, I was a total noob Googling all of the names. There are pictures in the menu, but they're very poor quality.My friends and I ordered:* chebureki with mushrooms* chebureki with veal* samcy* babaganoush* lamb ribs kebab* Chilean sea bass kebab* veal sweetbread kebab* salmon kebab* Chersi drinks - 1 tarragon and 1 duchesse pear* green baklava* chak chakAll of the food was phenomenal. The seasonings are just right, and they give you a red dill sauce for the dough products that isn't overpowering. The drinks didn't taste like anything special. It reminded me oddly of those 3 for $1 chubby drinks I grew up with. The baklava was way too sweet so I had to scrape off a lot of the sugar and then wash my mouth with water.The reason why this review is missing a star is because of the service. The waitress doesn't know much English so she wasn't much help to amateur eaters. When we were nearing the end of dessert, she disappeared for quite some time and the other waitress who just started her shift was instructed to work the other side of the restaurant. All we wanted was our waitress to give us our check so we can pay for it. There were only 2 tables of 3 by the way and then one group was starting to come in.All in all, I would recommend this place. Don't expect great service, just come for the food.",I'm beyond disgusted with this place. The service has become beyond horrible. It took me over 40 minutes to get a soft drink. When the food came it's surrounded with dead flys on the plate. They got my order wrong multiple times in the same night. I advise everyone to stay far away from this place.,Great food I really like the service the meat is very good The place is clean and the service is very fastThe bread is so crunchy Will definitely come back again,"Absolutely worst place by cleanliness in this area , tables were dirty , and host told us to have a seat on one of those tables with dirty dishes on it , that's ok , understandable maybe you guys busy , but if you expecting full restaurant how 2 waiters can handle 40 tables ? We waited for food about 15-20 min , which was pretty good , but the was how they serving you food is Unacceptable!!! Lady gave me plate soup with her finger in my soup , and she just wiped it out of her jeans!!!! Silverware was throwing by some 14 year old on our table without any napkin wrapped around. And much more happened that night ..Looks like you get what you paying for. Food was 8 out of 10 .","If you are looking for some authentic Uzbek/Russian/Kazakh food, this is the place. The food worth 1 hour train ride. I got shashlyk, lagman, samsy and chebureki.I gotta tell you, this is by far the best shashlyk I tried around nyc! Lagman was too salty/spicy for me, but I usually prefer food on a blander side. I got pastries to go, just tried Cheburek, it was good, very good. Waiting for my friends to try samsa...The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is service. I wasn't offered a water and hmmm I had to ask for a sauce that was missing on my table...So don't have high expectations for the service, and enjoy a really cheap and great food.",Cheburechnaya
139,"Nothings special there, service is poor, and they cheating the costumer, because they already add the 18% tips on bill and they still require tips on final bills, looks still they want more tips, how crazy",Food quality is good but service is very bad. Overpriced and staff are rude and makes inappropriate fun of people.,"Just had the worse experience ever order from Bajeko Sekuwa using Uber Eats. First, Bajeko told us to use Uber Eats because they do not do normal delivery. So we ordered on Uber Eats; the food was delivered but we only got less than half of our food! Second, we called Bajeko and the man on the phone was completely unhelpful. He told me it was Uber Eats fault and there was absolutely nothing he could do (that we would be charged in full including delivery food and also not get the rest of our order, which apparently was sitting in their restaurant). Thanks for ruining NYE dinner. You have responsibility when the services you recommend fail. Also - you need to work with your partner (Uber Eats) and figure out a way to help your customers. Unbelievable. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!! Do not do delivery from this place as it seems they are not able to control delivery and will only blame their partner.","Every time I go to Sunnyside Queens I always get a hankering for South Asian cuisine. The choices aren't as numerous as say Jackson Heights, but there's always one spot that doesn't disappoint. I'm glad to have found Bajeko Sekuwa for a lot of reasons.First, it's a very good location. They're right on Queens Boulevard! The only drawback to that is the parking isn't as good as other less travelled areas but I had already found street parking, so that wasn't my concern. It is very conveniently centrally located.Second, the service is very nice. The man in charge was a nice gentleman who made sure we got our seats and menus as soon as possible and later served us the food. I'm not someone that needs a lot of attention but the people here are very pleasant.Third, the food was delicious. I admit I don't know anything about Nepali cuisine. In fact some of the entrees seemed to be Indian but perhaps they were Nepali versions of things we recognize from Indian cuisine. My mother and I had palak paneer and some kind of eggplant curry. Both were very nicely done. And the nan bread was better than any other nan bread I had in recent memory.Although I give this restaurant five stars no place is perfect so I'll go over the imperfections.First, the speed from ordering to receiving food is a bit slow. I won't take any stars away for that because the food is good and good food takes time but if you're on a limited time interval for your meal, definitely take that into account.Second I thought it was slightly above average priced. But again I don't fault them for that because the food is good, the service is good, and the location is very convenient and I'm sure all those things jack up their expenses so that doesn't bother me. I certainly wouldn't go elsewhere just because it's a dollar cheaper because that's penny wise and pound foolish we all deserve to spoil ourselves if the food is good.Overall, outstanding restaurant. The next time I return to Sunnyside I'm definitely coming back.","Solid 4 stars. A bit slow and a small place that was not overly busy (to my eye). Good prices and near the subway / easy access.Had a duck app thay i did not like/would not recommend.  But the Tandori chicken dish and the bean - lental dish were excellent,  especially when eaten together. Paired with good service,  i recommend this place.","Ventured to try Nepalese food again.  Among the dishes, the jhol momos were submerged in a tasty sauce; however, I felt I've had heartier and meatier momos at several establishments in Jackson Heights.  The butter chicken masala was extremely savory, with tender pieces of meat strewn in a viscous concoction that beckoned for a delicious balance from the accompanying rice.  The garlic naan was crispy and delicious and magnified by dipping into the masala, a possibly uncustomary technique.  The puffed rice from the khaja set was snack-like and ethereal.  The dal bhat contained an assortment of interesting flavors and textures, from the mild lentil soup to the refreshing curd.  The lamb chops, while tender, did not appear to be medium but were slightly overcooked.  As a gourmand of nontraditional items, I loved the hodgepodge of goat head parts in the tauko fry, from the cartilaginous crisp of the ear to the chewiness and richness of the cheek.  The bhutan was also great, as the intestines were evocative of the elasticity in Cantonese deep fried pork intestine.  The best item was decidedly barbecue with the bandel sekuwa; the boar meat must've originated from the belly given their juiciness; in hindsight I would've preferred to replace either the khaja or dal bhat with an additional order of those meat cubes.  The rasmalai was pretty good and on the sweeter side.  Service was attentive as the manager carefully delineated menu items; a candle on my dessert to acknowledge my birthday was also a nice touch.",Bajeko Sekuwa
140,"This review is kind of overdue, but I came here with a large group on a Sunday about two weeks ago and it was definitely one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. There were probably only two other large groups seated outside with us and barely anyone sitting inside, yet the service was dreadfully slow. We started off with the fries and ribs which were decent and definitely the best dishes out of everything we ordered. I got the scallops for my main dish and those things stank something fierce. Pretty sure one of my friends got food poisoning the next day because of them. The bed of risotto it was served on was horrendous and had the consistency of day old rice mixed with milk pudding.2/10 will never come back.","Pros: Great price, atmosphere, drinks, pasta, chicken wings,  quesadillas. GREAT pasta. I had their carbonara. It was a bit saucy (as other review mentioned) but delish. It went well with their flat bread. Con: do not get their ribs. It's cold and dry. One of the worst ribs i had in a while. (thats why they got 4 stars).","Ordered the spicy fried-chicken sandwich to-go, so I can only comment on the food (consumed within 5 minutes).The sandwich was slightly better than Chick-fil-A. Fries were decent. Would order again.","Live around the restaurant, but never went until last week. I've already ate at sweet sap 3 times this week! Everything I've tried here is sooo goood. The wings, for sure, the rib eye and ribs too. Make sure you get matcha panna cotta. Amazing.I really hope this restaurant stays open. A lot of restaurants that open here tend to close sooner than expected. It would be a total shame if this gem closed.","Showcasing an elegant exterior design for patrons to enjoy starlit evening cuisines, Sweet Sap is a great place to take a date. There are some places you passionately want to succeed, because you believe in their business model, and I really want this place to succeed. Friday night we were looking to slow down things a bit, a stark contrast to last week's events. As we came in, we were greeted with smiles from all the staff, which is a great indication of the service. We decided to sit outside, since the weather was beautiful. To start we ordered fried calamari and as entrees, I ordered the pan seared scallops with truffle fries and the wife had the Carbonara Pasta. Everything was delicious and came extremely fast to the point the waiter had to joke and apologize for the super fast service. One thing, the calamari appetizer was a little too greasy, but just my preference. As aforementioned the service was on point. Apart from the food, I couldn't stop thinking how relaxing the atmosphere was, which is probably what they are going for, no? The lighting was quite romantic and mood setting and the music, comforting. I must reiterate how pleasant our Friday dinner was, however I'm concerned about how empty the restaurant was, especially for a Friday evening. I'm hoping they get more business, because this place really deserves it. It delivers on all levels and the potential is there. They got my business for sure, as I'm looking forward to try their brunch over the weekend.","Food : 4 of 5The portions are good and prices are very reasonable. A casual menu where most of the dishes are on point.Atmosphere : 4 of 5 Its small and pretty. A chill sweet vibe is provided. Wish the lighting was lower. Sometimes it feels like im dining at someones home and NOT in a good way.Service : 2 of 5The servers are not rude or mean. Its just not good at ALL. Its like high school students.  They think they know everything but the lack of experience actually shows. Once called in to ask if we can byob a bottle of wine. The person who picked up the phone didnt know the answer and after a few minutes of waiting on the phone says ""its a $100 a bottle"".  Easily could have said that the restaurant does not allow byob instead of giving the most ""####"" answer ever!",The Sweet Sap
141,"I am disappointed to post this review, but I believe it is worthy of documenting my experience here.I visited with my family, and observed a small neighborhood self serve eats offering food by the pound.My family took turns going to the stations, and was rudely advised to refrain from video recording the premises. The cashier was worried about restaurant copy -cats from video which I politely explained trying to get a good angle via panorama to post on yelp. 3 servers approached me at once and I found the overall encounter upsetting and disturbing. 2 others strictly spoke in a different language to me. Cringe worthy. Discriminating. Disturbing.There are certain approaches to express concerns and these guys were rude and displayed gang mentality by way of bullying.The food stations were typical buffet islands of random ethnic foods and nothing spectacular or worthy of replicating. You toss out plastic plates upon finishing and you discard the trash in an outdoor garbage can on your way out the door.I will not be sharing the photos I took and 2 of my family members refused to even plate food deciding instead to not eat. To address the food, well it's a given when you leave without finishing what you paid for and prefer to throw it in the garbage instead of packing it away.Dry flaky salmon, rubbery chunks of steak, brown rice, beans, spaghetti & meatballs were among the food my family selected. None were fresh.If you somehow mess up rice/beans/spaghetti you should not be in the business of food preparation. Salmon was bland and they did not like it. Most ended up being shown to the trash. The petty rectangular stale chocolates the cashier came by and dropped off to my kids interrupted our meal- my oldest tried it and politely spit it out in her napkin. Rest were placed on the plastic plates and thrown into the garbage.As customers we kept our area clean, did not disrupt nor cause a scene, cleaned up after ourselves, paid for the food, and remained calm until our family finished their meals. We left our table clean. Unlike some of the other tables I observed where customers just left.This is not the best Brazilian restaurant in Queens or anywhere. With terrible basic customer service skills and the dummy account to counter my honest review, I begin to question the validity of the rest of their reviews. This place is not good, the people are not good and the visit was not good. Aside from quality of food at an establishment, the ambiance, attitude and service is important. I generously received a ONE star experience here for all of the above and will not be returning. Not one thing was good.After posting this review, I received a message from the restaurant. Image attached. Shameless!!Further, the owner Sidney continue to harass, send threats and has now resorted to lying. Video surveillance will be welcomed, as that will build my case and demonstrate us being compliant customers and prove how horrendous you and your staff are. This behavior is unacceptable and quite elementary.I refrained to escalate based on consideration to their establishment but due to Sidney's continued harassment, proper notices to appropriate authorities have been notified. I will no longer engage in communication with this fast food joint. Not worth my while.Beware upon entering this establishment. You have been fairly warned.Note: The review posted by Sidney C. (The owner) has since been removed. Thank you to the Yelp team for remaining fair in careful assessment. I am very glad to be part of a supporting team.","I visited this restaurant very often at least 3 times a week. I work and buy food on the go. Although I find the food tasty, it is usually cold since it's on a smorgasbord. It's also on the expensive on the weight scale. I also find one of the brothers,  the one at the register very rude. Never has a pleasant attitude. After all we the customers deserve to be treated cordially. He doesn't have customer service manners. I stopped going there last week.","I would give this place 0 Stars if i could.This place served me and my family expired cake. My sister went in to buy a slice of tres leches cake. Which is kinda like a sweet milk cake. We went home right after which took about three minutes since we live close by. The cake turned out to expired and had a sour smell and taste. We went back to tell the cashier and she didn't apologize or seem to care whatsoever. She just took our cake and threw it away and told us to pick something else. No cash refunds either. We told her that we were worried that the other customers might get sick since the whole cake they had was probably expired but she just said ""it's alright, they won't complain"" I'm just shocked and speechless. We been coming here for about 2 years now but this is utterly ridiculous. We will never ever come back again and i'm advising all my friends to do the same.","Delicious, freash, with a wide variety.  Cashier was also very nice and helpful with information on some of the foods that I was unfamiliar with.  They are also open late:  I will definitely be back.",Def this is the best restaurant I've been here in NY.The food is authentic and very flavorful exactly the way must be. Also wanna mention the employees are very friendly and showed Us around.,"Loved their food! I stacked a plate full of different kinds of meats cooked Brazilian style, loved all of them. The place is small and cramped but you know how it goes around here...very comfortable atmosphere. Makes you feel like you are somewhere foreign.",Aroma Brazil Restaurant
142,"Stopped in for lunch a little before 3PMPlace was completely emptyOrdered Hainanese Chicken and Curry Beef Belly.Chicken was good. Rice okay, a bit soggy.Curry beef was not tender enough; curry lacked flavor.Service awful - only server in the place was preoccupied with his iphone; let it blast random videos the whole time.","We ordered appetizer- grilled octopus, hainanese chicken and chili crab as this was one of the hottest dish. Grill octopus was decent. Tasted almost similar to what you can find in Taiwans night market. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the chili crab. First, it came out warm, not hot. I thought it was normal but found out there was a pond of sticky, slimy liquid. Server told us it was egg white and it's totally normal but who would eat raw egg white with this dish? I've tried Singapore chili crab, definitely no raw egg white. Most importantly, the server sounds like he doesn't care to ask us if we want to get another dish or offer anything else. Worst experience ever. However you can come and try their hainanese chicken, it was not the best I've tried but is good to try out.","I used to come here when it was Joah, a korean fusion place. They opened up upstairs so it was spacious. Upon walking up the stairs, there were tvs on the wall with chinese concert karoke on which I didnt mind because i like chinese songs! For a party of 4 and 2 babies, we ordered: Soft shell crab with chilli sauce: This was tasty, i liked the fried buns that came with it. Wished that our rice had came so we could pour the sauce over.Singapore Cai Tow Keuh: supposedly a popular Singaporean street food dish which is a stir-fried raddish cake. It was good but lack the radish taste.Oyster Omelette: big oysters and the sauce that goes with it was tasty.Hainanese Chicken: this dish took the longest to come. The chicken was tender but nothing special. Hainanese rice: this was the best, very flavorful, oily and garlicy! Even my son ate it and he's a picky eater.Yummy Tummy pineapple special: Do not order! this was the worst. It was basically iced water with a slice of pineapple. No clue what's so special about it. Service was super slow and lacking. I'm not sure if it's because we were seated upstairs and the AC was on super cold.","Been here twice on a weekend night for dinner with a group, and the food is just solid all around. Excellent blend of flavor and textures in every bite, and the waiters are quick and attentive. Spacious place with cute decor too, perfect for insta hah.My favorites: - oysters omelette. The accompanying dried fish sauce is so good! Good handful of juicy oysters in the basket and the omelette is fried to perfection. I could eat this one by myself over rice :P- pork belly fried rice with preserved vegetables!! Generous chunks of diced pork belly with a runny egg on top. Huge portion too- black pepper prawns and crabs. $28 but worth the try at least once. the sauce is so buttery!! A handful of tables ordered seafood here - radish cake omelette was so good, we ordered a second one - the whole hainanese chicken is worth the $36. The meat was so smooth and tender, even my grouchy picky parents loved it! Also, THEY TAKE THE BONES OUT! made it very enjoyable and easy to eat- French beans with minced pork is a yummy vegetable dish. Amazing with rice!- herbal pork soup with mushroom. Very herbacious and rich. Definitely get it to share for cold weather Things to skip: cuttlefish black ink pasta (not much flavor from the ink), hokkien noodles in broth (soggy mixed noodles), kaya toast (some jam on slightly toasted white bread). They were ok... but lacking in flavor/texture when compared to the other amazing items.We're definitely going back to try more food here. Really good for groups to share food and get a taste of everything. There were a few people waiting on a Saturday evening around 8pm but it wasn't too crazy.","Only a couple of authentic Singaporean food places in NYC and this is one of the good ones. My boyfriend and I have tried other Singaporean/ Malaysian places in Manhattan and Queens and have been disappointed by many. Located in the heart of Korean Flushing, Yummy Tummy is a strong contender. We overheard the owner having a long heart to heart conversation about Singaporean cuisine with a table of Singaporean customers. It was pretty cute! That's how you know the food is legit! We had the Otah Otah (my boyfriend's childhood favorite snack). It was my first time trying and I thought it was a bit interesting. It was a spicy and sweet fish paste wrapped in banana leaf. The texture reminded me of scrambled eggs. I recommend the Cai Tow Kueh which is like a stir fried radish cake. It's soft, sweet and savory. We also got the Singapore Chili Sauce crab. The gravy sauce was so good! It was a thick spicy tomato egg base. It came with fried buns to dip in the sauce. I was tempted to order some rice to eat with the leftover gravy. Unfortunately, the blue crab was a disappointment. It was a lot of effort peeling and gnawing at the shells with very little meat. The crabs were also very small and the meat was a bit soggy, probably previously frozen and then thawed. The sauce  flavor was spot on but the choice of crab could be better. I found out later that they offer Dungeness crab but you have to order a day in advance. That would probably have made the dish much better.  We finished our meal off with Bah Kut Teh (a pork herb soup). My boyfriend and I both liked it a lot. It was very rich and comforting. However, I would not recommend for everyone because of the herbal taste. If you don't like the taste of Chinese herbal soups then don't get it. I would like to come back another time and try other items on their menu!","Wow this Singaporean restaurant really amazed me this weekend! It has been on my radar ever since it opened, but I've been iffy about it due to the fluctuating reviews. First of all, the restaurant is very nicely decorated with a homey feel to it. It's modern at the same time and quite chic. Food was spectacular. We both really loved their house special crab chili with fettuccini. Their sweet chili sauce was amazing, tho I must say not spicy at all (for those who are expecting a kick to it) they had huge prawns which were awesome and the crab (if you have the patience to pick out all the little meats) were so tender and delicious. The crab and the sauce were really the star of the show. The hainanese chicken was excellent in terms of texture but I must say lacking in some flavor. They give you an interesting pesto and chili sauce on the side but I'm a little more used to the soy sauce version. However, the texture of the chicken was perfection and it was very juicy and tender. We really loved their oyster omelette as well ! It's not the most appealing in terms of looks, but it's super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with lots of oysters in it ! Particularly loved the sauce that comes with it. We had to ask for a second round of sauce, because one wasn't enoughWe also gave the kaya toast a try since I know this is a Singaporean staple. I've never had one before so I can't say if it's truly authentic, but I really enjoyed it. Didn't care for the toast on the outside too much since it's just bread, but the coconut jam on the inside was so delightful and had the perfect amount of sweetness. I was really impressed with this place and can't wait to come back to try their other dishes !",Yummy Tummy Asian Bistro
143,"The food is yummy but it's in very small portions. I did not like that they charged a $8 credit card fee and then when it was charged, the waitress said the operating system rounded it up to $9. They did not advertise it anywhere in the menu or any signs around in the restaurant, which is very shady.","A great little hidden gem - tucked away in Woodside around the corner from Sri Pra Phai  Fantastic culinary chops using Jackson Heights Greenmarket as a main source of ingredients.Short menu - 7 appetizers & 7 main courses - but no selection has failed to amaze yet.  Scallops, black bass and Paella (much more of a risotto- style dish)..  by all means, get the fiddleheads & ramps if available and the Ecuadorian chocolate for dessert.","I'm sorry i just do not understand why this place has such high reviews. It is definitely over rated. The decor is plain. The ""booth"" was uncomfortable and you can hear everyone's conversations. The place is small and tight. The food is mediocre and over priced. Not to mention it took over a half an hour to get my appetizers. Also the food is bland and portions are small. The only thing that was good is the service. Too bad because that's not enough for me to go back.","Hidden little gem!Casa del Chef is a wonderful little restaurant in Woodside that can for sure hold its own on a more high end block.  The menu, food, and service are exceptional.  We randomly found this spot (I forget how) but so happy we did.  This place is sooo easy to miss-its sooo small.  There is probably 8-10 tables, but its cozy and the 4-5 times we have been here, there is never a wait.  Decor is super minimal which is good since the space is so small already.  Chef Alfonso is a food genius that has never disappointed.  We get the very fairly priced tasting menu every time, and love that we get something new each time as the chef stays on top of seasonal ingredients.  But what blows me and my husband away is the Yogurt Pannacotta.  OMG.  I will start by saying it isn't always on the menu-which needs to change because its amazing and it needs to be a permanent item.  It is by far the best pannacotta I have ever had.  Indescribable deliciousness.  My only complaint is that its small-not a sharing dessert.  I hope they stick around-Deserves to earn a Michelin star.","Don't understand the ratings in here but not only the food is bland is also expensive.Scallop appetizer consist in one scallop with a very bland tomato sauce with raw zucchini.Pork belly brisket is a very thin slice of burn pork belly cover by a lot of arugula.Duck, steak and osobucco were just bad and expensive for quantity.Panacotta dessert was sooooo small.Maybe the increase prices and small portions are a sign of struggle.Should not be call casa del chef more like casa of a cook .Good service good decor otherwise skipped.","Saw the great reviews and decide to visit this spot as it is relatively close to my home.  Warm welcome and I went during a very quiet time and the staff were very attentive with my water and changing plates between courses. The pork belly was quite tasty with a nice mix of fat and pork and done very nicely.  Also tried the risotto and it was very good. The rice was not too soft and many nice size shrimps in the plate. The only complaint is that there is a 3.99% credit card surcharge on the bill!!! There was a very little sign on the back of the menu that notes this charge but when nyc restaurants already have high enough taxes and tip requirement. I really feel a lot better if you just up the price on the menu by what you need to to cover the charge instead of leaving a very negative thought as the customer leaves your establishment. In addition, this may impact how people tip as it is happening at time of payment. This is the only restaurant that directly applies it to customers that I can recall.",Casa Del Chef
144,"I am saddened to only give Little Pepper only a 3 rating.  I have been eating at this establishment when it was on Roosevelt Avenue and have been a fan for a long time.  If this review was done last year, it would have been 5 stars.However, I have noticed a recent general decrease in quality.For example.The Beef & Ox Tripe in Chili Sauce, once an amazing go to no doubt appetizer, now often comes out with flavors that are off and also notably has shrunken to half its size in the past year.  The Dried Sauteed String Bean which tastes great with a touch of char, often comes out tragically burnt.I've given up trying to make up it's just a bad day excuses for them.What is the reason for this slippage?  The chef/owner.  Depending on the day, if he is inside actively cooking, the food will be just as good as it was in the past.  If he is off or outside minding the restaurant, his underlings aren't good, which is a shame.","This is the worst tasting spicy fish in this type of style, it doesn't not taste good at all. The scallions fried rice has a nice flavor however it was a lot too soft and soggy. At last the sweet and spurs pork was terrible. It was soggy and the meat has a porky stinky taste. We can't really eat it. Overall we was excited to try little pepper but very much regret it pretty much want it throw the whole order away.",WORST restaurant I have ever had. Get rid of it please!!Food was found spoiled and stink. The owner just ignored the complaint and did not apologize. And was told that the food quality varies all the time and is hard to keep it fresh. Hope that Dept of Health  shut this ridiculous restaurant down asap. Extremely bad customer service. It is Evil!,"Dan Dan noodle, scallion fried rice and Mapo tofu are the best plates I usually get. The place is nice with cute atmosphere music around,  and workers are not that friendly.","Yep, Szechuan for sure so ask for no spice  for anything mild.Braised fish in hot oil: fish takes on hotness nicely and is super flaky and filled with wonderful hot pepper spice.Dan Dan noodles were my least fave. Just a ginger spice that didn't light my fire.Pork belly appy that keeps the fire going as it is cut like thick bacon, was. not thrilling. Spices bring me back to China. Scallion fried rice was good, not overwhelmed like the posts would lead me to believe. Good none the less.Mao Pu tofu,  is tasty but I can't get past the heavy, hot oil. Not their fault, my own palate. Love it on a hot pot broth. Tofu that doesn't fall apart is key how it was a bit too soft for my liking.A dedicated Szechuan cooking experience if you enjoy spicy and the hot oil taste.","Loved the food here! Stopped by for lunch on Sunday at noon and my husband and I had the place to ourselves, but a lot of people seemed to order takeout. The two men working there were attentive and helpful whenever we needed something. We got an assortment of dishes: dan dan noodles, mapo tofu, pork with bean curd, wonton in chili oil, and scallion fried rice. Our favorite dish was the dan dan noodles. It was the most authentic and delicious dan dan noodles we've ever had. The mapo tofu was also another favorite. The numbing sensation it gives and the slightly sour taste went so well with the hot rice. If we had to pick a least favorite dish it would be the wontons. They were seasoned too sweetly for us and the bright pink meat for me personally was off-putting. The pork with bean curd was good but way too salty for us. We barely touched the dish and ended up recooking it at home. Once the saltiness was lessened, we got to enjoy the umami seasoning with numbing spices.  We def want to come back here to try other dishes in the menu.",Little Pepper
145,"I've been to Pye Boat Noodle multiple times. It's like my dinner go to on a Wednesday night or my Sunday late brunch.My usual order is the boat noodle with beef. Some other dishes I recommend are:boat noodle with porktom yum noodleLarb-mooService is very prompt. I'm usually halfway on my beer and the food is already out. TIP: Their lunch and dinner prices are different, but same serving.","I'm having a real hard time remembering the specifics of this place, since I came at some point in the summer of 2018. I ordered... what the hell did I order? I think I got the tom yum bolarn noodle, which is kind of the seafood option. I believe it cost 9.95, and was reasonably filling. I think we also got a side order of chicken wings, but I cannot remember exactly. This place has a outdoor section in the back which looked closed, but is probably open during the summer when there are too many people inside the store. Overall a nice experience!","When are these people going to get a life? What do they do all day besides harassing people who leave bad reviews? They literally are the creepiest stalkers i have ever seen. Since yelping is their full time job i can see why they cant seem to run their business correctly. They have literally stalked me for 4 consecutive weeks liking and stalking every single post or following my user at all times of the day and night. They literally go to sleep thinking about me. Yelp has already warned them of their behavior, but since they have so many fake users reviewing their own restaurant. It takes time for yelp to review all of them. Toxic owners who could not take responsibility for their own mistakes, instead of just apologizing and moving on they continued their childish behavior. I really have never seen such a joke for a owner. The experience ive had with this restaurant is almost surreal. I have literally seen at least 15 fake reviews. The food whether at this point when i went was delicious or not is irrelevant. The service (mix up with the food) was the reason i left an original review. The food was incredibly spicy and inedible. I personally did not enjoy the service the treatment I received from my server and the incorrect order that was served to me. ** original review. Disgusting digusting. Horrible server who refused to acknowledge that she messed up our order, and tried to have us pay for her mistake. Ive never had an establishment who failed to rectify their mistake. She came back to the table upset and yelling at us. Her coworkers asked her why she had such a bad attitude and she just put her hands up in the air and said i dont care i dont care.To the owner: It seems like you need glasses then. If you ""reviewed the tapes"" you would have seen us, and seen your extremely rude waitress. Considering my bowl was full when she brought it back was proof enough. Her interactions with us at the end was even worse when she yelled at us while she was walking away. If we enjoyed our time, why would we write a bad review? That doesn't even make sense. I have no problem reviewing and giving 5 stars to places that deserve it in my neighborhood. Your server really is the reason you guys deserve a 1.P.s the owner's wife or server (someone who is clearly afflicted with the business, harasses and stalks you if you leave a bad review. They literally stalk your account, its funny thinking about how someone who has so much time in their life to do that. They also have several fake accounts to review their own restaurant and accounts to harass others who also leave bad reviews. So its time to think about how many negative reviews must have been taken down due to this type of harassment. It makes sense why this particular and peculiar owner couldnt take responsibility for their toxic staff because they are just as toxic.","Cheap, authentic thai food. They give you the fish sauce / small spice sauces Thai spicy can be pretty spicy so be careful if you cant handle spicy food Got 3 dishes and one thai tea - bill was only 38 bucks. Food came out quickly - service was good. Cute little spot and reminds me of thailand","I had been a frequent customer at their UES location before it was closed. The Astoria location is a lot more spacious and has a more lively vibe. If only it were closer to where I live! I've tried their kaprow, which was at a ""comfortable"" spice level for me, and boat noodle with beef, which was very flavorful with authentic southeast asian beef balls. However, my absolute favorite is Sukhothai. So good. You can't go wrong with this dish if you have high tolerance for spicy food as it's not just simply spicy. As a lover of all spices, I really appreciate the Thai zing to this dish.I gave it four stars instead of five because of the lackluster appetizers - was never impressed and always end up thinking, ""should've skipped.""Wish they would reopen in Manhattan but I'll happily trek northeast when I need my thai noodle fix.","The food here is gorgeous to look at and tastes fresh and authentic.  Servings aren't as big as some the other Thai restaurants I've been to, but the food is quite good.  We ordered chicken pad thai, beef pad se ew, chive pancakes, moo ping (marinated pork skewers) and pork pad ukk (pork with sautéed veggies over rice and fried egg). For drinks, we had the frozen watermelon and a Thai iced tea.The chicken pad Thai was bomb.  It was slightly sweeter than I was expecting but so was very tasty.  The noodles were delicate and thin.  And you can use the various condiments at the table to customize the dish to your taste. The beef pad sew was another delicious dish.  I would have liked the noodles to have been more al dente as they were slightly overdone.  Delicious nonetheless. Our favorite dish was the moo ping appetizer.  It was grilled to perfection and had a great aroma.  The meat was very tender and melted in your mouth.  The frozen watermelon drink was okay.  It was refreshing and was a wonderful accompaniment to our meal.  I just wished it had more of the watermelon flavor I was looking for.I must note that the staff were incredibly friendly and attentive.  They were always making sure our waters were full.I love the ambience of this restaurant.  The wooden panels, plantation shutters, Thai décor are all very charming. The restaurant has a back-seating area that is really lovely especially at night when the lights are turned on.  Unfortunately, the night we visited there were a lot of mosquitoes. I think this was due to the large fountain in the middle of the back-seating area. It was very hard to enjoy our food when we were being bitten alive.  I wished I could have taken my time to enjoy our meal, but we just couldn't handle the mosquitoes.  I strongly recommend that you wear some bug repellent if you plan on dining in the back.  This was the only sour note that marred an otherwise lovely visit.",Pye Boat Noodle
146,Food is good  here Prices was fair But the wait was a killer We went Saturday at 730 Was not seated till 930 !!! Worth a try if u can get a table in a decent amount of time,"The absolute WORST mussels marinara I ever have had. In a town where some of the best Greek restaurants are found I actually think I may have found the worst, and not even close to being authentic Greek.",Food was great. Fresh. Our waitress messed up the only entree we ordered and gave us the wrong seafood combo. when i mentioned it she made sure to repeat 5x over how she tunes out anything after she hears the word broiled..like what? Lolol? Pics are deceiving on here they look way larger than in person but quality was delish. the shrimp were way overcooked but Besides that and the attitude from the waitress for a simple piece of feedback on her lack of listening to a single order id still comeback just to try what we actually ordered (greek combo),"8/18/19 Enjoyed a lovely lunch here after visiting a nearby Museum.We started with complimentary buttery seasoned bread. Then we decided to share a bunch of appetizers and sample some Greek Faviorites. We ordered the mixed dip platter with pita. It had 4 different dips, Greek Olives, fresh tomatoes, and toasty pita squares. Each dip was super fresh and tasty. We appreciated the separate spoons served for each individual dip. Then we had Spanakopita. It was so fresh. We devoured this. The Horitaki (Peasant Greek Salad) was also wonderful. It was served with a large slab of feta cheese. So fresh and flavorful. We also tried the Loukaniko. It was very tasty. We squeezed fresh lemon over it and it brought out the flavor even more. For dessert we shared the Lemon Sorbetto. A lovely lemon sorbet served inside a hollowed out lemon. This was delightfully refreshing. The service was great. During our meal there was a huge downpour and the restaurant became very crowded with patrons trying to get out of the rain. The staff remained friendly and professional, never appearing overwhelmed.Overall great, fresh, flavorful food and good service. We will be back.","Tried the Bronzino, shrimp scampi stuffed with crab meat, salmon, sangria and calamari.The scampi was returned because neither of us were willing to take the hit to it. The service was good at accepting and offering alternatives.Based on my experience with Bronzino, their broiled Bronzino, in my humble opinion, should have been better seasoned or just better.The salmon was cooked good but it was not well seasoned.We really wanted to like this establishment more...See this review. Regarding the seasoning, that was what I noticed to. yelp.com/biz/psari-seafo…","I know that Astoria, Queens is known for great Greek food so I was excited to try Psari, especially after just having come back from Greece a few weeks prior. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed. Psari was a serious hit or miss.I wanted to start with mussels in white sauce but they were out of mussels, so instead I started with the Greek salad. It was fresh but their feta didn't impress me. I also ordered the half pitcher of white sangria which was well made no real complaints there except that the pitcher is TINY. A half is good for one person only so don't be fooled.For entrees we ordered the Stuffed filet (with crabmeat) and the Greek Combo (crab legs, scallops, lobster tail, stuffed shrimp & baked clams). Everything was simply just disappointing not to mention everything tasted the same which is absurd. There wasn't much variation in flavor on all on anything which was honestly the worst part. The filet actually had zero flavor yet the crab meat that was in it was completely over seasoned. In fact majority of the food was way too heavily seasoned to enjoy the actual seafood. The ""bread crumbs"" on the baked clams was way too thick and overpowering. The crab legs were pretty good but that was about the only thing that was good. The shrimp was not memorable and again the stuffing was the same stuffing that was in everything else. The only thing that I can highlight here is the bread and the lemon potatoes. The potatoes were excellent but am I really coming to a restaurant just for potatoes? Nope! This place isn't terrible but I would not go back. Sorry, Psari.",Psari Seafood Restaurant & Bar

I got grilled chicken (pollo a la plancha which is $1 more) salad greens roasted sweet potato picked onions and I added avocado (95 cents more) and grilled corn ($1 more). I am totally full hours later. Generous portions. Fresh ingredients. So flavorful. Forget chipotle and support your local business! I got a limeade and it was made fresh. You control the sugar. Could have had it w raspberry but didn't. So refreshing. Wish it was crushed w ice in blender and had more mint though.,Ordered delivery. Rainy so it took about 40 min. Everything is packed well so no leaks and spills. I find this place a little more expensive than I would like but the food is really good. Cheese arepas. 1 w avocado. Arepas are gluten free! They were a little tough. Maybe end of night. Or delivery kind of ruins them. But the avocado was perfectly ripe. I recommend topping w pink sauce garlic sauce or both and beans for a more complete meal. Side black beans - delish. Vegan. Pork rind arepa - everything was good in it except pork rind. It was kinda hard and tough. A little dry and bland. Again maybe end of night. Got our food around 9:45 Pm. Or we just aren't too familiar w pork rinds. I'd Order something else next time though. Artichoke arepa - delish as usualCorn - this is the best. I want like 30 of them. Perfectly cooked. So flavorful. So messy. Generous Amt of mayo and cheese. I was scraping scallions and cheese from container onto my food. It's so good but around $4-5 per corn. A portion is 1 full sized ear of corn. Generous w sauces.,Although I'm sad to see the bao place go this is a welcome addition to the hood. We tried it on the way home tonight and omg I wish I ate there (we did take out) so I could order more. We had the cheese arepa - good Artichoke arepa - amazing - the artichoke is fried and delicious and every component is seasoned perfectly Guacamole and chips - plantain chips - perfect guacamole Yuca croquettes - stuffed w cheese - crispy but soft and gooey insideI want to put that garlic sauce on everything!!!The food here is so flavorful and fresh. They think about every component of the food before the put it together The staff was lovely It's clean and spacious The prices are right and the portions are generous So many thoughtful vegetarian options - yay!!!!I will definitely be back and hope they can keep the same quality and flavor and good prices as they get busier and more popular.,La Vecina
148,This place has great sandwiches with a bang for your buckThe BOMB nothing more to sayAll the workers there get 10's very professional And experts on what theyBeen going there for 5 years n no where else I've been to can compare,Iconic place that's makes a phenomenal sandwhich. A must when in the Astoria Queens area.,"""The bomb"" - a packed sandwich thats feed 4 people for only $11.70. Everything from the bread to the pickled peppers - amazing. I'd eat this everyday. Cash only!","You see the reviews and you know the vibes. This sandwich is no joke and I eat a lot - I saved it for breakfast/lunch the next day before heading into Manhattan - which kept me stuffed for a bit.The portions for meat are astronomically filling and delicious. Fresh, cold sandwiches ready to go quickly. The service was phenomenal as well. This is how Deli's should be done!","A friendly staff greeted me and helped me navigate the menu. According to him, there are only three specials sandwiches: American, Italian, and the bomb. I know I would quickly get bored of American sandwich, so I decided to go with the bomb, which is supposedly all the good from American and Italian packed into a sandwich. The amount of meat was pretty insane - I think it took almost 3 times the space as lettuce and tomato slices. Not that I did not enjoy it though!! Pickled red peppers make the sandwich quite sour but I savored various meat from salami to roast beef. The sandwich is really huge and I was only able to eat half of it for dinner.","Listen. I live, on a good driving day, at least 25 miles away from Sal, Kris, & Charlie's. Still, I haul ass out to Astoria several times a year for one reason: The Bomb.This is the ultimate Italian-style sammich. Turkey, salami, American cheese, provolone, and seemingly a million other meats and peppers and oils that only true sandwich lovers could assemble without one flavor overriding the rest. It's reasonably priced, too, as what's seemingly five pounds of delicious hero only costs about 10 beans (from what my hazy memories recall).Someday, I'll try something else on the menu, but The Bomb calls for me whenever I step into the establishment.","Sal, Kris, & Charlie's Deli"
149,Not good table service to say the least Along with sub par food. This place is ok only if your in dire straights!!Find a better place,"Sadly I need to down grade my review. The past two times I tried to order from them I was unable to do so. The first time they kept telling me that they could not understand me that my phone was breaking up I tried calling back 4 times with the same results. OK well stuff happens, but the other place I called that night did not have an issue understanding me.Well I tried to order from them again tonight at 7PM. After verifying my address I started to place my order and was told they were out of hot and sour soup. What the hell, who runs out of soup at 7PM on a Saturday night. As that was what I really was looking forward to I told them to forget it and called the other place who was able to give me everything I wanted. Poor planning on their part has lost them a customer as I will no longer call them for delivery or pickup.",I really enjoy their food but I find it extremely odd that on an early Saturday night they no long have hot and sour soup. Very poor planning on their part and very disappointing for the customer. We will no longer be ordering or going here anymore,"This restaurant serves up good Chinese food, be it ""Americanized"", or great, in my opinion, proper Chinese food, as delineated on the menu between ""American Chinese food"" and ""Sichuan cooking"" sections. If you have a hankering for the real deal or General Tso's chicken, which is about as Chinese as a hot dog with mayo, this restaurant has got you covered.The lunch specials are a fantastic deal, given the quality and quantity of the food, with the westernized meals at the top of the lunch menu and the more ""authentic"" options towards the bottom. For $7.75 or $7.95, you get:- Fried wonton strips with duck sauce- Your entree choice- Rice, be it white, brown, or fried- Soup (Egg drop, hot and sour, wonton soup), egg roll, or sodaThe decor of the restaurant is a nice middle ground; not so run down and depressing that you're afraid a bathtub from the apartment on the floor above is going to come crashing through water-soaked ceiling tiles and kill you, nor so ensconced in imported marble tiles and trendy lighting that you wind up paying $20 for a $10 meal. It can get a bit busy for dinner so either show up early, late, or be prepared to wait. But a restaurant in NYC that is completely empty for dinner is a bad sign and probably not long for this world so...I've never ordered take out from here, so cannot comment on that; I always swing by. It's a mixture of Forest Hills / Rego Park in here; doesn't matter what background, nationality, language spoken, I've seen most of them here. I've heard English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Russian, Hindi, Spanish, and other languages spoken here. I take that as a good sign, unlike when I walk into a place in Chinatown where 95% of the people are white tourists, at which point my inner monologue starts screaming ""ABORT. ABORT."" Service is also prompt and definitely earns a high mark.In summation, I like this restaurant and recommend it if you're in the area. Unless you have a primal craving for General Tso's chicken or something, order something that is explicitly labeled as spicy and enjoy yourself. You shouldn't be disappointed.","Grand Sichuan II is a mainstay in these parts.  They do a few things well, which if you stick to, you should enjoy the food well.The Moo Shu dishes whether pork, chicken or veggie are all great.  A sautéed cabbage, bamboo shoot and wood ear mushroom base is seasoned well for all versions.  Three thin flour pancakes are standard with each Moo Shu order with options to add additional pancakes if needed.  Often times three is not enough but rice is included with the order to finish off any remaining  Moo Shu.One of the best dishes here is the Guangzhou Chicken.  which are tender nibbles of fried chicken that can be really spicy.  It's best to try this dish in house as take out can make the chicken pieces soggy but the flavor doesn't  suffer regardless.  It is cooked with generous red pepper and scallion and tender bamboo shoots.  The combination of the red pepper and scallion greatly added to the flavor of the dish.Sautéed string beans are generally a good veggie dish.  More often than not the beans are lightly sautéed and crisp.  There have a been a few instances where the string beans have aged but generally speaking, this was been few and far in between.The Spicy Wontons appetizer are similarly a must for any order, a spicy, meaty, nutty and great flavor.  So there you have it, if you stay with these favorites, I'm sure they will be yours as well.",Not good table service to say the least Along with sub par food.

150,"We ordered dinner from here for delivery via Seamless and while the food we actually received was delicious, they forgot to give us half of our order. When we called and told them about the issue, they said the best they could do was refund us for the food we didn't get and they were unable to get us what we were missing. While it was appreciated that we were compensated, it didn't nearly solve the issue of a customer missing half of their dinner. Again, I will say what we ordered was delicious and I would probably go back to the restaurant for food, but I don't trust them enough to order delivery again especially since they didn't resolve the issue.","Food was decent but the wait staff could use a refresh.   First indicator, had to ask for the food menu after flagging the waiter down after he took someone else's order (who they also had to flag down).  Mind you, this is dinner at 5:30 so the restaurant is empty.Second issue: I was in the bathroom and someone walked in on me by pushing through a locked door!.  granted those doors are strange, but after the  3rd attempt, someone (turned out to be the waiter) barged in on me.  After a few minutes where I had to calm myself down , I was on my way out and saw the door was indeed locked!  Apparently if you push hard enough, the door opens!It's one thing to have shit doors; ok I will chalk it up as an accident.  But the waiter (offender) had the nerve to tell me that I should lock the door.  I told him that if the door doesn't open the first few times, then it's probably occupied and doesn't need to use brute force to open it. Tip to management: fix your bathroom locks. ! And hire waiters with better socials skills that don't blame customers for their errors",I was there awhile ago just never wrote the review...Excellent food and vibesGreat place for a date,"Yes, guilty.  Took years to finally write this well earned review.  Lived in Astoria when they opened.  Attended a Yelp event soon after.  Dined here countless number of time thereafter.  See for yourself why it's in the Michelin guide 2019.Service is impeccable, including the owner checking on patrons, especially on peak dinner service nights.  I am South Asian by descent, therefore, I can keenly aware of my own personal high standards when it comes to this cuisine.That being said, from start to finish, the meal is always sublime.  Whatever you see in my pictures, order it.  You cannot go wrong.  Key observation to be noted, they use a lot of heavy cream in all their curries.  I happen to witness this while waiting by their open kitchen.  Reason I mention this, actual real curries are not made with cream, at all.It is a very modern, western spin on Indian cuisine.  However, I would have to concede, it is not authentic (if that's what you're seeking).Peace.",Came here with my friend for Chicken Tikka Masala. We got both rice and nan. Not only is this place beyond beautiful but the service is actually really good too. There's a full bar and a wide variety of wines. Highly recommended for groups. Please keep the thought of limited parking in mind. Average Pricing. 4 Stars because I felt like the dish could have had more flavor to it but was tasty.,"Overall I was very disappointed by my experience having dinner at Kurry Qulture last night. Despite the place not being even halfway full, we had to wait 30 minutes past our 9 pm reservation before getting seated. When we asked how long it would be, the waiter snapped at us rudely and told us to just wait because we would be waiting at the table if he seated us anyway so what's the difference ? Not sure how that makes sense. After we were finally seated we were only given the drink menu and we were abandoned for another ten minutes. When we asked for a food menu, we were snapped at rudely again to the point that the whole table went silent from shock for a moment. Finally, the appetizers came. We were all so hungry at this point because it was about an hour after we arrived. The food was good but the portions were so tiny ! We were hoping and praying for better with dinner but again we were disappointed. The chicken biryani was ridiculous. It was enough to feed one person and it was basically just rice and chicken. No flavor at all! The other dishes were alright - nothing great and nothing horrible. The portions were again tiny and completely overpriced.The decor was lovely and the drinks were good but the food was not worth the price and it was definitely not worth the poor level of customer service. I would not return here.",Kurry Qulture
151,"Totally disappointed with my delivery. Lomo saltado, steak was dry and over cooked fries gross and a piece of egg white soaked in oil! Mofongo with extra sauce, we got 2 different sauces and it was oily. Maybe good for eating in but take out sux!!","I ordered food from this place and took them over 90 minutes to deliver. I contacted the restaurant for a ETA for the delivery. They handed the phone to the manager and manager stated that it would be there in 5 minutes. I waited for 15 minutes and the food did not arrive. So I called back and the manager picked up. The manager had a disgusting attitude. Manager was sarcastic, nasty, and claimed that I was being rude and was yelling at him. He even yelled at me. I was just questioning about the whereabouts of my delivery. In addition, because I ordered the food through Yelp, he suggested that  he can cancel the order, but would be unable to refund me the money. How does a business suggest something like that? How does one run a business with such poor attitude?When the food arrived, it was cold. Portions were small considering the quantity that was given and what was charged. The food was mediocre and expensive for the portions give . I've had better empanadas, maduros, and guacamole at other places and charged at a reasonable price. The only good thing was their hot sauce. I would not recommend this place at all. Nowadays, businesses rely on customer service. This place provided me mediocre service with a nasty attitude. I would never step foot to this restaurant or order from this place again and advise others not to. There are better Latin food elsewhere.","Awesome dishes, their tamal with shrimp is to die for. The skirt steak is also delicious and don't forget to have a coconut mojito. Service is slow in busy days that's why it's a 4 rating. But the food is 5 stars. The vegetarian dishes are also very tasty!","Mister suggested Matiz last night to celebrate our meeting each other 11 years ago and of course I said yes. We love Matiz, the atmosphere, food, drinks and service are all wonderful!  I've been ordering fish for dinner this past month and tried Pescado Veracruzano before, so I chose Salmon Tropical last night and it was DIVINE. The fish was tender and flavorful especially when mixed with the accompanying red quinoa and vegetables.  I sipped on Kettleone vodka with seltzer and lime as I scarfed down my entrée while Mister had Jungle Booze (his favorite) and Sopa Alta Mar for dinner.  I polished off a Tres Leches with White Chocolate dessert (SO GOOD) and we went off into the night, sated, buzzed and very happy. We'll be back soon!","Mister suggested Matiz last night to celebrate our meeting each other 11 years ago and of course I said yes.

152,I've been frequenting this location for about 10 years the owners have always changed but the food has always been good but for the first time the service has been very poor and I still can't believe The waiter through the plate on the table and walked away as if I owed them something still in disbelief this will be the last time I ever give business to this location.Don't go to this location!!,"Quality has definitely gone down,  a spicy tuna roll should not be filled with grease! They are using more fillers than actual tuna, cutting corners.",umi sushi has lunch and dinner boxes that are my go to. They arent expensive and very filling. I usually get it delivered to st.Johns during along day of studying.,"What a lovely find!  My friends wanted to go out for sushi and discovered this place in Queens. It's not in an area I would usually go to but this place was a great find. It has a bit of a Korean feel, small but big enough to be kid friendly, and the service and vibe is spectacular. Our waiter, Be, was welcoming from the beginning and gave A+ service. He gave my daughter who is only 1 got a bowl of miso soup with a couple of ice cubes so that it wasn't too hot. How thoughtful! She had her own plate as well.  We ordered the Showboat which was around $65 and had what you normally would expect - a lot of sashimi, California roll, some sushi, wasabi, and ginger.  I think the price was pretty standard as well as the quality of the meats.  What stood out for me was indeed the service. The waiters aren't on top of you but they are always aware if you need a plate removed, replaced, or a tea refill.  At first, he complimented us with a shrimp appetizer. Then in the middle of our meal, he brought a sweet potato and mango roll complimentary.  Then when we were paying our bill, he came over and said he would like to give us ice cream on the house - vanilla, red bean, or green tea.  WHAT?!?  Not only is the restaurant generous, but they are seriously one of the most customer-oriented places in New York City and every customer gets treated like royalty.  I would return and I LOVE that they like kids!  Highly recommend....","We've been to Umi Sushi a few times over the years, and have puzzled over the restaurant's high Yelp ratings. Then and now Umi Sushi seems incredibly popular, filled with families, college students, even sexily-dressed couples. Those who arrive a little late for lunch or dinner may have to wait for seating.Food / Value: OK (3 of 5). The food here is generally of average execution, and commensurately value-priced.Dishes We've Had:- Ika Tempura: I thought that these would be fried squid tempura rather than common fried calamari rings.- Shrimp Tempura Roll: Meh; only slightly crisp.- Honey River Roll: Like a shrimp tempura roll combined with an eel roll. Pretty good flavors, but the shrimp tempura had only a hint of crispness.- Salmon Teriyaki Lunch / Dinner Box: Umi does a very good salmon teriyaki. - Bulgogi (Yakiniku) Lunch Box, Sweet Potato Tempura Roll (complementary): Both were OK.- Sashimi Roll: The fish wasn't the freshest, and lacked some firmness, but the roll was serviceable.Service: Very Good (4 of 5). The staff is polite, friendly, and efficient. Tea refills were automatic. Umi Sushi does not provide tip suggestions.","Medium sized restaurant right near the busy intersections of Union Tpke and Utopia Pkwy, definitely convenient for any St John's students (I think you get a 10% off discount with SJU ID as well). Super busy on a Sunday night surprisingly. Service was attentive even when it was super busy. Tempura appetizer was super crispy, just the way I like it. The spider roll batter was not what I'm normally used to so was a little bit too breaded for me. Avocado salmon roll was good as well. They gave out complimentary miso soup and 2 pieces of sweet potato mango roll. Not too horrible to find street parking in front either.",Umi Sushi
153,The Brussels sprout pizza is unexpectedly AMAZING...as is the CLAM PIZZA???You ought to go.,"we were told there would be a 20 minute wait, which we were ok with, and they suggested we go get a drink next door at the diamond dog, which, again, we were happy to do. 40 minutes go by, and there is no word from the restaurant, so we decide to go in and see what's up. we are told that they are waiting for a party to leave, and it should be another 10 minutes. ok, no problem. 10 minutes go by. i ask the the hostess if the party that is waiting to leave has gotten their bill. She says no, because she doesn't know whether they'll be having dessert. So I ask, have they been asked whether they would like dessert. No, she doesn't believe so. We left. We were a party of 6 clearly ethnic people in a place full of white people. They could have just told us we weren't wanted but making us wait was more cruel, and therefore more up their alley.","Entrees were served 10 minutes apart. By the time we could start, the first entree was cold. The waiter said this is normal at Milkflower since they have two separate kitchens.The pizza was extremely soggy, and very doughy, way beyond what a Napolitan style should be.I asked the waiter about this, and he brushed me off and said to simply order ""well done"" next time. There won't be a next time. Entrees for two people should be served at the same time, and a pizza shouldn't have to be ordered ""well done"". Very disappointing. Considering the steep prices here... you're MUCH better off going to one of the other hundred options in Astoria.","One of the first restaurants we tried upon moving to Astoria and is still quite possibly my favorite meal I've had in Astoria. Everything from the incredible service to the beyond delicious food makes this an A+ establishment. The pizza is the centerpiece, but do not skip over the other parts of this menu. The wood-roasted broccoli rabe was so fresh and perfectly cooked. The ricotta appetizer was delicious as well. Now - the pizzas...I would feel comfortable saying that all of them are probably amazing and I plan to return and return until I can confirm such.","Stopped in here on a whim and I wasn't disappointed!  The ambiance is very comfortable, my waiter was extremely nice and despite a very busy restaurant, took the time of his own accord to explain the menu to me, and the hostess went above and beyond to find me an outlet to plug in my poor dying phone!  I had the Karlsruhe and it was perfect.  Who knew corn on pizza could be that good.In any case, this place gets two thumbs up from me!","While NYC has plenty of New York style pizza places slapping you in the face at every corner; Milkflower is a nice break from the conventional pizza game in the area with their authentic Italian style pizzas. My friend and I came here for dinner while venturing around Astoria and we loved it from the moment we walked in and were seated. They have a cute little backyard area in with a rustic and homey feel that we sat in, complete with wooden benches.As for the food, The ""Abe Foreman"" was absolutely delicious. The tomato, garlic, charred onion, pork sausage, and grana padano made for an amazing flavor profile. I added spicy soppressata which really set everything off for me.  The pizza paired perfectly with the glass of white wine I ordered. All in all, Milk flower is simply lovely. I have my eyes on a couple of their other pizzas as well as an order of their grilled octopus when I'm back in Queens.",Milkflower
154,"Quick bite before Moving Image Museum. Amazing-ness! Had the Pork arepa with black beans, and plantains. Phenomenal! Done and out in 20 mins. $8 had me totally full.","Absolute worst FOOD POISONING of my life!I went in for dinner and the restaurant was freezing. Something must have been wrong with their heating system. Like the other customers, I decided to just keep my jacket on. I ordered a couple arepas, one beef with cheese and one shrimp. Came out a little cold. Ate them anyway since I was starving.The next morning, I started violently vomiting. It was like something out of a horror movie. The projectile vomit was soon accompanied by cramps, chills, diarrhea, and a fever. I spent the whole weekend bedridden sipping on fluids to keep from dying.My theory is that due to the restaurant being so cold, they couldn't keep their food at the appropriate temperature. This became breeding ground for bacteria.What sucks is that I've been here a couple times before and enjoyed their food; but now I can't trust it. A safety inspector definitely needs to come in and check this place out. It literally is a bio hazard and unsafe for the public.",Great food ! taste amazing ! but service was kinda slow even though when me & my bf came it wasnt busy at all :(,"Being raised in a household where dinner was chicken, chicken, and more chicken...I had never had an Arepa.  Thankfully I found the Arepas Cafe - it's delicious!  The arepas are all really tasty, the flavor combinations are great and they are filling.  Get one and an appetizer if you want to be full and two if you want to be stuffed.  I really like the Mami and the corn fritter app.  Finishing off with the tres leches cake is never a bad idea.  Love coming here and it's on my list of favorite places to visit!","Found this great Venezuelan restaurant on Yelp. We started with the mini platter which was pretty good, particularly the cachapas (corn pancakes with cheese on top)! The arepas were super filling, especially after the appetizers. My favorite one was the Pabellon Pernil (pork with avocado). I also liked the Pabellon de pollo which my wife got.You've got to try the Chicha drink, which was similar to a horchata, except more thick. We got 1 to start off with, but ended up getting 2 more to go!","To be very honest the experience was pretty bad. Thank goodness to the waitress I saw at the very end who made my experience pleasant. Took forever to get someone, they forgot my drink, among other things and never checked in. Now the food- best I had all trip. Delicious! Loved the pabellón de pollo. I wished I had found this place sooner and maybe had it to go.",Arepas Cafe
155,The food is good but it's really expensive.  Also I paid $1.00 for this amount of guacamole in picture.,"I, first want to begin with a positive note - their food is definitely AUTHENTIC , EXCEPTIONAL - DELICIOUS !! AND AND the only good Mexican food restaurant in the area - I give them FIVE STARS hands up when it comes to the FOOD!! BUT, the management and the owners are the worst - they cheat,  lie and still - let me tell you why..One Sunday afternoon my friends and family decided to eat at this place - we were celebrating a bautismos - we were a party  of 8 !!!!We ate, we drank , we were having a great time - until they presented us with the bill !!! It turns out they were automatically charging us a $60 "" room party"" charge - this  charge did not include the alcohol nor tip. $60 dollars is not a big deal for a party of 8 ($7.50 per person extra) What's very upsetting is - from the moment we walked in and asked for a table of 8 - no one - not one single person mention anything about a"" party room"" charge ..This is what is most  upsetting - they lie !! They are not honest people.. When we questions such charge - the owner Adriana gave us attitude and told us to pay what ever  we wanted with an ATTITUDE .. very unprofessional ! They made me feel like they did not value me, my friends , my family nor my business... Guess what we did - we paid what they asked for  + alcohol + tip ...But guess what - NEVER !!! Never will I ever visit , nor invite , nor recommend Kermes - I am sorry but what they did was wrong !!!I value honesty and how they made US feel - and they really suck at this ..The owners should really leave the management part to someone that knows about customer service The owner don't care about the people they only care about the money !!!","I never review restaurants but am shocked at the treatment I just received. Called ahead to ask if there was room on the patio and was told there was plenty. Drove there and entered with my family late afternoon and was told no outdoor seating available for an hour. Asked why, was told first come first served. Went back to see for myself and there were 3 empty tables. Suddenly they are all reserved. ""I thought it was first come first served?"" I asked. No answer. Felt unwanted from the moment we walked in the door.","Just had a late lunch here. The food was fantastic! We had an order of Mexican corn, Campechana quesadilla, a fish, carne asada taco, and fried sweet plantains. This was probably one of the best quesadilla's I've ever had and the same goes with the plantains. The tacos were great and everything was really really good. We finished with an order of churros and dulce de leche cream. I highly recommend giving this place a try. You won't be disappointed!","Support your local artisinal tacqueria!  So glad this place exists!  I've tried many in the area and been sorely disappointed, however, this place is ALL THAT and a bag of chips (with guacamole)!Ate our food outside as it wasn't too hot.  I regretted that bc mosquito's had at me. And there are the local kitty cats who beg for you to drop food (which i did, sorrynotsorry!).  Made a joke to my boyfriend calling the kitten ""TACO CAT"" to which he astutely pointed out that it was an anagram (go ahead, read it backwards! It's still:  Taco Cat)!Boyfriend had a beer, I had a frozen strawberry margarita (no salt).  My margarita was so yummy, I had another. (later we cue in the hiccups from being slightly tipsy).  They brought water at our request.Service was friendly, prompt and thoughtful; extra napkins didn't even have to ask- that's kinda a big deal.To start we nibbled on their guacamole and chips as well as a the Street Corn, Cotija and Chile Powder which is my boyfriends favorite appetizer when available - he LOVED it.  I am a big fan of guac done right - sometimes that can be my meal.  It actually takes some skill to mash cilantro, lime, onions into avocado. Simple ingredients, yet not every place nails it: Sabor!  Once I taste the guacamole and it's this good - I know I am coming back if for nothing else but this appetizer.Note to self:  I have to remember to ask for 'no jalapeno's' next time as that is the default.  Thought I could handle it, but I could not.  Hey, gotta try everything once, no?We ordered a side of mexican rice and refried beans.  Perfect accompaniment to my Burrito (includes Mexican rice, refried pinto beans, guacamole, pico de Gallo, Kermes cheese blend and sour cream) and boyfriends Taco Trio (Steak, Chicken and Al Pastor).  He said his tacos (which arrived beautifully presented) was amazing.  I stole a bite of his steak taco. He then said he was going to complain there was a bite missing from his taco just because it was so good, he wanted more. lol.I was so full from all of the food we ordered and ate, I never made it to dessert.  Shame.  No worries:  Got my eye on some churros for my next visit. My take away:  this is the best mexican in Queens.  Enjoyed every bite and left happy, full, satisfied.  Our meal came to about $91 bucks not incl tip.  I don't think that's bad considering we had three alcoholic beverages, two appetizers and two main courses and one side.Pleasant and clean atmosphere.  Everything arrived in the proper order.  That's key.  Ate at a mexican place in Roslyn a week ago (that I normally frequent) and they brought EVERYTHING out at once.  We complained but nothing was done.  That, is a horrible dining experience and a total travesty.  I felt like they didn't care that they plopped my apps, salad and main courses all at once on me.  Who does that?  Why did you do that and then not care when I complained?  So needless to say, Tacqueria Kermes did not do this.  I hope they continue on with the good service and delicious food.  I'll come here instead.Had to give it 5 stars because there is a ton of competition and this place stands out.  You can dine inside, it is small -but not tiny.  I think I spied about 15 tables, plus you can sit at the bar.  You can dine on their patio and enjoy Taco Cat and friends.  Wherever in the restaurant you sit, you will enjoy delicious authentic mexican cuisine done beautifully!  It raises the bar for Fresh Pond Road!","Had a great meal. Showed up at 12pm on a Sat and was told they were not open. When I asked the kid behind the door again he checked in the back,  and suddenly they were open. Yelp hours say they open at 11am. So, yeah, if you are making a trip be sure to check.Now the good stuff...The tacos were great and the prices were good, too.Chips and guacamole were also done right. The drinks are even better. I had the best watermelon mojito EVER.The churros were also perfectly crispy but also chewy and had a delicious cream filling that was not overbearing.If you are hungry and want some good tacos and delicious drinks I recommend them.",Taqueria Kermes
156,"Not impressed by the lobster!  It is frozen, not fresh, you can tell.  They tried to disguise the frozen taste by giving the lobster a black pepper bath.  Yuck!  And the seaweed salad ugh.  Thanks for the small piece of imitation crab meat. The only thing that is good is the clam chowder that probably came out of can and loaded it with clams.","For a lobster roll in flushing, this place is pretty impressing. This place is like a booth in a mini mall. I was expecting the lobster rolls to be not so fresh. Surprisingly, I was wrong. Only one worker was working on a Wednesday night. He was young but very hard working. Unfortunately the clam chowder was out of stock at 7pm. We opted for a lobster roll on a French baguette. Pros - you can choose how much mayo you want on it in case you want to be healthier. It also came with a Kani and seaweed salad on the side. They served the lobster roll with gloves. overall it was mediocre. Too much bread, not enough lobster- albeit the lobster was fresh.",Food is too salty. To much salt and pepper for something that's request for lit mayo and other stuff,Delicious! Quick trip to NY and stayed near by. As always I usually walk around to find something that looks good and this place didn't disappoint. I giggled when the roll came out with plastic gloves. But after eating it I appreciated that my hands didn't get dirty and didn't smell like seafood. Will be back if I'm ever nearby again!,"THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!!!  The woman behind the counter told me that they lobsters were frozen when I asked. Sales people really do care about the quality and the honesty that serve to customers.  Yuck!  The artificial crab meat on my seaweed salad!  This is the place to go for indigestion.Really, you are trying to sell and praise your sucky establishment.  You're just a worker trying to defend your job so you can keep it.",Fast service!  This is the second time I ordered clam chowder from them.  Yummy!!!,Lobster Roll Factory
157,"Having lunch here on a nice weather,u can sit outside,there a big TV,the food portion is big.",Came there about a month ago with my wife and a buddy.. place was empty which sometimes is a bad sign but not in the case.. food was excellent.. the pretzel appetizer was awesome.. all three of our entrees were very good.. great service even the busboy i think his name was mike couldnt have been a nicer kid.. we will 100% be back,Cool German spot good beer and food I'm not too much of a dessert guy but their strudel was very dry but place and service made it up for it give it a try,"Great vibe, food, and beer! I tried both inside and outside... but if you come on a nice day, i would recommend sitting outside :)The giant pretzel is excellent! Warm crust with chewy center... with mustards and spiced cheese! Try it... you won't regret it!Wurst sampler is sooo delicious!!!I will come back empty stomach to try more food. Wis sehen uns!","Great vibe, food and beer!!!The restaurant was clean, comfortable and cozy. The servers were very friendly! We had some appetizers and desserts, everything were perfect. Big dishes, fair rates.  Would surely recommend trying this place!@docsabrina",Decent ethnic German food. Nice place where parking that can be an issue sometimes.The place is fun and the waitresses dress up to give the feeling that you are really in an Octoberfest.,Jägerhaus German Restaurants and Biergarten
158,"As you can see from my photos, I am a regular here. I love that they are able to sustain their tasty broth and their quality of the ingredients, every visit, it is the taste that I remember. My go-to dishes are:- Spicy Pho- Brisket Pho- Summer Roll- Pork Chop AppetizerThe restaurant is located next to Auburndale Papa John's. It's a small plaza on Northern. It does have a small parking lot, but it's usually all full because there is an auto-shop next door. In all the visits to Pho Che, they are full-house throughout the dinner time rush. However, the wait times has never been too long, so I'll give 5 stars for efficiency of the restaurant for that. You expect it as a norm, but it's quite difficult to manage.They started serving boba teas as well, but I haven't gotten a chance to try it yet. I get a little skeptical over boba tea... but I will give it a try one day!","Worst vermicelli bun I've ever had. Ive never left a vietnamese place angry before lol... it wasnt at all what Bun should be like. Hot noodles, salad covered in mayo, no other vegetables, just chicken on a bed of hot mushy noodles for $11. I'm sure their banh mi and pho are good though.",Best pho in NY I've had so far (coming from a Vietnamese Update: fried rice is bomb,"First off, I'm finally reviewing this place after coming here a few times. 3.5 stars. Friendly staff and quick service. Inside is warm and welcoming, mostly locals from the neighborhood. I came upon this place after my sister was raving about it, she worked a few store fronts down in the neighboring plaza. It became a routine lunch spot for her for quick, cheap, tasty eats.We came in on a Sunday evening, approximately 30 mins wait time that turned into 45 roughly. Not a bad sign, the more packed a place is the better the food would be. Owners wife knows my sister personally as a reoccurring customer, and came to greet us while we were waiting. She took our order so there'd be a shorter wait. (Unfortunately messed up one order, but complimentary Thai iced teas on the house!)After reading the reviews for the most popular items, I decided to try the French fries Provençal. Pro, they were hot and crispy, con they were obnoxiously garlicky. They sufficed as we waited for our bowls of Pho. I got the spicy broth with shrimp, and my sister got the brisket pho. Omg. The spicy broth is to die for. Its the perfect balance of spicy and savory. The pho is brought out in a massive steaming bowl. (First thought is wow, this is huge I can't finish it, but once you get started it's gone.) Its warm and filling, the rice noodles are soft and the broth practically sticks to it. There are also scallions, onions, bean sprouts, jalapeños and a few other things topping you can add to make it your own. It's the kind of broth that makes your nose runny but you can't stop eating! And as for my sister, she's literally orders the same Brisket Pho everytime, so I'm assuming it's good. Total bill, $36. not bad for a dinner for 2 Definitely returning but before the dinner rush.","Amazing pho! Comes out piping hot - just like I like it! Even the plain pho was delicious! Perfect for a chilly night. I ordered a passion fruit with boba, however, the boba was hard. So that was a little disappointing.","I am VERY impressed with the pho at this restaurant. First time, I ordered a bowl with rare steak, and I almost cried, partially from joy, partially because the jalapeños are SPICY! The broth is just how I like it, hot, flavorful, not greasy. I can be quite picky when it comes to pho, and this pho is deserving of five stars.Today, I came back for another bowl. This time, I got the rare steak/brisket, which was a great call. The brisket is lean and delicious, a perfect complement to the rare steak. I asked for extra cilantro and jalapeños, and the waitress quickly procured a dish for me. At the end, I lifted the bowl to my lips, gulping until there was nothing left.If you like southern Vietnamese pho, this is a terrific place to get it. (I was not as impressed by the pork banh mi, but that's not really my scene anyway.) Your glass of water probably isn't going to get refilled, so get a bubble tea or a pitcher of Sapporo or something. Bathroom is in the back.",Pho Che
159,"Whoever says for this place is not good that person is very wrong .Food is amazing, tasty, fancy a lot of gluten free options.drinks are very different thna any other place .""-Service is also very good!!!they just open and they need little more time to settle.",The food at Ninos is very good and creative. The problem here is the bar. The cocktails take forever to arrive and when they do they are quite weak. I had to buy a second shot to taste the alcohol in my cocktail. I overheard the next table making the same complaint and the waitress' response was to say the customer would have to order a double. The second shot I bought also arrived slowly and when it came it was not even an ounce.  So my $13 cocktail becomes $26 and simply was not worth it.,"If I could give 0 star I would!! Went in today, it wasn't so busy. Manager slapped menus on our table. Waited forever to order. Our water never came. Coffee never came. The most horrible thing? Dirty ass silverware! Are you kidding me? This is the base line of being in the restaurant industry.","5 starts for sure!I been tonight with my friend, we had such amazing dinner , food was very delicious, big portions, very tasty and perfect serving. our waiter Bojan was very kind and wonderful to us!I definitely do recommend this place , and can't wait to be back!The best restaurant in Astoria!","I don't go out for Italian too often because I am lucky to know excellent home cooks that feed me real deal Italian home cooking, and my working class roots make classic red sauce pizzerias/restaurants take care of the crave. Ninos AQ piqued my interest with the unique ingredients described on the menu and quirky choices like ""Mexican Street Corn"" that you wouldn't find in everyday Italian places. Perhaps its better to describe this as New American by way of Italy.Service was good and our dishes came out family style in the order we requested. Here's my take on the food:Crispy Burrata for 2: 1st thought was $18 for a large cheese ball, this better be something special. It wasn't. Disappointing since the inside was more like thick ricotta encased in mozzarella. I've had this similar dish elsewhere where the creamy burrata mixes with the sauce making you want to lick the bowl clean - not here unfortunately.Truffled Prosciutto Pizza: Had a nice ""truffle"" smell when it came out, but I didn't get any flavor. I also thought the cooked prosciutto pieces were too large making for salty bites. Creamy ricotta, decent dough saved by the pizza rule even when its bad it's still pretty good.Gnocchi Cacio E Pepe: Interesting idea, but terrible execution. Easily the worst thing I ate here - gummy gnocchi; watery stringy sauce; no cheese or pepper flavor. Bland tasting like mushy gruel. Pass on this. ($21 for this! Got 12 Gnocchi. $1.75 per gnocchi hahaha)Nicky Santoro's Veal Parm for 2: Certainly an impressive looking bone in veal chop platter (Hello Instagram!). If they did a chicken parm with the same prep you probably couldn't tell the difference - seems like a waste of a veal chop (Check out Positano in Williston Park on LI that simply grills their quality chops to know the difference). The acid of the tomato and maybe a hit of lemon was way high for me.Orange Glazed Short Ribs: Best dish of the night, but inconsistently cooked. The first pieces I tried were fall apart tender and good flavor, but the next piece I had was a bit over cooked and dry. I liked the pattypan squash and celery root puree.We passed on dessert, and called it an early night. Saw many people dining outside and enjoying cocktails - you may want to do this instead of a full meal. I had a quality, well made Negroni.Special shout out to my friends for celebrating my birthday with me here - I wish the dinner was knock it out of the park like you all are always!","Had been looking to come here for a bit and finally had the chance to go.  First, I will say I was very impressed with the food.  Everything was delicious.  The portion size was adequate for what we were being charged.  My daughter had the Nutella pizza which she had zero complaints about.  I tried it.  It was delicious.  You cannot go wrong with Nutella....ever.  The hubs had the Everything Bagel Pizza, which to his delight had a hefty portion of lox.   It was quite delicious.  I had the Chilaquiles.   Very tasty.  Delicious. What you would expect from your standard Chilaquiles.  Secondly, the drinks.  I had the most amazing drink.  The AQ Spritz, which consisted of Tito's (my fave), Prosecco and Grapefruit Syrup.  I could easily knock back a few of these but the price prevented me from doing so.  Especially since the glass was less than 3/4 filled.  My husband got a Moscow Mule, which was good but not served in the standard copper cup, which admittedly took away from the drink.  I'm a traditionalist.   What can I say?  My daughter had a coke.  What was disappointing was...there was none.  She had to wait for someone to go to the store and buy it.  Not sure if there was an issue with the tap/fountain/draft/what ever it is called but we weren't offered an explanation, an apology, etc.  I understand things happen.   No biggie but it's a bit odd to have to wait for a soda.My husband decided to have a beer.  He asked for a Peroni.  After some time our server returned to say there was none.  He was offered something comparable to which he agreed upon.  After waiting and waiting and waiting, it never came.   It wasn't busy as we had made reservations first thing so we'd understand if it were the height of service but the bar was so slow.  There were two people behind it and I hate to say it but they moved like turtles.  I sat directly across from the bar and watched and waited as the drinks were literally being made at a snails pace.  We were done with our meal and my husband asked the waiter where the drink was.  Noticing we were done and waiting only on the drink he informed us that the bar had not yet prepared it.  We cancelled the beer.  Not sure how much prep goes into a beer but bar service, or beverage service, is what completely brought my 5 star rating down to a 4.  The waiting.  The lack of explanation was a bit disheartening.   The food; however was amazing and totally worth coming back for.In conclusion, the food?  DELICIOUS!  Just step up the beverage section.  I want to come back and drink appropriately filled glasses of that AQ Spritz.  My husband wants a Peroni or something comparable in a timely manner and my daughter wants a coke without having to wait after her parents have been served bar drinks.  Oh, and get the proper Copper mule cups!  It truly does add to the Mule experience.",Ninos Aq
160,First time here. Cashier lady is too busy on her phone to realize I'm there. I didn't want to assume anything and patiently waited. She needs a bell to get her attention. Please get her one.,"I hate to drop my ratings on these guys since I still like their food. But they have been raising their prices consistently to the point that its not really affordable anymore.Expect to pay close to 10 dollars for their cheapest plate which is a half chicken and rice. The ribs are more than 10 and the combo is 15 bucks. It still tastes good, its just getting a bit expensive to eat here.","The owner/manager is a b*tch *ss p**ce of sh*t for 1) not allowing orders to be phoned in and 2) not accepting debit/credit and for that I take one star off, otherwise the food is very good.","It's worth the wait. After a lot of hype, got to try the chicken and spareribs from Peking BBQ. As accompaniments, fried rice, plaintains (yes!), salad (personal ew), beans, and green sauce (lots and lots of green sauce). The line can be quite daunting at times, I would recommend asking for a predicted wait time and returning 10min before then to pick up your food. There is a card shop next door for quick browsing needs. The spareribs are the go-to and the chicken holds its own against some of the best in the neighborhood. Enjoy!","A group of friends and I had to change our plans and ended up here. The food was phuking amazing. I got the shrimp fried rice while my friends got the shrimp and broccoli, chicken friend rice, beef and broccoli and half chicken with rice. Everything tasted great and we got our food in no time. The restaurant had a decent sized sitting area but isn't ideal for large groups.","Food: 4.5/5Came here with a friend for the first time. It's like a fast food/seat yourself type of establishment. They're well known for their chicken, fried rice and soup. There's a sign outside that says ""best chicken in town"" so I was pretty pumped.The food is pretty darn delicious. For $10, you can get half a chicken, fried rice and a side salad. I usually get a quarter chicken but I got greedy. The chicken is rotisserie style and might be one of the best rotisserie chickens I've ever tried. The fried rice was slightly too greasy but it was good. There was nothing special about the salad.The soup was pretty delicious as well. I know where I'm going next time I'm sick and in need of chicken soup.Service: 3/5You seat yourself so there's basically no seating. The guys behind the counter are pretty friendly though.Ambiance: 1/5Haha this place is pretty gross. Nothing special. Good for a quick bite or with friends. Not a date spot unless your date really loves food.",Peking BBQ
161,This place is very expensive for this price nothing worth to eat The owner is getting nice but you have to pay for he's smile not the food Please don't eat here not worth t,This is worst place to eat The food are not good and clean Salads don't wash  did bug  on leave The price very expensive not worth Try the balkh kabab on 31 street and 23 Ave,"I was hugely disappointed with the food. I ordered the eggplant dish & did not like it. It was very different from I have in other Afghan restaurant. I found it to be very bland. Also got the lentil soup which was probably the best thing we ordered. We tried the dumpling (vegetarian) appetizer and some of the dumplings was still somewhat semi frozen & cold which made us think it wasn't cooked properly, unless it's supposed to be cold like that??? It wasn't good. The restaurant itself is very pleasant. No problems with the service. Nicest bathroom I've ever seen!","The owner of this place is super sweet !! He seems like he really loves his business which is the perfect type of owner because he makes sure all the customers are taken care of and are enjoying the food. The rest room was very clean and actually the prettiest bathroom decor i have ever seen. The food was also amazing !! Substituted the rice for kabuli which was carrots and raisins on top, delicious. I also got chicken breast kabobs on the side which was juicy and tender. The owner was nice enough to give us a complimentary hummus, i usually do not like hummus but it was actually amazinggg !! I also recommend getting the firni for dessert you will not regret it ! It's a sweet afghan pudding made to perfection by the chefs. The only con I would say was that he charges for water since he gives water bottles and not tap water. I feel that every restaurant should have free water for their customers. Otherwise this is a small but comfortable warm setting with delicious food and great service. I highly recommend and would definitely return here soon !!","I haven't been back to Sami's in about a year, and it was time for a return visit!  On this Friday night @6pm, my party of 8 had no problem getting a table.  Sadly, Sami (& his family) were not there; It would have been nice to see everyone again!Our shared meal tonight (shared by 4 ppl):- Hummus- Burani Badenjan (eggplant)- Afghan Salad- Afghan Bread- Family Kebab Platter (lamb chops, Afghan chicken kebabs, Beef Tikka Kebab and Lamb Shank...all on a bed of Qabli Rice w.carrots & raisins- Tap water-yes, they do serve tap water if you ask lol (inside joke).To be honest, the appetizers weren't as flavorful as I remember them being in my past visits. Also, the Afghan bread didn't seem as fresh either.  But, all still very enjoyable. The kebabs, however, were all pretty darn good!  My least fave was the beef tikka kebab, which I thought were nowhere as tender as the other kebabs.  My fave, as usual, were the lamb chops.  I usually like my chops med-rare.  Although these chops were well-done, somehow, they remained tender and very flavorful. Surprisingly, my second fave dish were the Afghan chicken thighs; again, so tender and flavorful!  What's their secret?!?!  I want to know! lol The lamb shank was pretty good also; the meat just fell off the bone. All in all, a pretty satisfying and tasty meal!Service and hospitality were great but we all definitely missed that personal touch that Sami has always provided in the past.  I'm planning a return visit in a few weeks, and hopefully, Sami will be there!  But Sami apparently has been busy opening up another location nearby!  Good luck and best wishes!  We missed you (and Abdul)!!",I returned to Sami's with another entourage of 12 and we all had a wonderful time!  Same fantastic food;  same fantastic hospitality!!  Sami's is consistently GREAT!  Looking forward to many return visits!  :),Sami's Kabab House
162,"Do not order from here.  They never get the order right, it takes forever, it's over priced and mediocre.  When I called to discuss an incorrect order, I was told I had to call delivery.com and dispute it myself.   Absurd.  When I complained, they gave me a partial refund, did they think I enjoyed the part of the order they didn't screw up?  Order from Village diner. The girl that answers the phone is very sweet.  The manager is a jerk.",Attentive and well-organized staff but very mediocre food. I was expecting more from a diner in New York. Not sure what was up with the reuben or what exactly was inside the cheese blitzes as a filling.,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and my kids ordered the chicken fingers. The food was completely flavorless and we left hungry and disappointed. There were at least 4 flies constantly flying by the table, which made eating there even more gross. My husband asked to wrap the leftovers, and as I passed a homeless woman sitting on the diners front step, I almost gave them to her, but I figured she probably wouldn't want them either.","I have passed this place in the last three and a half years without stopping in. I have been hungry many of times and just didn't stop in. So today with time to kill I stopped in. When I entered I was immediately greeted by one of the staff members who said I can sit anywhere I chose. I sat approximately 3 seats in. The waiter came over with a smile and very personable took my order and I asked him a couple question about the business and within a few minutes maybe my food was on the table. I also asked the gentleman who I assumed was a manager, heavyset, tall, handsone gentlemen,possibly Greek I'm not sure. I asked him a few questions about the business as well I was told that the restaurant under the current name has been operating for 7 years. It was called the olympic diner before ,7 years ago. I looked for pictures to compare decor but none found. Currently there's a beautiful green light that runs throughout the building lit perfectly to give you a cozy feeling. The borders are stainless steel that runs around the door and is also found on the ceiling very well shine I did not see any rust spots in the stainless steel. Which is a beautiful thing. There's an old clock that is situated right above the entrance of the door very nice. The bathroom, ladies very clean and the company Cintras has put some color to bathroom toiletries. Which helped the set the bathroom the core. Is even a change in station for the babies. Perfectly thought of. I got to give it to this place clean floors beautiful walls with pictures rose gold color panel in some areas not overburden the place. Now I already complimented the staff and the decor let's talk about prices. I had as you see in the picture two eggs over easy with cheese and grits toasted wheat bread and a cup of coffee which I believe was on the board as a special. My cost came up to $10 and some change I think that's a bit much however I was willing to pay it because everything else was satisfying. I even left a tip which I always do when I'm satisfied. I really really appreciate  that the sugar jar, salt shaker and pepper shaker, as well as the ketchup bottle had no  residue of use on them. They were all clean. I looked around at other tables to see if it was just my table that was clean and every last table behind me and in front of me presented clean white off salt and pepper shaker ketchup jars as well as sugar jars. The stainless steel that surround the border of the wall was shining everything was in place. You know what really caught my attention you know at some restaurants you can go to and look up at the light fixture and they'll be dust hanging off of the hinges that hold the light fixture into the ceiling? At this place each and every one of the fixtures we're clean no dust at all. I certainly appreciate this no dust in the corners no dust or buildup grease on the chairs. I certainly will be back. will return one day with my group which is approximately 6 people and we as a group when they leave a review. I'm sure they will say the same thing if not something better about this place. The only thing I can say that prevented the Classic Diner from getting a five-star is the cashier. I greeted her by saying hello. I did not receive a response from her. I don't know why I'm going to check it up that she did not hear me. However even if you did not hear me if I'm approaching you with the bill the professional thing to do is to say hello how was your meal or hello was everything okay I didn't get that from her. It wasn't until I handed her my money she said hello and I responded with a hello. I thought this was quite odd but nonetheless Maybe she just didn't hear me the truth of the matter I doubt that was the situation. I was going to take a picture of her but chose not to just in case it was my misunderstanding. I noticed that when the men approached her she greeted them smiling. Now when it comes to business I don't see gender or sex I see business and I think that should be the way it should be handled but maybe everyone doesn't think that way. I'll find out when I return with my group if she is  still there. Nonetheless good job Classic Diner good job.",Richmond Hill is my soon to be neighborhood & Im so glad to have been introduced to this diner because I love diner food! One can simply not go wrong with diner food and this place nails it  Their service is great and the interior is super cute and spacious .My go to is always the cheddar  omelette that comes with home fries and toast on the side & I always get a side of turkey bacon  The omelette is perfect every time! It's definitely a neighborhood staple!,"My go to spot when i'm in Kew Gardens. The service is always quick & friendly (for NYC). It's a neighborhood spot were everyone knows everyone.

163,"The service in this place has drastically changed. I had reservations for dinner with my family on a Tuesday night. We ordered drinks first, and then our entrees. We waited for what seemed like 45 mins before being served our dinner. I had to remind our servers about the drinks which we got AFTER our dinner. Wtf is that about? The whole point of getting a beverage is to enjoy it with your meal. The owner walked in just as we were about to leave and checked up on us, which made me a bit relieved that he's still attentive to the customers. He needs to train his employees how to do that because they SUCK. The food is delicious but the portions are drastically smaller now and the prices have gone up. Smh I'm glad there are more halal thai options available now because going to Nur Thai isn't worth it.","What a unforgettable experience, in the WORST way possible. There were several tables available when we got there and spoke to the hostess. The hostess seated people ahead of us and those that came in after us. Then proceeded to tell us that it would be a 20 minute wait.After 40 minutes, we were seated and waited a while for a waiter to arrive. The Phuket Sampler appetizer came out right away because it was pre-made items. Most had good flavor though, except for the bland Firecracker Shrimp. My girlfriend received her soup at the same time I received my Basil Fried Rice entree (which took some time to arrive). There was a mixup on my dish, which they were able to fix quickly. After I finished my entire meal, my girlfriend still hadn't received her Drunken Noodles. We had trouble getting the waiter's attention. They had forgotten the order and were able to give it to us free of charge. Overall, the service was horrendous and the food was okay. In my opinion, the issues stem from the restaurant not being able to handle the massive amount of take out customers and those dining in.","Pretty decor, good food. Quality and quantity can't be beat. They gave us tons of veggies and tofu with both our dishes. I loved all the cute details  Update: returned to Nur Thai, ordered the same dish but received smaller portions. Felt like they were taking advantage. For a curry had hardly any broth. Even smaller then a lunch portion dish. They claimed that they change their bowls but portion is the same. I think the customer knows when the portion is not same or not. Live in the neighborhood, not sure if I will return. Can not forgive them for putting chicken in order of tofu curry. Not vegetarian friendly.",all the flavors are on point. The chicken drunken noodles and their thai steak was very flavorful. Thr mojitos were really good as well. Great decorations and friendly staff. One of the few best halal Thai spots!,"My brother recommended this place to us. We went in on a weekend and was easily able to find seats. The staff is really accommodating and nice. I needed a place to change my daughters diaper and they were very helpful with that. As for the food, it was ok. We got the chicken drunken noodles, lady in red, another whole red snapper dish. For apps, we got calamari, chicken satay and fried dumplings. The dumplings were good but the satay and calamari were not that great. I was excited to try chicken drunken noodles but they were not that impressive either. As for the red snapper dishes, my husband and dad really enjoyed them.So might get that next time. Portion sizes were pretty good and we may return for some halal thai food","One of the best Thai spots in Queens!! Located in Woodside close to Queens Center Mall. This place serves up Halal Authentic Thai Food ! We started with the Wings and Phuket Sampler, it was good portioned and enough for 2 people's. Moved on the entree and I had the Bangkok Steak . It's was so juicy and cooked medium rare . Friend who's is a Halal eater , was so pleased with her Spicy Basil Rice. Ended the dinner with Mango Sticky Rice !! It's a must try dessert .

Smallish portions.",Came here with the family on a Saturday.  It wasn't too busy when we got there but within an hr the place was full to capacity. I order a chicken pad thai which was sooooo salty.  It was so salty that I couldn't finish it. And I hate to send food back so I boxed it and ate it the next morning lol. (Also don't like wasting food lol). Someone from my party got really sick from a mushroom dish. She believes the mushrooms wasn't fully cooked. Poor thang vomited thru out the whole car ride from long island city to Brooklyn.,Came here with a friend for lunch. I was really glad to see that they had lunch specials. I feel like for a thai restaurant it almost has to be standard these days. Anyway I had the pad see ewe and the roti canai. Both were above average and the price was right. I'd definitely want to come back one day but the one annoying thing was that parking was a big pain in this area.,"This place is probably my favorite in town. Every time I happen to stop by in Vernon Blvd, I think of this place. I've come to this place more than 5 times . My favorite in this place is pad se ew , fried rice, and thai iced tea.      Everything was on point as usual , I love their pad see ew and salmon lemongrass. But, soup and pad thai was mediocre this time which can be better though:)        I'll be back again.",This is one of my favorite places in the area. I've been back a few times now and I've ordered delivery from here a few times.(order from their website directly instead of one of the apps and avoid delivery fees)I've had the pad thai and the tom yum and I really liked them but my personal favorite is the kai ra-berd. So simple but its amazing and its my go to whenever I come here,"Steady 3 out of 5Great service, interesting decor, the place is neat, clean and spacious, we had plenty of room. It wasn't busy on Friday night so we didn't have to wait for a table.But food was not so great. And on a pricey side if food vs. price is concerned. Very americanized Thai cuisine, definitely not a place if you are looking for a closer to authentic experience.Be mindful that 20% tip added to parties of 6 & more.Description of what we had and prices - in pictures.Wouldn't come back.",Tuk Tuk
165,"I bought frozen chicken nuggets for my kids, when i got home and opened the box the smell was horrible, thank god i didn't cooked it for them when I checked the expiration date was expired 15 months ago.Be careful when you buy from this store check the expiration date.",Authentic and tasty Lebanese food in a welcoming family run Cafe.,"I am so very upset at this place. Generally share the 5star love. But twice in the past few weeks - chicken shawarma, at least half disgusting fat. Plus, serious gristle. The amount of vile fat was so offensive, seriously nearly vomited. But, puzzling, the chicken meat didn't even taste like chicken, and who knew our contemporary chickens had so much fat. I'm aware it must be an aberration, a failure of quality control, but it's really sad as I try to support every ethnic event, but I'll not be back.","Shish Taouk sandwich - $5Walnut baklava - $1.50I was walking down Queens Blvd tonight looking for a quick place to grab a bite. I saw that Souk El Shater had amazing reviews and decided to give it a try. I ordered the Shish taouk (chunks of chicken breasts) sandwich and at the last second, decided to treat myself to a walnut baklava. The Shish Taouk sandwich did not disappoint! With juicy chunks of chicken breasts, crisp vegetables, tahini and other delicious additions, this seemingly small ""wrap"" was a flavor explosion. Unsurprisingly, I devoured the entire thing before I even got on the subway! Next was the baklava. I'm not usually a fan of sweets, especially given that baklava is usually drenched in honey, but this really surprised me. The phyllo dough was extremely light and crackled at the touch. It was still a bit sweet for my taste but the walnut flavor really shines through and was the perfect morsel.Overall, for only $6.50 and a delightful conversation with the owner Mohammed, I would definitely come back to try some more of what they have to offer","Was in the mood for a beef schwarma and thisPlace was amazing! Everything was super fresh and not greasy at all. Also had a baklava! ReallyGood and super cheap lunch, under 10 bucks","There aren't many Lebanese restaurants in New York, let alone good ones. Although this place isn't a ""restaurant"" what it is, IS GOOD. There literally isn't any other place in NYC where you can get an authentic shawarma sandwich like you can here. And yes, I am counting Bay Ridge and Astoria. This joint is owned and operated by a Lebanese family. They cook main dishes on a daily basis and have homemade desserts plus the chicken and/or beef shawarma sandwiches and plates. Know how you can tell if it's actually Lebanese or even Middle Eastern? It doesn't come with ""white (mayo) sauce"" or with yellow rice that taste more like biryani. It traditionally comes with toum, which is a strong garlic spread and if you get the shawarma plate it'd come with basmati rice.  Enough about all that, this place is friggen good, walla! Take it from a Lebanese gal. There's minimal seating, ample kindness and endless yummy flavors. Not to mention a small grocery area in the back where you pick up real pita bread and some orange blossom water. Enjoy the hell out of it please. Sahtein.",Souk El Shater
166,"I was looking for a good place for lunch and this place was beyond my expectations. I had the chicken and basil pan fried dumplings with soup, you can taste the freshness.",I don't understand the good reviews.  It's probably because the reviewers haven't been outside of Sutphin Boulevard for dumplings.   These are mediocre at best same ones you can buy in Supermarket Frozen Department.  I also had the pre-made chicken fried rice that they  reheated to the point of mushiness. Overrated,"2 blocks north of Jamaica Station - lots of pawn shops, so hock the ring that jerk gave you, buy an acoustic guitar, 4 dumplings and chicken fried rice ($5.50) hop the LiRR to Montauk, meet a surfer named Drake. Poison Drake's wife's lobster roll.  It gets a little hot.  Put the poison in the tool box in the shed, grab the wife's board, train it to Jamaica, hock the board...  repeat. **oh no! You left the guitar. Prints are on it.  Kill the maid too.","This place is sort of a double hidden gem-- it has an unassuming, faded marquee, nestled among the generic eateries and small businesses across the street from the Queens County courthouses. It's amazing that so many people have found it and recognized it. The second reason it's a hidden gem is that, despite being called 'dumpling house,' this is really a primo noodle spot.The dumplings are good too, but being a noodle fiend that's what I usually order. Hot and chewy lo mein is cooked fresh to order in a full size wok. It's not fast food and you may have to wait a little, but it's real food with plenty of meat and veggies. It's fatty and satisfying without tasting greasy.If it's a cold noodle you're after, the sesame noodle is a great specimen of the dish. It has great sesame flavor with a nice amount of cucumber and, it must be said, a spectacular portion size. I always want to stop at half of it but I can never make myself.This place is SLAMMED at lunch time, but no matter how busy the cashier staff is they're always courteous and attentive. It's far above-average service for an eatery of this size that has to turn over this much business. Whenever I get stuck around here I'm always secretly a little happy because I get to come to Beijing Dumpling House. Just look for the red marquee!","In love with the spicy wontons!! I was craving it for the last 2 days but it was a bit of a travel to get wontons... and Uber would've been about $20 one way...Since I was out today doing errands, I stayed on the bus and stopped by here. Ordered the handmade shrimp, pork and chives, and chicken and basil dumplings. Those were good. Ordered 3 spicy wontons. Once I got home my boyfriend and I devoured everything. The sauce in the spicy wontons is awesome. I added more chili peppers at home. I never bought dumplings and wontons on my own until I tried this place out.","Went here after a trip on the LIRR train that is nearby! Was looking for bubble tea and found this location on yelp.You order at the front and there is a seating area in the back. It seems to be a family run business and the lady taking my order was super friendly and smiley! I ordered the dan dan mian and bubble tea combo to go. The total was a few cents over $10.I went to the back to wait for my order. Everything seemed pretty clean- the sriracha seemed to be watered down though- it was very liquidy. My order was done quickly and was super fresh- the takeout box was super hot.The bubble tea was pretty standard. I got the passionfruit bubble tea with no ice. It tasted as it should- nothing special but I enjoyed it. I ate the noodles after a ~15 minute car ride home. The noodles were a little soft for my liking but that might have been because they sat in the closed box? The spice of the beef sauce was definitely there- but it lacked a bit of salt. I added some soy sauce and vinegar at home and they were super yummy after :) it was a really big portion that I was able to have it for 2 meals, and even extra that I had to throw out.If I'm in the area, I would definitely come again! I would love to try the dumplings.",Beijing Dumpling House
167,"We went to brunch here. I got the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and my bf got the huevos rancheros. The chicken sandwich is to die for, it's literally the best chicken sandwich ive ever had. But the huevos rancheros was awful the tortilla used underneath was a fried and terrible. I would highly recommend getting the sandwich but skip on the huevos.","Disappointing brunch. They ran out of coffee, served me brown guacamole, flavorless crab cakes, and didn't refill our water. I won't be going back.","I think the best thing I liked about this place was the music they played. We ordered the salmon and the roasted beet salad. I had asked for the salad to have chicken but they didn't add it to it? I didn't want to be the person to complain about a food order, because the salad was very tasty. Will most likely return here, but may just stick to the drinks.","We went to brunch here. I got the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and my bf got the huevos rancheros.

168,"We decided to go to Loukoumi based on all the great reviews we read and several recommendations from others. Despite several employees sitting around, nobody approached us to greet and seat us. Finally, one of the employees who I think was a busboy approached us and pointed at a table. After sitting there for about 5 minutes, a waitress finally came over to hand us the menus and then quickly walk away. The first thing I noticed when I looked down at the menus was that half the prices had been changed with white out. How unprofessional! If you're going to increase your prices, at least invest in new menus. One of us wanted to order moussaka and another wanted pastichio but they weren't on the menu, however the waitress said they do have them. Again, time to invest in some new menus!I've been to many Greek restaurants and the food here was very overpriced. We ordered glikadakia and keftedes for appetizers. The glikadakia were tasty but very overpriced. The keftedes tasted like regular meatballs, not keftedes, and they were pink inside. We waited a looooong time for these appetizers to finally come out and while we were still eating them, the waitress came by to tell us our entrees were ready and took the plates away which still had food on them! This made no sense and was very unprofessional. The pastichio and moussaka (which were hidden from the menu) were very average. The chicken biftekia were greasy and unappetizing.After receiving the bill, we asked the waitress about the cost of having an event there. She said, ""I don't know"" and sent another waitress over. After asking her a question, she said ""Let me ask the owner"". She went back and forth twice as oppose to the owner just coming out and speaking with us himself. This is no way to run a restaurant. The food wasn't good, but the horrible service is what really turned us off from giving them a second chance.",Yeah- food is good. What's not so great? Paying 17$ for 3 shrimps. I kid you not. See attached picture. This is unacceptable.,"Although the food was okay, the service was horrible Server forgot our second appetizer and then rushed our mains. Out of 5 people, only 4 got their sides. We had to inquire and ensure we get the correct food. As a nice gesture the server informed us that the second appetizer was on the house, but in the end they charged us for it. I only noticed after the fact and they ended up getting us a refund. Please do not lie to your customers. I will not be returning.","This is probably one of my favorite Greek restaurants. The service was outstanding from the minute we walked in. Hubby and I got seated in the back it was a little chilly but nice and romantic. We ordered some house wine and started with the Greek salad. The feta cheese on the salad was creamy and perfect. Crispy and fresh cucumbers and tomatoes. Portion was perfect to share.  Next up, the amazing tender octopus a Must try. The Saganaki (Greek cheese) was also great and creamy inside. It's Pan fried in olive oil. Mmmm The Lemon potatoes and chicken kabob was delicious. No chewy chicken but nice and tender with lots of flavors and huge pieces. We were stuffed. Spyro, I'm guessing owner walked over to ask how our meal was going and looked at my almost empty glass of wine and said, you look like you need some more. I laughed and 2 seconds later a carafe was brought to our table and waitress told us this is from Spyro. Cheers and thank you sir. Oh I forgot to mention that his mother was walking around serving people as well and she is a sweet older lady. We ended our meal with a philo stuffed w/ a semi sweet custard and drizzled with honey.","This is an example of the service making the restaurant. Dont get me wrong, the food was wonderful but Ernest our server made the night for us. It started when we arrived, they were able to get us seated even though we made the reservation for 1h later,  he immediately got my 5 year old started with some potato chips thinking that he would be hungry. Even though he was clearly busy, he made time to explain all the dishes and made excellent recommendations. It was not just Ernest, EVERY member of staff would drop by and make sure we were set or chat with us.At the end of the night Ernest arrived with a cake and candle (pre arranged) and encouraged the whole restaurant to sing happy birthday to my mother in law. All in all it was an excellent experience and probably one of the best dining I have ever had.!!!","Delicious food, great service, nice atmosphere. Came on a Friday night with a reservation (yes they take them) and sat in the outdoor seating out back. We decided to order wine and a handful of starters, but we wish we had more people so we could order more food because it was all so good!",Loukoumi Taverna
169,We ordered the St Peter entree which was mouth wateringThe service was good tooTo go place for sureWill be back again,"I've been meaning to come here for a long time but never actually did since my brother had come here a few years ago and said it wasn't good.  I'll have to circle back with him on that, cause the food was pretty decent.Came here on a Sunday night, I ordered the lamb kabobs, my companions ordered the chicken combo and salmon.The lamb kabobs and the chicken were decent, definitely nothing to write home about.  The salmon though was quite good.  I suppose that's why they call themselves BlackSea Fish & Grill.Since it's in the neighborhood I think I'll give this place another shot, but this time only ordering fish dishes, which I assume to be their specialty.","I had the chicken shish kebab and it was nothing special. It was dry and flavorless. I also had the baklava for dessert which is one of my favorite desserts, but it was a major disappointment, it was also flavorless. The only thing that I did like was the soft, fresh bread they served on the table and that's about it. Also, the service was horrible. We had a bald server who was extremely rude and seemed irritated for no good reason.  I don't know if he was having a bad day or if that's what he's like all the time. Honestly, I wanted to walk out because of his attitude, but I stuck it out because I was too hungry and already half way into my meal. I will not be returning to this place because nothing here made me want to come back, not the food, nor the terrible decor, and certainly not the nasty server.","I don't gravitate towards Mediterranean food often but BlackSea has won me over.  Excellent hummus: fresh, clean, light on the garlic. Baba gounesh had a hint of smokiness. Thick, warm pita delivered to me like it was right out of the oven. The meat though was something special. I ordered the lamb and beef combination platter, which includes two dipping sauces, a cucumber dill yogurt sauce and a slightly zesty red sauce, both go great with the meat but you honestly don't even need it. Tender, with a slight char from the charcoal, and juicy. Just as good was the rice: soft, thick grains soaking up the juice from the meat mixing with roasted peppers and white onions and red onions and carrots and beets- the entree was just $16 and this was a great value.","Was expecting the food to be mediocre but taken by surprise at how tasty it was! We came here because we had no choice (flat tire and waiting for roadside assistance to come).  It was definitely a better option than Domino's 2 doors away. The Turkish bread was so warm and tasty (and super filling so be careful).  Our chicken shish kebab was cooked well and a decent portion to share for 2 people.  Had room for dessert and enjoyed the rice pudding.  I wish the shish kebab came with some sort of sauce because it tasted dry without a tzatziki or something.Price was fairly reasonable! Thought the green tea teapot was a steep price for $7 (i mean it's boiled water and 4 tea bags), but other than that a fairly decent experience!",These guys bake their own breads.   Typically lacking in most places.  But move on to the main course.  Seafood here is knock your socks off goods extensive offering of fresh fish's. Can't be beat.  Affordable too!,BlackSea Fish & Grill

Here is my zero star for only this server.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Very rude and Unprofessional server. It would be understandable not to sit inside while the store will be open in five minutes if the server tell us nicely. He chose to be rude and said we as a customer will block his way while preparing store to be ready.We're Thai we talk with him in Thai so, his tone and attitude is clearly not friendly and unwelcome.

I'm a slow eater and since this is hotpot the food is hot so it slowed down my eating time by double. I wasn't really happy when they came over with the check. -claims wasn't so fresh.Overall it's nice to experience Thai Hotpot once but I'll stick to Chinese hotpot in the future.,"This has became my go to spot when I have hotpot in my mind on hot days and cold days.Staff members are always so nice and friendly besides food.The broth is just so delicious itself, but you can customize the flavor by adding spicy sauces on the side.Plus, all you can eat veggies, meat, seafood all adds up the flavor for you to enjoy as a soup after you finish eating!","Love this cute place! I've been here 4times and every time I'm really satisfied with their food, service and atmosphere. The inteior is colorful and that makes me happy. And their selection of the vegetables and herbs are awsome! Also their garlic rice...delicious!The reason why I only give them 4stars is because we had to leave after spending time for 2hours coz some customers waited for tables. This is reasonable, but to be honest, I wanted to stay there a little more.","We love to hot pot, especially all you can eat! The place is small and food options are limited, but this does not stop us from going back. We love the Thai broth, which we do not see anywhere else in New York. The Tom Zap broth is sour and spicy, very fragrant and flavorful; we love to just drink it. The broth goes very well with pork; we rarely choose sliced pork when we go to other hot pot places but we always order it here. We also love the Thai ice tea, which is the best we've ever had. The tea is flavorful and the milk does not overwhelm the tea flavor. It is not overly sweet either.Another charm of this place is the garlic fried rice! The first time we went, we didn't know there was garlic rice so we ate a lot and were very full. My husband got a bowl to try and omg it was the best fried rice we've had. Couldn't believe how I was able to eat one bowl and my husband two bowls after all the hot pot food we've had. You know how sometimes you get super full and regret eating so much? We were super full in the end but don't regret eating it. The staff here are super friendly and keeps coming to ask if you need anything extra. They are consistently friendly every time.Come here early during winter months because it's always packed. They offer free hot pot on the day of your birthday, so it's like under $15 per person for both of us, super worth it!We took away one star because of the limited food options and the broth was not as tasty the last time we went. Overall, highly recommend",Jaew Hon New York

Must try chicken empanadas and pasteles.","I went on the 3rd Annual  boat ride on August 31,2019; sponsored by this restaurant.  The food was not that good. They served a dmall portion of either pernil and or dried up fried chicken. For the price we paid for food and boat ride they should of at least provided a drink to help dried food go down.First and last time I go on this Sala cruise.","I ordered a cuban sandwich the pernil was tasty but for $18 its not worth it, i could get a lobster roll fo r that price , also ordered pernil with arroz con gandules and you can se by the pictures it looks empty again, put an extra spoon of rice your not going to go bankrupt. I've had better pernil for half the price. I know you are located in Astoria and rent is high but make it balanced","I had heard about the freakin Rican for a while now on social media and being a Puerto Rican I had to test this out. I took my mom there that's the only way it can pass the test we started with some empanadas, surullitos, and alcpaurrias and they grabbed me from the start. The surullitos were perfectly done and the empanadas full of flavor, but what really sold me was the alcapurrias. These alcapurrias took me back to PR to my great aunts house they tasted just like hers and I hadn't had those in years...RIP Titi. The pork chops were just like I was at home and mom was making them fresh, the mofongo just full of flavor and perfectly cooked and delicious. And the chicharron de pollo and tostones perfectly crisp and juicy. And then to wash it all down with an ice cold Malta was just amazing. But the thing that really draws you in is just walking in the door smelling the aromas and the ambiance all the Knick knacks from Puerto Rico the sound of the coquis the music in the background and the small cozy warm family feeling. The fraakin Rican is an amazing place and a place I'd be returning to indefinitely and one place I would highly recommend if you want a true taste of Puerto Rican home cooked food.","Wow! What a find... We made a special trip to Astoria/Woodside to see what all the fuss was about. And boy were we excited by what we found...If you explore my reviews of restaurants in San Juan, PR, you'll see that we've been to just about all the recommended places, both high-end, and hole-in-the-wall. Let me just say- without exaggerating even a little bit- this little restaurant has the best Puerto Rican food we've EVER had. Like ever...I love pernil and I love chicken chicharron- the versions from ""The Freakin Rican Restaurant"" are numero uno on my list. Furthermore, I don't even like beans but the version we had here was Michelin-star worthy.Throw in some house-made hot sauce and down-homey, casual, friendly service/ambiance and you got yourself a winner.

Stop reading! What-is-wrong-with-you! Go now!...","The search is over.....thank goodness!!!!I have tried with no success to find an authentic Spanish restaurant locally and then got a tip about The Freaking Rican.  Its FREAKING AMAZING.  I tried to go twice but the lines were too long (which is a great sign).  I was finally able to get back and was able to get a table.  The cooks hands have been blessed by the Latin gods....I thought my mother was working in the kitchen (it tasted identical to my moms Spanish food).  A very friendly and attentive staff is always a nice perk.  The inside was adorned with Latin accents in the decor, salsa music playing in the background and the scent of familiar Spanish dishes made my experience a solid 10.....for a minute I thought I was in Puerto Rico.The shrimp was fresh and cooked perfectly, the mofongo was to die for.  The fried chicken pieces was spiced perfectly and the dessert was the icing on the cake.  As I was leaving I had the privilege to meet the owner, shook his amazing hand and thanked him for a wonderful meal....he was friendly and gracious.Can't wait for my next trip.  Don't fret if your feeling lazy they have several delivery options so there is NO reason not to place your order.",The Freakin Rican Restaurant
172,"Came here since I live in the area. Came for brunch and I ordered the egg flatbread and my sister ordered the Egg Benedict. My food was good, not great. Nothing that ""wow'ed"" me. My sisters Benedict has the THINNEST piece of ham. The food itself was okay. The inside of the restaurant is absolutely beautiful. It felt like a small place you'd find in Manhattan. However, the service was HORRIBLE. I think the bartender was my server or something, but he NEVER checked up on me and He was never on the floor. I originally came for their bottomless brunch, but never even got the chance to order drinks because he never came back to the table. Never asked me if my food was okay, if I need anything else, etc. I ended up asking a busser for more water, juice, napkins, ketchup, etc. After my meal, I waited in the front to talk to manager about how horrible my service was and my server came to me and asked me if i wanted to be seated!!! WHAT??? Thats how oblivious this guy was! It sucks when restaurants have so much potential but it's ruined from the lack of service they provide.","Great atmosphere, nice staff, food was good. Service was very slow so I think food might have suffered. I will no doubt try again though.","1. Blood Mary had no celery, nor pepper and salt. It was tasteless.2. Eggs Benedict was very disappointing for a Bistro. Hardly any Hollandaise sauce on it, one slice of cheap ham on each muffin, and the muffin was very small.3. Bus boys were very kind.4. Waiter never came around and asked how the meal was. 5. Steak and Eggs was very good. 6. Crepes were good. 7. Home Fries were not flavorful.","Delicious French cuisine in the area! I came right when they opened for lunch on a Friday and was seated immediately. There were so many tables inside and the decor was really nice, making you feel like you're in a high-end restaurant. The service was good but the food did take a while to come to the table.We ordered the fried calamari, mussels in white wine sauce, chorizo flatbread (which comes with a side salad and fries), pignoli-nut crusted scallops, steak frites, and the cavatelli and filet mignon. Everything was really tasty, especially the scallops! The steak was big and a bit dry. It was also more cooked than I preferred. They also have tasty flatbreads that I would recommend as well. Overall, good service with yummy food and a nice atmosphere.","Overall the venue is very nice, service was good - staff was friendly, dont always get things right but  it was still a pleasant experience.I came here with my boyfriend for brunch.  The menu of offerings looked diverse and had many items that looked great.I ordered the crepe with fillet mignon, the boyfriend has lobster roll.  We also ordered Bloody Mary and Bellini with our meal (the brunch drinks are not included with meal fyi).  Drinks are strong and I am not sure I was expecting that t ok be the case.  Bloody Mary was ok.My crepe itself was nice and chewy in texture.  The beef was diced inside cooked with mushroom sauce.  Given it was suppose to be nice cut I was a little disappointed as the beef was cooked so well done it became dry.  Boyfriend's lobster roll tasted fine, nothing out of the ordinary.  The compliementary croissants were actually very nice.I think overall the food was decent however nothing stood out that would make me come back and try again soon.","It's a shame, disappointed yet again.

I don't understand the other reviews at all, this is mediocre food at best let alone daring to call it French Cuisine.  My party of four left very dissatisfied and vowed not to return.The food was very inconsistent, one dish ok, then the others were meh to worse.  The menu is quite extensive so the chef needs to churn out dishes from every category; which could be the issue. The only food item that saved this review from being a 1 star was the scallops. I'll give credit to the Chef here, he knows his scallops. Both the Scallop appetizer and the entree which he custom made for us, Scallops over risotto, were cooked perfectly.  The pairings/items that accompany with - not so much.For instance, in the Scallop appetizer plate, it's three seared scallops nice and plump, served over spinach. I love spinach but these were over cooked and soggy. With the custom risotto dish, the risotto and seared scallops were delicious on its own but he drizzled a brown gravy like au jus. Didn't need it at all.  It was adding color but no value to the taste almost masking the good parts of the dish.The small plates:The moules with white wine and garlic sauce we had to send back. I never send back food!! The Mussels arrived almost half empty which leads me to believe they were sitting under the shells or the pieces fell out in the pot - still in the kitchen. Of the two I sampled, both had sand! It was terrible. The waiter apologized and took it off the bill. Thanks for that at least.  We were so not happy about it.The escargot has to be right... It's a French Restaurant. Ours had plenty of pesto and the toasted bread medallions on top were a nice touch. But too much oil and not enough garlic. It didn't lend any flavor to the escargot itself. Decent for what it was and at this point, my expectations were shot. The buffalo chicken meatballs were exactly as stated, buffalo sauce and yes, they were meatballs. Skip. Nothing to write here.The risotto fritters funny enough were shaped like Meatballs and had great contrasting colors. They were more charred than I would prefer but it was offset by the rouguefort cheese - creamy, sauce like. Again, looked disappointing but tasted ok.The best thing of the evening and that's not saying much, were the cocktails we had and the warm baguettes. The Spritzer, the Strawberry Basil Gin, and the St. Germaine cocktails we had, we enjoyed hence the second star.  Sorry folks, service was not great either. While the waiter was gracious to remove the Mussels app that was not good off our bill, he was not good with the overall service. We didn't get serving spoons, no fresh plates. Our bread plate should not have been our dining plate. It was just a mess of an evening. Never returning. SMH.",Aperitif Bistro Bayside
173,"Ever seen the series ""True Blood""? Well, think about a Louisiana, Texas-style bar with desiccated animals and devilish lights next to windowless bar counters straight from the series - except this one is located in the middle of downtown Queens. Yes. But the food is even better. The wings are to die for in the most bloody of ways. Order the Savage wings. They are soft, tender, juicy and with the right amount of sauce to make you forget all your life's problems. This place rocks. Definitely coming back again",Came here several times while pregnant and enjoyed it. Came back on a slow Sunday afternoon- tons of open tables and was told we couldn't bring in a stroller. My child is not yet sitting in a high-chair and we didn't feel like holding our 20-lb baby while drinking beer and eating wings. Last time we'll ever go. Obviously a rule thought up by owners without children in a city where mostly young families live. We'll take our little man somewhere else!,"After a week of trying to speak to management after an incident where I was verbally attacked by an overly aggressive and visibly drunk man at the bar while at least 4 bar staff watched without intervention, I was chased down at a gas station by the bartender from that evening telling me 'what should the establishment have done to intervene? What did I want his boss to say? and that the since this bartender was there and knew the man, he knew I wasn't scared.' I tried to explain that my perception of feeling threatened was dictating my experience of the events. He told me I was unwelcome in the bar and I was informed that just because someone argues with me doesn't mean they are 'going to follow you home,stab, rape and murder you.'","Me and my wife with our couple friends were here last night.Damn! Recommend Poutine and Buck n Hog for appetizers! And for wings? I recommend SNOW(White Bbq Sauce), Smokey, Sticky and Dragon Wings!! Best wings in town! No doubt! ‍Excellent and friendly service! Very cool and great  ambiance as well!I will definite come back here again!","We came by Friday night, went to seat ourselves per the ""seat yourself"" sign and at the last second a guy swoops in to tell us we can't sit at the only low table left. They're saving it for larger groups. It's a table for 4 and there's two of us.At this point the place is probably half full, considering all the high tables and empty bench seats. If my partner wasn't recovering from a knee injury we would have taken one, but high tables aren't great for us so tonight was not our night in this place.The food looked good, so I'll give them some credit for that. I'd love to be able to review it but unfortunately not our day.",My Coworker and I came here for a quick to go lunch. Honestly a great establishment with great people working there. The bartender i can't remember her name (the lovely blonde) and the Chef were funny and interacted well with us. Let's just say Good Vibes Only. The decor in the huntress definitely fits the name. We absolutely loved it! Will be going back!!,THE HUNTRESS whiskey n' wings
174,"Charming bar with a not so charming manager. Beware the ramen-headed Tea Nazi. I used to enjoy Sparrow when I lived in the neighborhood. It has always been a little overpriced but the food and vibe were good. Unfortunately, I had one of the most uncomfortable experiences with the manager who was beyond rude to us for no reason. We stopped in around 7 PM last night to and it was pretty slow. It was cold out and I had a tea I needed to finish.I asked the friendly blonde server if it was OK if. She said it was no problem and we thanked her for her flexibility. We are perusing the bar menu when a middle aged woman with a nose ring (TN) informs me that I will have to throw it out. Her tone is nasty to say the least. I calmly tell her that I'm almost done with it, we're ordering cocktails, and that the other server said it was OK to finish. TN Narrows her eyes with absolute contempt and says ""Who told you THAT? Someone who's NOT THE MANAGER?"" as she darts a dirty look between myself and the offending server. I probably looked at her like she was crazy because she was acting just that. Look, I've worked in the service industry. I understand that dealing with people sucks but I cannot emphasize enough that we were polite and calm despite her obvious hostility over something so petty. The other server sheepishly apologized for the manager's rudeness but it was not her fault at all and I honestly feel bad for the employees who have to work with such a rude and unreasonable person.I would say the final straw came when I got my teeny cocktail. An Aperol spritz is usually served in a pretty sizable wine glass and for $13 it was a pitiful amount. At this point, they already had our business and it was cold out so I resigned myself to a couple of rounds. TN called me ""sweetie"" a few times which gave me full body ick. -_- I wanted to burn some sage because her vibe was so bad. I understand that I'm not a regular but don't be a dick to your customers if you want them to return.","I'm not a fan of writing bad reviews. In fact as an avid foodie I hate the tattle tale mentality that social media brings with it however I just wanted to bring this to others attention. I have frequented this tavern a handful of times and have 0 negative things to say about the quality of the food they serve. In fact for a bar it has way above average food. The only complaint I have are the prices...I recently ordered pickup of a few things I really like on their menu. One being the kale salad, beets, carrots, etc with pomegranate dressing and i opt to add Manouri or grilled Halloumi cheese.  On this occasion I ordered two kale salads, both with Manouri adder, a veggie burger with cheese, a seasoned fries and a side of coleslaw. The total was $75.84. This is Astoria...I get it..it's a gastropub that's been featured on some shows and the owner is a fellow Greek but it's a complete turnoff to pay that kind of money for bar takeout. I recommend trying the food but please be prepared to spend NYC high traffic tourist prices.","Worst Brunch in long time. My wife ordered eggs cooked overhard and they brought them medium. They took them back and two minutes later the same plate came back, they took the same eggs and burnt them, still leaving the yolk not cooked all the way, instead of doing them again. My egg sandwich was supposed to be with scrambled eggs, came with the egg cooked as omelette. Mimosas at $9 each not great and expensive for a brunch.Gave two stars because herbed fries were good. Not coming back.","This location has great food and even better employees. Mike the bartender is professional and friendly. I recently watched him work a large group of people and he was fast, efficient and never made anyone wait. Great jobGot back in town on Monday night. First stop Sparrow for great food and even better drinks. Mike is still nailing it.","This location has great food and even better employees. Mike the bartender is professional and friendly. I recently watched him work a large group of people and he was fast, efficient and never made anyone wait. Great job.","I really liked The Sparrow Tavern... We came last Friday night and it was super trendy, the draft list looked great, and the food menu looked even better. It's right around the house from my house, which is the biggest perk of them all. Sparrow Tavern is understated, low-key, no frills. The prices are decent and you have a great meal. The service on a Friday was a little light - one server had about 10 tables, so that made the turnarounds a bit slow on drinks, etc. but overall great spot. For food we went with wings, and I had the falafel sandwich for my meal. We also got a side of tater tots. As spot that has tots is fab in my little black book.PS since moving to Astoria I've been all about the falafel. It's bomb. BLESS UP.",The Sparrow Tavern
175,Ordered take out today and was able to pick it up within 10 to 15 minutes. The staff was super friendly and nice. It was all good until I bit into a roll and a bone stabbed my mouth. Had to spit the whole thing out. I tried to finish the rest but was stabbed by another bone again and almost threw up. I couldn't finish the rest. Not sure if I would come again...,"I went here for buffet lunch $17.Their food not very good as review. Service is good.If you left some foods, they will charge you $1 each.","Came here on a Thursday night around 5:30. It was pretty calm, not too busy. Food - mediocre at bestSetting - sat us under the vent, it was so uncomfortably cold, all our kitchen dishes got cold before we took a second bite.","The best AYCE restaurant. The sashimi is fresh. The waiter are friendly with nice smilie. Will definitely go back. When you order salmon skin salad, Crab salad or seaweed salad, they don't put any lettuce underneath the salad like the other AYCE restaurant.","went here for the AYCE sushi lunch. service was great. all the staffs are friendly and they try their best to accommodate the guests. how it works is just write what you want on the paper and give it to them. be careful that the rolls come in 6 while the nigiri sushi comes in 1 piece, don't get it mixed up or else you might wrote 10 for the rolls and end up having 60 pieces the quality of the fish is pretty good and it tastes fresh. salmon skin and tempura were really good. the eel and avocado roll barely has any eel though, so it just feels like avocado roll really. i think they nailed mostly the salmon products. i feel like they take quite some time to prepare the food though. curious to try the dinner menu sometime because it has so much more variety and sashimi options. overall quite satisfied with the experience and won't say no to coming back","By far the best ayce sushi dining experience. The ambiance was nice, place was very clean, service was amazing (shoutout to our waitress Christina who was everything a waiter should be) and sushi was great for the value. Salmon sashimi was a good size, squid ikura was not slimy and red clam was fresh minus one piece that had some sand (only negative experience). Also the rolls were not packed with a lot of rice and had just the right amount.Recommend getting the appetizer: Salmon Dragon Ball - spicy salmon with tempera flakes topped with sliced avocado. We came for lunch and got the dinner menu (weekday $26.99). Worth it, 2 people came out to be around $58. Definitely coming back!",Akino
176,"Pops diner: an old standby in Flushing NY where breakfast is served all day every day and daily specials include meatloaf sandwich, oxtail stew and various other daily meals.Daily soup specials (today was yankee bean or chicken noodle).","What's not to like here??Everytime I come, the scrambled eggs are fluffy, the omelettes full of veggies and fillings, the home fries...just make sure you have some with breakfast. And I wouldn't eat anything but breakfast here just so I could get home fries, they are that good.The breakfast sausage, why can't I replicate this at home? They are plump, bursting with flavor, and charred so slightly on the grill, I just love them here and always get them as an additional side.The prices are ridiculously cheap so the cash only policy is no biggie. parking is probably a challenge as is finding seating during peak hours..so come early and often.ps..the coffee is typical diner coffee ie really bitter and watered down so just skip it. go with OJ and grab coffee later at a real coffee place",My weekly spot. No other place can replace my pop diner breakfast. Corn beef hash is nothing short of amazing. Especially with over easy eggs.,Best diner in the area!!!!!! You want your eggs? Sausage? Toast with lots of butter? This is the place. Get some. Great staff and so friendly!,Great classic breakfast !Prices not bad and service is goodI would recommend this place Bacon was great!,"Came here after getting out of the airport. Breakfast was yummy. I had a chicken club that was delicious. We also had a grilled cheese and a waffle. The food was fast, hot, and the customer service was great. It seems like it's 'the' diner to go to in the area so I'm glad we were able to find close parking and pop in before heading to the museum. Overall-- great service and great food!",Pop's Diner
177,"So let me start with the good, their breakfast is AMaZZZING, tradition Latin or continental they do not disappoint, cocktails on point . Dinner however is an utter disaster, bland beans, dry and chalky sides, over cooked meat with absolutely nothing to awaken your pallet. Just stop at Brunch Pops and leave dinner to the Moms.","Went in for brunch to a mostly empty restaurant and an apathetic waitress came over. After putting in our order, we were IGNORED for over 45 minutes. They never came over, never checked in with us to tell us why our food was delayed, just rearranged silverware. The WORST service I've ever experienced in Queens. I was so annoyed I left before the food arrived.  Nothing is worth that level of incompetence. These people obviously don't give a fig about customer service. Any positive reviews are baffling","Very, very, very poor service waiter not attentive. Had to ask for water,napkins,salt, pepper. Had an early dinner 5:30pm place was empty 5 people in total. 3 at the bar and a friend and myself sitting at a table. Both orders came back wrong I think this is under new ownership because they DO NOT serve traditional Spanish food like when it first opened a couple of years ago. Won't EVER go there again. New management and menu sucks.....","If you're looking for REALLY GREAT food and a very nice atmosphere here in Jamaica NY, this is the place.Both my wife and I came two days in a row because it was so good.You MUST try their Longaniza sausage, EXTREMELY good.","Was in the area & we decided to stop into this lil Spanish restaurant....  very nice & open dining room with plenty of seating ...Love the old nostalgic wood workmanship all around ... Very clean !!!The waitresses were very nice & friendly ... took our order right away .....

I liked it .... just had to get it well done with a lil crisp & it was delicious ... as well as their home fries ... portions are a lil on the smaller side which we didn't mind .... we all need to get back to what a normal size portion should be .....

Had a strawberry margarita that was on the rocks n no salt. It was good I felt my drink,Salvatorian American terrible popusas made my friend sick for days,"If you're looking for delicious food and great drinks for a reasonable price, then this is the place to go to.I had never tried a Pupusa until I came to this place, and wouldn't go anywhere else for one.

From the owner, to the cooks in the kitchen, they are all ready to cater to you! Such a chill spot with great vibes! I almost always meet someone new there, so that's always a plus, to have very welcoming people :)",Excellent food Love their drinksGood service Very must try the pupusas. Delicious Nice Romantic intimate place,"Very very fresh and the pupusas are so good here. I ordered four pupusas and they were all spot on, especially the Revuelta and Pupusa Loca. The pupusas were served with a side of curtido and tomato sauce. I really liked the curtido, which is a Salvadoran cabbage relish... it went really well with the pupusas.Revuelta - it came with cheese, refried beans, and pork. It was really good. I would recommend. Pupusa Loca - it came with cheese, shrimp, brisket, pork rinds, and beans. This one was really good. It's like a party in the mouth. Definitely something I would order again. Queso con carne - this was a pupusa with cheese and flank steak. It's very very simple and good. It's great if you want to go light.Queso con camarones - this was actually a customized Pupusa with cheese and shrimp. It's good and light. Overall, super filling and the staff were all very friendly. The place is medium in size with good vibes and decent amounts of indoor and outdoor seating, but expect them to be filled up pretty quick during busy hours. Will definitely be back to try their other dishes and drinks.",Salvatoria Kitchen & Bar
179,This update has nothing to do with the food but everything to do with the people that work here. I will never support and give my money to an establishment that turns a blind eye to domestic violence directly outside of their restaurant. Especially when I as a customer come in and say that I would like a table for two but first need assistance in calling the police to report the  explicitly abusive altercation going on in front of their store! I was told no they can't and won't call for help. I will never support an establishment that turns away someone asking for help! And neither should you.,This place is a hidden gem.  The food is consistently good.  The service is professional.  I can't stand the name of the restaurant but that's my opinion.,"Had lunch & all I can say is that it was not appetizing. Chicken very dry, sandwich is very plain. Potatoes were messy & not tasty. Greens tasted like dirt. Eggs were not the best. Not somewhere I would recommend or ever want to try again. Fries were the only good thing. Definitely overpriced.",Wonderful piece of meat. I'm sorry but I'm too busy to be writing this up. I have to enjoy this marvelous piece of steak.

Flavorful dumplings in a thin wrapping with just the write amount of chili oil and spice on top! There are a couple tables but don't expect to stay there and eat. It gets chilly inside in the winter!

CASH ONLY.","We came here before to the US Open and decided to make a day out of our time there. We came here after reading the reviews and ordered the wonton dumplings with spicy sauce and the spicy pork chili oil noodles. The wontons were great, nothing special, but a really decent set of dumplings for a great price. The noodles were hands down the most incredible thing to eat. They were salty, oily, and just spicy enough to add a little zing. We loved it and would have ordered more if we didn't have to leave!The downside is that there aren't many chairs and the service isn't great. The seating area is super cramped and doesn't look the most clean. The service people at the front were also not very friendly, but I didn't mind too much. I paid in cash, but unsure if the place is exclusively cash only.",I dislike when places get noted on tv or a magazine. All it does is bring people that would have normally bypassed these hole in the wall placesPrices rise and the loyal customers that support these places over the years like me go elsewhere.I went in recently all I saw were tourist with suitcases. I remember when the dumplings were half  price they are now this was only about 3 years ago. Service can be slow as they are prepared on demand so they are hot and fresh. The wrapping on these dumplings are more like the ones you find in Shanghai just the right texture to hold the filling inside.I think its the hot oil and dried mixure on top that makes them stand apart from others in the area.The soups are limited usually only available in AM as it seems later in the say he just concentrates on number 6 I think it is.I am glad i found me a more reasonable not si touristy place in the area I can go to now.,"Finding myself alone in downtown Flushing, slighty buzzed and feeling great after an excellent happy hour experience nearby I start considering my food options to soak up some of the alcohol in my system. After 5 years of wanting to try White Bear the stars have aligned...All the reviews are dead on about this dingy, hot, cramped space with furniture that has seen much better days decades ago. I order a #6 (Is there anything else worth while on the menu?) the man tells me to have a seat. Soon after I am handed a dense plate of 12 wontons covered in pickled vegetables, scallions, spicy power and chili oil.. I dive in..The wontons have a nice, thin & silky wrapper around a tasty filling, but to my taste buds most of the flavor comes from the topping and chili oil. It has a nice balanced heat, but I add some of the red chili paste from the container on the table to give a bit more of kick. The spice and the warm summer night help me burn off the last of my slight buzz. Now sober, I walk back to my car ready for the ride home.

Almost the same level as restaurants. My guess is because of the rent increases and they had to reflect it on their price. They will even charge you extra if you want to have a take out box. But a box for 25 cent?! I'm sorry I can't help thinking that it's a rip off. I don't think a plastic bag and box cost that much since I believe they purchase it with wholesale price. I understand if I need to pay extra for the box but they are trying to make money out of it and that's unacceptable. I don't think I will come back again because to me it doesn't really make sense to go there if it's as expensive as in the restaurant.,"Multiple vendors with many selling the same types of cuisine.

My friend introduce me to this famous mall in flushing which there is a hidden food court on the lower level of this mall. This call New World Mall Food Court are such a lovely place to eat. So I came down to this food court and I am really obsessed in which restaurants to choose. So much great food in varieties of restaurants. Have be drooling!    When it all came into decision, I have order this called Jian Bing, which is like a crepe with ham and sweet and chilly sauce inside it. I really love it, as the sauce is so great and the crepe is very crunchy and chewy. I really love the feel of taking the bite. Also I have order some BBQ on stick, which i love how it also have cruchiness on the outside! My friend order a japanese bowl called oyaka don, which is egg and chicken on ricebowl. I took a spoon full and it is very tasty! This mall really have some great foods!   This place is lovely and also alittle crowed. The food court is huge but also so many people! People really love this place, also me. The only cons is that there are no signal, but you can always ask the store to provide you with wifi password. Good place for food!",One of my favorite places to eat while in flushing. Convenient one stop shop for all your cravings. There are a variety of cuisines from Szechuan to dumplings to desserts. My favorite place has got to be the small mixed pot place in the corner and bubble tea. Seating can be difficult on weekends but ok other days of the week. I would recommend better attention to bathroom cleanliness.,"We sampled food from 6 different vendors over the course of 2 days. I highly recommend the ramen and udon vendor. The tonkatsu ramen was really good and the egg was so perfect. It's also a good deal at $9. Keep in mind most places charge a $5 deposit to make sure their bowls are returned. The Banh mi from the Vietnamese vendor was really good but they weren't that busy and they seemed almost annoyed at having to make it for me, like they'd rather not be doing anything. Almost everywhere is cash only. The tables and chairs could stand to be cleaned more often and there was a poop smell in some places around the food court that might have been the stinky tofu sold at some vendors, I'm not sure... Overall, this is a great place to visit to sample many different types of food in one place at decent prices.",New World Mall Food Court

We came when they were a pop-up, I think they were testing to see if they could come back? I heard a rumor they were closed for a while. Their menu doesn't have much, and the food isn't that good. It's basic and is pretty tasteless. They have a lot of potential, but I don't see a lot of effort being put in. Save your money.","This is probably the WORST dinner I have had in awhile. We came here after reading the reviews and saw that they had AYCE mussels on Mondays. Well, you are better off having a Fish Filet sandwich from McDonald's because it at least has some type of flavor. The absolute worst interpretation of mussels in white wine I have ever had in my life. Completely lacked any type of seasoning or garlic or flavor, it tasted as if it was sitting in dirty hot saltless seawater. We ordered a burger and fries for my son who loves any type of burger and even he refused to eat them. That tasted as if they sprinkled chicken boullion all over it. Disgusting and disappointed. We did mention our displeasure to the staff who only said, sorry. Sorry? Ugh. The cook needs replacing or the recipe needs replacing. Never again. I will stick to the spots in the city I go to where the mussels are DELICIOUS. We did not even finish the mussels as we wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible.","I loved this place initially, but it has failed 3 times in a row. Disinterested wait staff - very burned French fries- cremated actually- insipid steak, a rib eye,The previous time- again it was over cooked fries. It's not okay to recook them several times, Over cooked burgers.An espresso machine might be an idea.Sad, as it was excellent.","Love the food.  This place is so yummy, everything that I have tried here has been delicious. Food:-Calamari - a favorite. It is always crispy and fresh and so good.-Cod and risotto - so good.  It was so good that even my picky grandma, who only eats Chinese food, ate her entire order.  The cod was flaky and risotto creamy, everything went together so well.  -Fries - with burger order or mussels - are crispy on the outside and soft inside - the best-Specials - they change but always sounds appealing and never disappointPlace:- Dimly lit location. They have wooden benches and seating.  Very neighborhood feel.- Outdoor seating in the back of the restaurant when the weather is warmerWish I lived closer so that I can come back more often.","Great food with fantastic service. This is a hidden gem. Their roasted chicken is delicious, juicy and tender. More importantly, it has been ridiculously consistent ovee the years. I have been to quaint for 4 years and counting. I recall the same exact taste and texture for as long as I can remember.Service is top notch as well. Definitely a great place to go","Decent place in the neighborhood to grab a Happy Hour drink. The pour was generous. The garden in the back is a cute little spot to catch up with friends, if the weather is good.",Quaint
184,"This place is a hit or miss.  There's always a very long wait for a sandwich.  They're slow or oven always broken or not working right.  Place is so small, you can't even turn around so you're forced to wait outside.  Imagine in the winter time.  A lot of their products sell out before 10 am.  Don't get why they don't stock more of the highly demanded stuff, like ciabatta.  They have it in the menu but always sold out no matter what time.  An hour after they're opened....sold out.  On a better note, their sandwiches and pastries are delicious but not worth waiting 30 minutes for in the summer heat or winter cold.","An absolute staple of Ridgewood. The biscuits and every employee is the real MVP. The food, the staff, the coffee and the vibe are always on point. The wait is worth it every time.",Deadass hungover stumbled on this place and got a fully loaded on a cheese roll. I am cured. I can run a marathon right now,Delicious.Wonderful breakfast sandwich evar.I've been to many place that offer breakfast sandwich. From weird creepy corner deli's to really expensive $30 breakfast sandwich in Manhattan. I say that this place is by far my favorite place of them all. I only been here once and stumbled upon it by chance. I live in the neighborhood and really haven't noticed it before. This place is gorgeous. Lovely cashier and the cook who delivered my food is hella cute. I want to have a chat with her but I rather not disturb her when they're soo many customers waiting for their order.Anyways... sandwich is the best. Crunchy yet soft bun... cheese cooked to melty perfection... and egg/bacon has a lovely taste. I tend to ride my bike past this place every morning to work. Wish I could stop by more if I wasn't always making it to work at the nick of time. Huff. Only thing I'm not a fan of is the orange juice. For the high price it is... it doesnt taste all that great. Highly recommend this place.,"Stellar coffee/espresso drinks, amazing sandwiches, and indulgent baked goods. The only thing that would make this place better is more room and maybe some rotating specials. It has become a neighborhood institution!",I loved this cute little Shoppe!  It is super small and not entirely comfortable but The coffee & food are yummy. The staff is awesome. We got the New Yorker breakfast sandwich on a biscuit. And a tuna salad over some spinach.,Norma's Corner Shoppe
185,"You will not find better authentic Italian food in the state of New Jersey!Unless maybe your Gramma from Italy makes it.If you don't know what to order:Try the  Meatball appie, Burrata salad, pappardelle bolognase, & YESSS the chef's signature short ribs. Seriously though everything is wicked good here.",Based on the reviews we thought we were going to be wowed. Tried the hangover pizza and thought it was ok. The pics / visual looks better than it tastes. The pizza is very very thin. With ingredients made it too heavy so was very soggy / drippy. Outside crust end was a little burnt. My son enjoyed the burgerService was ok. They were nice but weren't friendly. Cute cozy rustic look and feel.,"Living close by to this restaurant, I keep wanting to give this place a second chance but each time the experience is disappointing. I find the food too expensive for what it is and the pizza pretty bland. The portions are always too small. The wine is OK. The last time I went was definitely the deathblow, I am not going back ever. I went with my boyfriend and a friend during the winter. We asked to have a table in the back because it was absolutely freezing by the door.  The manager was incredibly rude and unwilling to accommodate us. He refused by saying that all the other tables had been reserved. We stayed an hour or so and all the other tables remained empty. The manager could have definitely moved us, and when we told him so, he couldn't care less. I noticed the waiter was trying to make up for his manager's rudeness. But unfortunately it didn't make up for our bad experience. To top it off, the food was still overpriced and the portions way too small. No more comeback for me.","Stumbled in here after a weekend urban exploration landed us wandering around a semi industrial zone in Astoria.   It was 90 and humid and we swore the first place we found that served beer would be our oasisLucky us to stumble upon Vesta!   The interior is cool colors and the Slovak manager super welcoming. But the food!  Can't speak to how they do Italian as we were there brunch time but they serve probably one of the best burgers in the city! I rarely order burgers as they tend to repeat on me later but the meat served here was delicious, high quality and perfectly prepared.  Hours later I didn't feel sick or stuffed, just wistful in remembering the lusciously satisfying taste of a perfect burger with caramelized red onions and a potato bread bun with just the right amount of salt to set off the flavor of the beef.But then the  Baby Jesus cake was a revelation!  The caramel sauce is exquisite.  I would go here just for this.... A quick uber ride from the Upper East Side  and this meal is still affordable.Going to go back in a few weeks when my caramel loving friends are back in town.","Vesta is a reliable neighborhood Italian spot. It's not going to be the greatest Italian food you'll ever have, but it's above average on most nights, even if their pasta isn't al dente typically. Their pizzas are to me their standout dish, along with some of their appetizers.  The pizzas are thin and crispy and have somewhat inventive toppings.  Pastas, as mentioned, aren't usually al dente, which is a shame, because they're often quite delicious flavor-wise. Service is always friendly and even on crowded nights pretty efficient.","Vesta is a small and pleasant Italian restaurant in Astoria.Service was polite and efficient. It was super busy on the Sunday night I went, and in turn quite loud, but it wasn't unbearable and obviously was a good sign that people like the food.  I sat at the bar and ordered a Peroni and the orecchiette with pork sausage, swiss chard, garlic, chili & grana padano.  The pasta wasn't al dente but had a very nice flavor.  I will be back!",Vesta
186,"Ordered 45 minutes ago. There are only a few other people here. And, my veggie burger still isn't out yet. Craziness.I wouldn't come back here because the wait is insane and it's not even busy. I couldn't imagine how long it would be if it was crowded.","Stop what you're doing and get your tummy to this sandwich shop. They have only been open for a year, but this little sandwich shop has the food to make it last. They have burgers, they have sandwiches, they have fries, they have alcohol, and they have buttermilk biscuits smothered in honey butter. Let me say that again, THEY HAVE BUTTERMILK BISCUITS SMOTHERED IN HONEY BUTTER. I had an Arnold Palmer, Steak Sandwich, Seasonal Vegetables and the Buttermilk Biscuits with Honey Butter. I was a fat kid at heart here and I didn't care at all. Get there and show support to a newly opened lunch spot. Order and eat to your stomachs content!","This place has really good food. Burgers are great. Cooked to order as requested. Here is my gripe. I live in Howard Beach, exactly 2.6 miles from this place. I called to order for delivery and because I was over the 2 mile mark they wanted to charge me a $10 delivery charge. WTF! So if I lived by PS 207 which is the 2 mile mark, I can get delivery for $2, but because I'm at 164th Avenue its $10.If it wasn't for my wife insisting on wanting the burger and then going to pick it up I would have cancelled the order. It's a shame. I could understand adding a charge if it was going to broad channel, you have to go over the bridge and it is significantly further away as far as delivers go, but not $10. It is doubtful I'll order from here again. I'm truly disappointed!",I've been here approx 10 times already. Their chicken quesadilla is the BEST QUESADILLA IN NY. No joke. Their burgers are great! I consider the ceasar salad dressing is a lil strong... and to add chicken to the salad costs $5 bucks. Too expensive for an add on. Sundays 12 to 4pm???? You guys should open earlier on Sundays... Make sure you post your holidays hours on social media. It can save us all a trip. I am one of your most loyal customers and all I want is this business to stay strong. I always recommend this place to friends and family. The employees are always polite and helpful. Pls keep floors and tables clean at all times :),All I can say is WOW! I seriously cannot believe a place like this exist in Queens. My gf and I were very impressed with the menu selections that it was so hard to choose. We started off with shrimp appetizer and it was fried beautifully paired with an amazing sauce. Our entree is what stole the show. My girlfriend had the fried chicken sandwich which was not only fried very well but seasoned great and paired with a fresh slaw and truffle fries. I had the burger which was juicy and flavorful. The bun made the big difference in the burger. From the warm welcome to the consistent stellar service we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will be there more often!Great Job Local Press!,"The customers service at this place is wonderful. The server was polite and helped us answer some menu questions. They were playing the best jams (90s hip hop) and the place was spotless! I was rather disappointed with the food. From reading the reviews I was expecting more. Unfortunately, the food was bland and had no real ""omg yum"" moments. The ""garlic monkey bread"" was a hot dog bun pressed flat with the fixings. The bread tasted like it was on the verge of going bad and the pull apart was this stale bun cut up in 6 pieces. I ordered the cubano and it looked nothing like the pictures on this yelp site. Again, the cubano was in a stale hotdog bun pressed and cut in half. With a sandwich like that, it's crucial to have the right bread to make sure the juices from the meat don't soak up in the bread making it too soggy. In minutes I couldn't eat the other half because of exactly that. I will say my sister's spicy chicken sandwich was pretty good and their chicken wings are",The Local Press
187,"I thought this was authentic Japanese ramen-ya as they have many authentic Japanese owner-chef restaurants in Brookly, Queens, and of course in Manhattan....   Well, this was a Thai-Japanese ramen restaurant but the service and environment was below expectations based on all the Yelp reviews.   On the hottest day of this year, their additional A/C was not working so only central air was working but it was not turned on high so the room temperture was running high 70's.....     I asked them to see if they can blow the A/C but no response as I think they want to save electricity bill or something so we were sweating most of the time.   We ordered Gyoza, Chicken Karage, and Squid Fry (Geso-Age) but for the first time in years, my family and I could not finish due to the poor quality as they used old oil to fry Chicken and Squid but also their home made Gyoza was oily and not so fresh (maybe they use all the frozen home made Gyoza)....  HinoMaru house ramen was ok but it was too much Thai style Japanese ramen.   Overall the service was poor and due to the indoor high temp weather or something, the squid was very fish.    I wanted to go to this ramen place as my ""go to"" ramen as I just moved in this area but I will have to find another ramen-ya or go back to Long Island City or Queens....",try the spicy miso ramen !-some people might find the wood chairs with no back support an uncomfortable dinning experience-,"If you stop serving people at 10:00pm, it means you close at 10:00pm. False advertising. Please list your closing time at 10:00pm and not 10:30pm. We came at 10:01 and they refused to serve us. Insane. Will not be coming back ever.","Man, I stayed right around here in during cold winter NY (right by that time the blizzard was happening.) This was along the walk to the Ditmars station and I've been scouting around for restaurants near my place too. I'm glad I came here (solo dolo) to try this place. Ramen, broth, toppings, were all top notch flavor with great service as well.","Absolute deliciousness!!! Bowls full of flavor with a right amount of kick. So far we had Spicy miso vegetarian, Premium Soy Vegetarian, and The HinoMaru (NY Style). Liked them all! Service is nice and attentive. They have outdoor/ sidewalk sitting, but street parking. They are located relatively close to the subway, if coming from the city. One of the better places in Astoria!Solid 4.5*!","Very decent ramen. If you're in the area and in the mood, it's great to stop by here. Ramen is hard to come by in these parts. I like to go on a rainy day or later in the evening on a summer night to sit outside in the front patio on the busy avenue of Ditmars. Service has always been great.",HinoMaru Ramen
188,Came here for a party. First of all - hands down the best service ever. Food was really very average and not appropriately served.  It was buffet style but they ran out outer the few few people went up so we all stood there waiting for them to prepare more.  Chicken Marsala - meat was really rubbery and tough to cut - then I was horrified to find out it was veal.,Can't miss on the mussels for appetizer and any Italian dish on the menu. Old school Italian.,Brought my dad here for his birthday and I hated the food and the prices are ridiculous for how bad their food is. STAY AWAY. There are so many better Italian places worth half this price. The octopus appetizers were not even hot. No flavor and I couldn't eat it when it was almost room temperature.My fish filet with shrimp was lacking shrimp!!!! There is just no appeal to this place and it wasn't even a fourth full... So disappointed. It was such a waste of money but I had to keep a smile on for pops. I will never come here again.,Absolutely delicious food at this old school Italian restaurant. The Fuzzi Grappa is on another level. Amazing !!  Specials here are usually excellent. Service is always great not rushed. If you like bourbon and scotch they have some really hard to find bottles. The gnocchi dish I had with short rib was delicious. The gnocchi are pillow soft and melt in your mouth . My wife had the shrimp scampi and she loved it.,"Was there for a birthday party. The waiter, an older Italian man, decided to embarrass me when I called him over to ask about options since I am allergic to fish. He was very condescending and made it seem like I was dumb.. he had the table laughing at me, I think he was trying to be funny, but I don't like to be made to feel stupid, especially when he was the one who was being rude. If I had been there just for dinner- I would've walked out. But since I was there for a friends bday I had to stay.I will never go back here. Not after being treated like that.","Absolutely perfect starting with a pleasant waiter, delicious food, nice atmosphere.  I requested meat raviolli in meat sauce - something that is not on their menu, and they made it for me!  The veal was fantastic also!I live about an hour away but visit this place whenever I have to drop off or pick up someone at nearby Laguardia Airport.",Piccola Venezia Restaurant
189,Nothing great about these burgers .Very small burgers for the price .HOT CHIC burger ain't nothing spicy .Triple Bee burger had horrible expired cheese on it .Mix fries were horrible and had only four pieces of sweet potato fries in  them .I won't be returning to this place,Horrible experience! Threw out half the food because no flavor and ended up getting Food Poisoning. Will be calling Health Department in the Morning!,"Great food, but the customer service is not so great. Highly recommend to owners that staff receive a retraining in how to interact with customers.",Using peanut oil instead of soybean oil Gives you a 5 star rating !!! Fried pickles !! potato buns !!! Excellent food excellent service.,"I was so excited to try the food here, and I wasn't disappointed! I went in last week and ordered the Oklahoma burger, Lunatic burger and the mixed fries for takeout. The service was great, the decor and overall vibe is much appreciated in the area and wait time was minimal. Extra points for packing everything so neatly. The burgers were wrapped and then boxed making everything still neat and appetizing by the time we got home. The Lunatic burger was absolutely delicious as was the Oklahoma and the mixed fries were crispy and well seasoned. The burgers were definitely overcooked and dry but I still appreciate an overall great experience. I'll definitely be back!","Overall 3 stars but 1 more for being HALAL AND ORGANIC! Wifey & I stepped in on a thursday afternoon to grav late lunch. Place is a small corner brightly lit storefront. Place is spacious and wasn't so busy. There was no aroma of delicious burger patties or fried anything, just smoke from the open kitchen layout. We ordered :Lunatic burger Oklahoma burgerSweet potato friesVanilla milkshake Everything looked yummy, but unfortunately looks were deceiving. The lunatic had adequate level of spice and packed with toppings. The Oklahoma burger wasn't anything special. Both burger patties were on the dryer side. The fries were nicely done, not too greasy - crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Milkshake wasn't overly sweet or thick and enjoyable. Their concept is a copy of Shake Shack.Although their presentation is well, their delivery of delicious savory burgers are nowhere near Shake Shack's. Nice try though Halalbee's.",Halalbee's
190,"Went there, ordered chicken and waffles.  They put onions on it.  Who the hello puts onions on chicken and waffles?  So after I went through and picked them all off.  I go to put butter on the waffles and they have onions mixed into the butter.  What the hell.  And then I realize the chicken has bones. I usually like to cut a piece of chicken and waffle for one bite, but that's hard if the chicken has bones.  So I couldn't eat the chicken with the waffles.  I have to eat it with my hands which sucks because it's covered in syrup.","LIC has unfortunately turned into our own, in a really bad way Hipster wanna be Brooklyn scene.  You know the ones....nobody is from here, they wear sunglasses inside, iron their jeans for brunch and shop at whole foods. With that opening statement...Jackson's popped up during a recent search for something close by and with my girl always willing to try somewhere new we decided to give it a try. I knew LIC was developing but this place has built an entire mini city within ten years. As my girl knows all too well, I go out of my way to avoid crowds....the noise, waiting to order, lines for the bathroom...blah blah blah.What should have been a quick ride turned out to be a lot longer and waaaaay more expensive Uber ride than I anticipated.

Fool me twice, shame on me. After a very bad experience the first time we went (service and food were really bad), we tried to go again for brunch with our kids. We made a reservation via opentable.

When I asked what the point was of making a reservation--she snapped ""Im busy--do you want to wait or not?""",What a nice place and great food. I've come here twice for dinner and the food did not disappoint. The ambiance of the place is very chill and the music (Mostly Motown) is perfect in choice and volume (hate places where they pump up the music). Staff was courteous and prompt. We came at hours when they weren't crowded so we had their attention when needed. So that worked out. Great comfort food here. Drinks could be a little stronger but everything ranged from good to great here. It's a hidden gem just off the 7 Train station. Heard about their brunch and can't wait to try it out.,This is hands down the best brunch I have had in quite a long time. The brunch burger was juicy and flavorful. My mom had the chicken and waffles and she could not stop raving about it. The service was great. The waitress was very nice and the guy who sat us down(not sure if he's the owner) was also great. I would recommend this place to anybody.,"Great modern comfort food without going over the top. From Budweiser to Japanese scotch. Thoughtful  wine list as well.  A mellow restaurant/bar on the off nights. A bit busy during the weekends. Though not overtly loud. They offer appetizers, moderate mids, and entrees. The food is always consistent and service is well respected. Show up on a Wednesday night and ask about the special. You'll love it.",Jackson's Eatery | Bar

A good taste of potatoes and I think it's cream. Thickness of the soup was balanced.  Probably needing of salt if one is used to the salty food but for me this was perfect.When the entre was served, I found the steak I've ordered medium rare was dryer then Sahara in Africa. I send it back. The new steak came out from kitchen and it was raw with blood sipping out from it.I didn't touch it and asked for the bill and paid without even getting to the dessert that was in the fixed menu (they charge for the whole menu) since I lost my appetite.Maybe I choosed the wrong dish to begin with, big mistake to choose steak.",Good food but.

For entrees we got the lobster ravioli and the filet de sol. My oh my, my risotto was cooked perfectly and tasted sooo good. I could have honestly licked the plate clean.  The lobster ravioli was very delicious as well. The portion was a tad small, but the flavor was spot on. I'll be back to try out their pre fixe lunch/dinner menu.

Now for the good stuff:  roasted chicken with veg and mashed potatoes was perfect. Crispy and moist with yummy gravy.  Hangar steak with veg and frites was cooked just as I asked (medium rare) and was soft and flavorful. Hubby had veal chop au poivre that was a nice size and cooked medium and he liked it a lot. Apple tart was really really good. Warm with ice cream on top. $123 with tax for 4 people. Great deal.

She had on what must of been a toddlers shirt that exposed ALL of her cleavage. Totally inappropriate and unprofessional. There was a solo live musician and after he went off they allowed a group of intoxicated adult to get on the microphone yelling and singing off beat. It was horrible! Two hours and a migraine later I was glad to finally be out if there. The food took so long we had to cancel it. The sangria tasted like watered down cranberry juice mixed w cheap wine. Yuck.

I've waited for over an hour for my food and she never out the order in. On top of that she even put the correct order in. Needed a refill she was no where in sight. Dont go here especially if you're hangry.","I've never stepped foot into the restaurant but I've ordered multiple times from here. This was my backup restaurant when El Castillo De Pollo didn't pick up their phone. My go-to items consist of Chicharrones De Pollo, Pollo Tu Casa, Tu Casa Combo, Pollo Guisado, Tostones, Maduros, Yuca Frita, Frijoles, Papas Fritas, Yellow Arroz, Arroz Moro, Yuca Hervida, Agucate, Chicken Empanada, and Tu Casa Green Sauce. The first time I tried the food here I wasn't a fan because I was comparing it to my favorite dish Chicharrones De Pollo from El Castillo Del Pollo. Although I'm not a fan of the black beans or the chicken empanada I'm so happy I gave this place another chance. Everything else that I've ordered has been delicious and made with love. They include a few small to-go containers of the Tu Casa Green Sauce with each meal so be sure to use it. It's delicious, slightly spicy and goes great on the rice, the chicken, and Yuca Frita. Trust me you won't be disappointed.","I ordered delivery through GrubHub: half chicken with rice and beans and the small parihuela seafood soup. The food was decent, but their delivery could have been better. Their online menus are poorly written. I was thinking about getting wings, but they don't tell you how many wings they'd give you. I kind of wanted empanadas, which they list on their website, but their GrubHub menu doesn't have them. There were a few other items that were confusing. The food arrived 45 minutes early, and they didn't pack any utensils or napkins. They did pack two small containers of green sauce. The soup was nice. There was calamari, two shrimp, one mussel, and two types of fish. $12 for a small soup is pricey, but I suppose it was worth it. The chicken was OK. Sort of dry. Went well with the green sauce though. The rice and beans were good. Tu Casa's probably better as a dine-in restaurant.","I heard a lot about this place and their sangria. Since I was in the neighborhood I figured i would give it a try. I ordered the Margarita to start off and the rotisserie chicken with rice and beans lunch special. The chicken was ok but the spicy green sauce that was in the table gave it that extra kick that I felt was missing. The food other than that was good and flavorful. The Margarita was amazing, I forgot to tell the waiter no salt on the rim but other than that it was fantastic. To end my visit I ordered thief famous red sangria and to my surprise it was soooo good !!! I really liked this place. The staff was friendly and attentive and with their food being good I will definitely come back to this restaurant.",Tu Casa Restaurant
193,"The quality of food was satisfactory.

The servers wouldn't take the bill because the tip was ""too low"". Despite giving them a 10% tip , they complained and demanded that it must be at least 15%. On the receipt, there was a section for custom tip but they wouldn't accept it. They looked at the receipt and said, ""The other table next to you tipped at least 15%"" It wasn't even just one server, but three servers came together to complain and they were being extremely rude.

Hire better servers and maybe you won't have other posts complaining about your service too.","I reallllllly wanted to like this place but the service was extremely bad.

I was really confused as to why they did this... prior to this, someone at the table asked for a cup of ice and they gave us a bucket of ice, with no cups. At this point we were like how stupid are these employees that they lacked the common sense to provide cups if they were giving a bucket of ice. I assure you there were no language barriers either. I cannot for the life of it think of any excuses for them. Moving on to the food, we were already annoyed with how everything started so we didn't order many items. We did however order the huge beef platter that basically takes over the wholeeeeee table. I've seen this beef platter all over social media and heard so many good things about this place, but again I was really disappointed. While the beef had good marbling, I think they sliced it too thick because when we cooked it, it was quite chewy. We have been to hot pot several times, so if you though maybe we just over cooked the beef, well we didn't. Save your time and just visit spring shabu down the block.","Wow! Honestly, I'm surprised by how fresh all the ingredients were! I got the beef and lamb platter but specially asked for all beef (+$4) since I don't eat lamb and to my surprise, the meat tasted soooo fresh!! You can even tell it wasn't supermarket quality, where it's been frozen and defrosted a million times. I also ordered lots of vegetables and mushrooms which tasted fresh as well. *Must try bamboo fungus and fried tofu skin rolls!!! Both of those soak up the broth and taste amazing. Most definitely recommend. (You do have to pay for the sauce and fruit bar if you want any of the items there)","Broth was fantastic. Tomato broth was pretty hearty and tomatoey . Only thing I didn't like was how they had you stand by the hostess desk and order your soup base there. Atleast let the patron sit down first and order at their pace, no need to rush.Food seemed pretty fresh, by all means was not cheap, but decently priced.Overall pretty good, would recommend.",Fresh food enough to eat! Servers were running around busy and presentation was so great. Please check out my images.Strad -Flushing New York-,Liuyishou Hotpot
194,Special place. Authentic Italian food and hospitality. Very knowledgeable and attentive staff and some dishes you won't find anywhere else.,"It doesn't matter what style of pizza you prefer, this is the best pizza in Sunnyside right now. Nothing across the street, or down the block comes close to  how freaking delicious these pies are. If you haven't been, or are in the area, you need Sotto le Stelle in your life.","Just left.  Not happy with the menu changes.  The Orecchiette was my go to dish and is no longer on the menu.   I tried the Porchetta,  and was not impressed.   Still only dropping a star because the frito misto, and pizzas are still phenomenal.   I just don't understand why a successful place changes the menu.  If it ain't broken, don't fix it.","My husband and I went here for dinner. It caught our attention bec there was a little line outside. We put our names down and we had to wait for like 10-20min. The ambience is upbeat, loud and tight - very NY. The food was great! We shared a pizza and pasta. We would def come back again.","What is that huge portion of food!! We had the opportunity to come here with a large group of 12 and our phone just filled up with amazing looking dishes. I was first here around 7pm and the place is still manageable with no wait on the line. Took advantage of the 3 minutes left on the happy hour (ends a 7pm), I ordered a wine. Let's say I would go for the beer next time. Finally our party arrived about 20 minutes late and the owners are super cool about it. I wouldn't say the same for other people waiting outside thou. We took up about half the restaurant. Ordering took a while since the big group but our appetizers came pretty fast. I love the calamari and the optional bread. See the picture as I don't remember what else. My entree however is their pizza burger. Took a lot of convincing, I ordered it. The waiter helped with the wording and selling as well. It's huge to start with. Wrap in a pizza dough and a little disappointed thou. first they don't have mustard  at the restaurant and the meat is a little bit under seasoned. Overall it's okie with the added cheese and veggie. .To be honest, I can share my entree with two other people. For the price it is worth it.","I love this restaurant the staff is amazing, cute and welcoming people.The food is superb. Really well cooked and tasty.Drinks gosh I loved the Prosecco Sangria!The decorations and ambience is incredible.The staff run the business so smoothly and they are so nice that you feel part of the place.Thank you I loved the experience and I'll be back!",Sotto Le Stelle
195,My husband and I went to Italy this year so we have been looking for an authentic Italian Resturant for a few months now. We found this gem on Yelp. This place is a little piece of Italy in NY. We couldn't be happier.  The service was outstanding and the food was mouth watering.,Eh. I was a little disappointed by the very small portions and the many flies that were buzzing around inside. It took a little while for our food to come out too. The service was nothing special. The food itself was delicious. We were given complementary bread with a nice spicy olive oil to go with it. We liked that a lot. I probably would not come back though. There wasn't enough of a wow factor for me.,"I was really looking forward to coming here with all the other reviews so it makes me upset to have to write something negative, but I really didn't enjoy my experience here.My boyfriend and I came here for Valentine's Day. We were told that the only available options were a fixed menu for $68 a person. Immediately we were seated next to a couple who was visibly ordering things off the regular menu and being accommodated. When the waiter came to our table, we were told explicitly that we could only order off the fixed menu. Looking around us, other tables were served outside of the fixed menu as well.Unfortunately things didn't get better from there. The service was very inattentive. Yes, it was busy but the restaurant is small. We had to ask for water and for bread, though other tables who arrived after us were serviced, which was incredibly awkward. We enjoyed the appetizer immensely, and both ordered the filet mignon. It was a while between courses. I ordered my filet medium, but when I cut into it it was visibly well done. It wasn't that warm so it's likely it has been sitting there and cooked more as a result. My boyfriend did receive his medium as requested. We also had to ask for steak knives because those weren't provided.Dessert was extremely lackluster. They offered dessert for 2, melted chocolate fondue, but the portion was extremely small, and yet we were only allowed one. (So in essence part of the $68 was for half dessert). The melted chocolate also came out cold so it was likely sitting in the kitchen like the steak. The selection of dessert that came with the chocolate was a handful of berries and some cookies. It was sparse and not a great end to the meal.I'm so disappointed. I wanted to like this place but I don't think I'll be coming back.",I'm very surprised!! I was very hungry  and I can't wait to try the pasta . Now I know for sure where to eat pasta  And the Waiter (Oscar)was very friendly .Highly recommend this place.,"My husband and I have become regular visitors to Vite Vinosteria (and were big fans of their now closed sister joint, Vite Bar). Literally every meal we have here is consistently delicious. For our anniversary dinner a few weeks ago, we shared mussels with crispy proscuitto, ravioli al limone, and the most delicious short rib arancini you can imagine. We also had a beautiful and reasonably priced bottle of Chianti, and were treated to a complimentary limoncello at the end of our meal.Back in the fall, we had the absolute best risotto of our lives with a heap of shaved black truffles. I still think about it. I also love the bolognese.I have one very tiny complaint - you can either get a meat plate, or a cheese plate (pricey). Not both. I would love for them to give the option of a meat and cheese plate, as that is something we really enjoy with a nice glass of wine.The service is always excellent, the ambiance is wonderful (especially when you can sit outside!), and the food is authentic and beautifully prepared. It is not cheap, but you get what you pay for in this case - gorgeous, delicious food.",Always enjoy dinner here. Their special appetizer of mussels with fried prosciutto was delicious and huge! My husband had the steak - medium rare exactly and I had clam linguine. Wine was fabulous too. Have been back here about 4 times. By ourselves and with small groups. Each time everyone has been very happy.,Vite Vinosteria
196,Good Italian food but they change prices on the fly. I've ordered the same items with the same weight and get different pricing all the time.,"I WAS a daily customer and sent numerous family and friends here. I bought a container of potato salad and my nephew found 2 pieces of metal in it once it was already in his mouth. When I told the owners son, he was apologetic although he didn't offer for my purchase that day to be on the house after hearing about my nephew. Today, I brought the metal in and the owner called me a liar. Absolutely disgusting.",They aim to please and the price is right.  Maybe we just aren't used to the local cuisine but the tuna salad was swimming in mayo and the mushrooms were canned.  The eggplant hero was dry with no tomato sauce or cheese. I hate to be the only reviewer not giving them 5 stars but it wasn't close to 5 stars in my book.,"Wowz. I didn't even realize this was a five stars deli when I came here on a Wednesday afternoon. I can see why it is now!There isn't a parking lot dedicated to the deli. However, there is metered parking in the front and residential parking around the corner of the deli.If there isn't a line inside the restaurant, you can probably get a sandwich in-and-out within 10-15minutes. Once you walk-in, you will be greeted by a server who will take and make your order. During this particular visit, I ordered a Tony's Special with Fresh Mozzarella on a hero with a little vinaigrette. It is definitely better than ""regular"" mozzarella but I feel like you get more meat when you do order it with ""regular"" mozzarella. Tony's Special was something off the menu, that runs around $10. It is worth trying because of how fresh, clean, and simple around the mixture of meat, cheese, and bread. If you ever need a great sandwich, I recommend you to stop by Tony's for some of Tony's Special. Btw, they accept cash only but an ATM machine is available.","Yesterday I picked up a chicken cutlet hero with fresh Mozzarella, lettuce, tomatoes and balsamic vinegar on the side. I had the other half today and what I'll say is forget Cherry Valley and Christine's Tony's sandwiches are better especially the chicken cutlets. I'll have to try the panini's and some of their hot dishes they serve. Tommy and the rest of the staff provide great service and get your order the way you like it. This deli is the best around. The Polito family does a great job with their business, they're great hospitality people and satisfy you with everything to your liking. I've never had something from Tony's that I didn't like.","Yesterday I picked up a chicken cutlet hero with fresh Mozzarella, lettuce, tomatoes and balsamic vinegar on the side.

197,"Ate here before around the grand opening time. I had no complaints food was good the drinks were weak and the prices were cheaper compared to other diners. Now my second experience was nothing like the first. I ordered a western omelet  with no ham and what was brought out was a 2 egg brown omelet. I cook both at home and professionally so I know all about portion sizes and that wasn't it. I also ordered a quesadilla and it was just ok. The prices on the food has increased they took off the happy hour but capped all the drinks at a $10 price point. The only problem is when my drink the chocolate monkey came there was at most half an ounce to an ounce of liquor in my drink. Smh sooo weak. To top this off when the bill came my conniving server had the nerve to add 16% gratuity on a check to a table of 2 at 2:00 pm in the afternoon. Tip for the server, you get taxed when someone leaves a tip on a card. Cold hard cash is always better to leave with moron.","The Ozone Diner is located in a lovely little shopping plaza with a decent sized parking lot. I've been here twice and I was satisfied with my meal on both occasions. They have a wide array of selections; from breakfast to dinner and also wonderful desserts. However, breakfast seems to be their forte in my book. I've had an omelette with spinach, mushroom, and onions and a garden omelette with cheddar; they were both delicious. The omelettes come with a side of home fries but their was nothing special about them. On both occasions I was here the service was terrible. They never checked on me, rarely refilled my water, and they were just hard to get a hold of in general. During my last visit the waiter forgot to bring out the French toast I ordered. Thankfully they offer 10% off with a yelp check-in which is a nice little bandaid for not so good service I suppose.","I'm just leaving this place and I am so annoyed. For 2 people it was $45.00 my Mr. had the fish grits and eggs and I had hot wings. 2 sodas yup only that for $45.00. Let's start with the experience when we first arrived a lady greeted us at the door we were the first ones there. She was extremely pleasant which is why the 2 stars. Our waitress come a totally different experience. We were ready to order so she came back about 3 times when we were finally ready I asked if they had fried fish which I didn't see on the menu she said yea. Then proceeded to ask me how I like my eggs I told her I didn't want eggs she was like it's a combo. I asked can I have fried fish on the side, the answer was no. My Mr. order the combo, so I asked can he have extra fish, the answer was no. At this point I'm annoyed because if I'm paying for something why can't I have it. I settled with the wings no fries just wings. We get our food, looks good I'm still a little disappointed about the fish. I took a piece of my MR. Fish and I am happy I didn't order it, it was gross tasted like fish sticks. The chicken was okay until I looked in it and it was fatty mess. The fish went untouched and my Mr. ask can he swap out for something else, you guessed the answer was no, even if we didn't like the food we will still have to pay and also pay for whatever we would want to swap it out for so we opted not to. I've attached pictures. For 2 people gratuity was already included never saw that before esp when it was only 2 people and she didn't deserve $5.50, on top of gratuity it was a service charge as well. I was over it at this time a complete waste of money and leaving still hungry and unsatisfied with the service we received. Never will I come here again. It was worth a try. The lady that's at the front is the only reason it's a 2 star",Pretty good diner! Their chicken and fries are very good! I definitely recommend going to The Ozone Diner!,"My date and I, both had chicken sandwiches; there's a separate section. Mine was a grilled chicken breast, cheddar cheese, and bacon on a Garlic bread roll. AH-mazing! I ordered with tatter tots, because why the heck not? Everything was cooked to perfection. Companion had a breaded chicken, mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce on hero bread. Also very delicious, also it came with Onion Rings!!! The staff was extremely attentive and welcoming. I've been to Ozone several times and it NEVER disappoints! The pancakes are AMAZING. And all of their special sandwiches are great. I can't remember off the top of my head what I've had before but any sandwich in the garlic bread roll is FANTASTIC. There is also a French toast bread sandwich with Ham or Turkey meat, I can't remember the name but I know it was fantastic. It's my first time checking in and reviewing but I've visited many times before. The food is always amazing!!!!!","My coworker talks about this diner all the time and I was finally able to check it out for breakfast. My mom and I stopped by one weekday and I was surprised that it was crowded. I loved the decor and the fact that it was clean,  especially the bathrooms. I ordered,  fried eggs with cheese,  sausages, home fries with toast and had no complaints.  My mom ordered an omelet with grits and she wasn't too pleased.  She said her food was bland.  She tried to spruce up the grits to no avail. I enjoyed my meal and cleaned the plate,  lol. The staff were very friendly and you definitely get a cool and laid back vibe here.   I would return and check out some other menu items.",The Ozone Diner
198,"Awful place. Please do not go here and save your money. Its overpriced for average food. Octopus salad is $19, they give you few tiny pieces and cherry tomatoes. Fish was 27 and barely anything special, they put in eggplant with it. Sorbet for dessert wasn't warm like sorbet should be.Worst part the bill comes we leave a tip and they changed the tip as we were charged extra than what we paid. One of the worst restaurant experiences we have had.","I'll keep this short and sweet. I never go out for Italian food because my dad is fresh off the boat from Italy and he used to own restaurants there so nothing tops his food in my eyes. But if you're looking for food that is not only delicious, but also authentic, this is definitely the place to go. I don't remember the exact names of what I ordered but I know that one of their appetizers made of artichokes, shrimp and parmigiano is absolutely delicious. As an entrée I've gotten several of their pastas: one with salmon and one with shrimp and zucchini I believe. Absolutely delicious. Cooked al dente too. I've also gotten their ""seafood stew"" in a tomato sauce. It comes with a nice bread to dip and it is out of this world. I've already come here several times and I've had absolutely no complaints. I recommend getting a reservation as this place is usually packed.","I placed an order on seamless and went into the restaurant to pick it up and they said they have no order for me. They said they don't even work with seamless. But what bothered me most was that the guy was rude about it and didn't even offer to make it anyway, considering I came all the way there! I like their food but they could improve on customer service.",Food is just perfect.  Some restaurants have 1 or more ingredients overpowering.  All the dishes here were balanced and harmonizing with each other.  The waiters are very friendly and felt their attitudes were genuine.,"Came here to celebrate a birthday dinner and we were seated right away on a weekday around 8pm.Food: - Bread - warm, fresh, soft with a nice crust, and came with a dish of lentils with olive oil (dip not to my liking, but I enjoyed the bread nonetheless) - Calamari ($13) - came with marinara sauce, a creamy white sauce, and a piece of lemon. It was cooked well and the breading wasn't too heavy. Not better than the standard, but tasted great with the accompanying sauces - Pastas: 1. Tagliolino del Poeta - I recommend this dish. It was flavorful and delicious, but a small portion 2. Linguine con Scampi, Zucchine, Aglio, Olio e Peperoncino - biggest portion, shrimp and zucchini were perfectly cooked, noodles had less flavor compared to the other pastas we ordered 3. Spaghetti alla Sebastiano - basic homemade pasta with tomato sauce Things to know: - Street parking wasn't too hard to find on a weekday evening - Chef Mario personally comes out to ask how the food is, which is always a personable thing to do - Water refills are plentiful - The kitchen closes at 9:30pm- Dark lit interior, if you prefer that over brightly lit interiors (I found it a bit too dark for my taste)",Food here was so good. They provide quality bread at each table with oil and lentils to top. For dinner we got the salmon as well as the shrimp linguini. Both were absolutely delicious. Their drink menu is also very well topped.,Il Poeta
199,This place is okay. I came here. No one was here. The bartender was unfriendly. I needed food - so I stayed.The food was okay. The server never came over to take my drink order or ask how the food was. I told him I needed a few more minutes to figure out what I wanted to drink. But he never came back.I think the servers should be more attentive.,Had The Souther Fried Chicken & 2 Beef Tacos! OMG! Seriously A Hidden Gem In Sunnyside Queens!! And The Customer Service Was Def On Point!! Def Must Visit!!,"Love this place! Would go again for the Pat LaFrieda burger Cemita, or the fried chicken Cemita. I was excited to see corn on the menu but it didn't taste as good as it looked.",Went on a Sunday Morning @ 11:45. Not too crowded. Ordered an Elote and a Southern Fried Chicken Cemitas. Sandwich was pretty big and probably half would have been filling enough for lunch. Great taste and the chicken was very good.Will definitely be coming back here again.,My friend and I found this place by coincidence because I was just getting my nails done around the corner. The service was amazing! And the food to die for!!! My frozen margarita was a 4/10 Overall everything else was great!,"I love Cemitas. I've tried nearly everything, from simple chips and guac to their awesome fried chicken burrito. Nothing has ever left me disappointed. The only possible downside is that it gets really hot during the summer there, but that's not their fault. They open the front doors for the summertime vibes and I get that.Good service, great food every time. Not bad on prices, either.",Cemitas El Tigre
200,"I always start my review by saying, overpriced, just like every restaurant in America that WE allowed to happen since whatever a place charges and people pay for it, they'll keep raising prices.Food:  10+.  Service:  10+.  Atmosphere:  10+.  Portions:  Average size.  I wish restaurants would go back to serving some bread with a meal.  This place doesn't.Highly recommend.",This review is just for the service at the bar. I told the bartender that I wanted to start a tab and order food as soon as I walked up. He acknowledged me and took the orders of the people next to me first. I can understand. First come first served. Then he walks to the other end of the bar and doesn't come back to me for another 15+ minutes. I watched as everyone at the bar gets their drinks even the 2 dudes that just sat down next to me after 10 minutes of waiting. My patience was lost and I was on the brink of losing it before he finally acknowledged me and took my card and orders. Standing at the bar and waiting that long while being completely ignored without an apology even though I was trying my best to be polite and not be rude really really pissed me off. Sorry but I doubt I'll be coming back nor will I recommend any of my friends to come here. I was the only Asian guy at the bar. You seriously didn't see me??? Either get some more people behind the bar or teach them to get to everyone in a timely manner. He even changed the TV channel before he would get to me because that was obviously more important.,"So my Father-In-Law was visiting from Japan in June and I wanted to give him a different dining experience, so my wife and I decided to take him to Manor Oktoberfest. During our 1hr 45min stay, we ordered 3 rounds of drinks, we split 2 entrees, and when we were not quite full, we topped ourselves off with one their giant pretzels to snack on. After we finished the pretzel, each of us still had half a glass of beer left, when our waitress Stef (I'm guessing it's short for Stephanie/Stefanie) came around and asked if we wanted anything else, upon which I said ""we're good for now, thank you"" (meaning we could still order more food/drinks later, but we still had our current beers to finish). At that point, things went sour and downhill in the blink of an eye, as Stef decided to take it upon herself to let us feel very unwelcome. She told us since you're not ordering anything now, we'll need this other table you're using (they had squeezed together 2 SMALL sized tables to fit the 3 of us) and with a BIG attitude, she felt the need to add, ""I've fit 8-10 people where you're sitting at in the past, so you guys should have no problem squeezing in."" Then her and another waitresses swooped in and AGGRESSIVELY separated our tables and SLAMMED a plastic chair at one end. First off, we would've gladly squeezed in and given them the other table to use, but why did Stef and the other wait staff have to be so rude, and more importantly, why did she feel compelled to add such a nasty statement at the end. We'd been polite and kept the food and drinks coming during our stay, not once was there a lull where our table was empty. And yet she made us all feel like we were dirt, like we were ""table squatters"" who just ordered 1 round of beers and were ""hoarding"" the tables so other patrons could not be seated. Even my Father-In-Law picked up on the whole ""negative vibe"" and told us, ""I don't need anything else from here. We can go somewhere else."" At that point, I couldn't get the attention of any of the waitresses to get the check so I went up to the bar to settle our bill. While I was paying, I calmly told the the manager what we had been through, how it made us feel very unwelcome and he said he would talk to the waitress. I was turning to leave when Stef came back and asked if I had a problem with her service. I told her that what she had said and done made us feel very unwelcome and she could've been more professional. She then proceeded to SCREAM at both me and my wife and told us, ""what the heck is wrong with you guys, you could've came to me if you had a problem.""  Here I was trying to describe to her the situation and how us, AS CUSTOMERS, felt like we were TREATED POORLY. The whole time I was talking to her in a normal, even tone, but she kept on going with her ballistic screaming at the top of her lungs at us. She finally screamed, ""I won't apologize for my actions because I don't feel like I did anything wrong (evidently she needs a lesson in customer service, and she made it clear that she wasn't listening to me, even though she had asked me to tell her what she had did wrong in the 1st place) and then she ended it by waving her arms wildly and telling us ""to get the F*%K out, get out!!!!!!!!"" I'd also like to add, that not once during Stef's entire wild 5 min episode, did the manager look to step in (all while all the other patrons were watching in utter shock). I looked at the manager and told him, ""wow, this is the type of people that you have working here?!?!"" and we all left. I will never step foot in this restaurant again, EVERYONE SHOULD AVOID MANOR OKTOBERFEST, they are COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL!","Everything was top notch- the food, the service, the atmosphere were all wonderful. I can't wait to go back again. Highly recommended for amazing food and a great experience.","Holy Schnitzel !!!

I came here with my friend and his German grandmother when we mentioned we were in the mood for something German.We started off with beers at the bar. They have a great selection of German beers both in bottle and on tap. After getting a table, we ordered one of the giant pretzels for an app. The variety of mustards was great, and the pretzel was very soft but not overly doughy. I forgot what my friend and his grandmother got, but I got one wurst and one kassler rippchen for the entree, and ""Octoberized"" it at that (adding smoked bacon, sautéed mushrooms and onions). The wurst was a bit too puréed for my liking but otherwise tasted great, as did the potato au gratin side dish. The smoked bacon was outstanding, and the kassler rippchen (pork chop) wasn't dry and was full flavored.I'd love to come again if I'm ever in the neighborhood in the future.",Manor Oktoberfest
201,"We ordered food from this place. The food was tasteless, full of added colors. The curry was extremely watery. We ordered chicken tikka masala and paneer makhani. There were total of 4 pieces of chicken and 6 small paneer pieces. For the price the food is just not worth it.",The owner sent me a message after my poor experience and we've ordered several times since then without any problems. I guess everybody has a bad day once in awhile. Glad to still have my spot!,"This is insane. I've been ordering from this place for years, tonight I call them because it's been an hour and 20 minutes since we ordered and the guy tells me it's going to be 10-15 more minutes which would basically make it 11 PM. I tell him he should have called, he says they were busy, which doesn't mean that they can't call me, so I tell him just forget about it and he gets pissed off and hangs up on me. You've definitely lost me as a customer, and I used to send so many people to your place.","I've been back in Maspeth for a little while and have known about Spice Kitchen's existence for just as long. However, I never got around to ordering from them. Until now.I called to order for pickup around dinner time (5:00pm-6:00pm or so).Although it's not specifically on the menu, I asked if they could make chicken tikka masala (which is one of my favorite dishes ever) but with paneer (cubed cheese) instead of chicken, as I try to avoid meat on Mondays (Meatless Mondays). The gentleman that I spoke with said it would be fine. I also ordered saag paneer, as that, and palak paneer, is also a favorite of mine. And I topped it off with two naan - one plain and one garlic/onion.I was told 15 minutes before it was ready and that time was pretty spot on. I picked it up, the staffperson at the front desk was friendly and helpful. The total came to approximately 35 for the above, and included two small orders of basmati rice and a small cup of a rice pudding-esque dessert (coconut kheer, perhaps?).Everything was spectacular. I'm grateful it's about halfway from my home to my girlfriend's home. Even the next day, for lunch, everything reheated perfectly and was just as yummy. I even have another portion of tikka for tomorrow with some rice and half a naan. The portions are of a good size. The whole order was for two of us and we ate our fill. So, I would estimate that it was 5 portions total in the whole order of pickup. So, I would say it came to $8.00 per meal, since I left some tip from the pickup.I will definitely be coming back for eat-in and take out. I don't know if I can convince myself to try something different, because these two entrees were so yummy.I recommend checking them out and support the business if you like their food and service.","My boyfriend and I went for a late dinner and no one else was in there at the time, but we left more than satisfied. The chicken tikka appetizer we had burst with flavor, our eyes lit up when we both bit into the chicken and proceeded to devour the dish. He had lamb vindaloo curry and I had chicken korma. The vindaloo was pretty spicy for me but comfortable for him, but I had more because it was so savory and I'm a masochist. Loved my chicken korma as well, could really taste the sweetness and nutty flavor in the gravy. The strawberry lassi was also the perfect sweetness and consistency. Definitely a must-go-back to try their other dishes.They also do 10% cashback if you pay in cash, and they are still running a Groupon for 20% cashback on the first card payment and then 10% back on cc payments after the first. Even more reason to go back!",What can I say I love the food ! Perfect spice with hint of cilantro n cumin and taste of hot spices that goes so well. The only thing I wish it was even amount of chicken on the tikka but I still ordered again .,Spice Kitchen
202,"We went back a second time and wasn't disappointed. Although we have to say the waitress seemed a bit out of it, but the bartender made up for the service.","After reading all the great reviews my husband and I decided to try the lobster roll. The first red flag should have been they did not offer a choice between mayo or butter. The waitress explained it was a combination of the two. This, is a sin. Still, we apprehensively ordered them.Here's the bottom line: They were stale and chewy like it had been made days before. Not fresh.  They were also very small. Don't order them. You'll be very disappointed.This was the second time we went to this this reseand the second time we were very disappointed. We won't be back.","Used to live in the neighborhood and was looking forward to a return to Off the Hook. Unfortunately, our visit really missed the mark. Our server was either overwhelmed or brand new. She wasn't confident with the menu based on our ordering process.  She dropped another table's check at our table before we were even served drinks. Our drink order was taken to the wrong table. Food was brought to our table that wasn't ours.  There's so much more I could nitpick but those were the major issues. There were other guests visibly upset with service nearby so it didn't appear to be an isolated thing.  At the end of the day, we paid $130 for oysters that were either not completely shucked from the shell or ones that were mangled during opening and a 45 minute wait between oysters and entrees that was blamed on what I ordered (a skirt steak sandwich).I work as a restaurant manager. The worst thing a server can do is not take ownership of his or her mistakes and ignore the tables they've already mistreated. The only mention of our foods delay was when our server dropped the check. Way too little, way too late.","I have been craving raw oysters for the longest time and after months of these cravings, I finally decided to come here and give it a try since all the pictures looked so promising. Food was great- shrimp mofongo was a lot better than I expected since I'm not a big fan of plantains, mussels were good- just a littttleeee too salty, and oysters and clams hit the spot. We got two dozen of each during happy hour!My only issue was that they took FOREVER to serve our food. We placed an order for two dozen oysters and clams, clam chowder, mussels, and mofongo but had to wait about an hour just for the first dish to arrive and then probably another 30 minutes for everything else to arrive.  They forgot to put in our clam chowder order as well but we easily forgave since we were already stuffed from the oysters and didn't want to wait another hour.","My wife and I went for brunch this Sunday and had an inconsistent dining experience.The Good: the fried calamari and jerk chicken appetizers were amazing.  Both seasoned incredibly well and definitely worth a try.  I also really enjoyed the bloody Mary and would put it up there with any brunch cocktail I've tried.  After the pleasant round 1, we were looking forward to the main courses which were wholly disappointing.The bad:  After our appetizers we then were subjected to a 45 minute wait for a lobster roll and eggs Benedict.  When they did arrive my wife's lobster roll contained numerous shells and was very overcooked.  Her French fries were also inedible and overcooked.  My eggs Benedict was simply, with just the muffin, poached egg and lobster.  I would have been fine without the traditional hollandaise sauce and bacon/ham if prepared right.  However my lobster was also chewy and overcooked and the side of potatoes were also raw in the middle.  Since we had waited 45 minutes and didnt want to wait for a refire we just ate and paid.",Deceiving large space with a great little patio out back. Def recommend happy hour for 1 dollar oysters and cheap drinks.,Off The Hook Raw Bar & Grill
203,This place is so good! The food is very authentic! I saw people leaving review with 2 stars but they might expect something else they should not. Anyway definitely check this place out when you are in the hood. Written by a girl who moved here 3 years ago from Northern part of Chinab,This place is so good! The food is very authentic! I saw people leaving review with 2 stars but they might expect something else they should not. Anyway definitely check this place out when you are in hood. Written by a girl who moved here 3 years again from North part of China!,"Where do I begin? This place is terrible, first the chinks eat my own dog that I left outside on a leash attached to a pole and now they target my black daughter Shoebishwa, they fried her and used her as a new Asian special. I saw my god damn baby be turned into an Asian souffle. Damn Asians y'all haven't faced the wrath of this fat chubby ass balding weave looking 40 year old mother. To add to ma baby's pain this Thom kid just my kids corpse as a toilet bowl saying he prefers the Asian kids. What? Black kids ain't good enough for you? I hate this place, ma damn man will come beat ya ass into pulp. Asians be eating dogs and kids, what has this world come to? Ima take a fat shit in y'all's bathroom and not flush. I'll take my period blood and dye your damn chinky hair into red like ma baby's blood you slanty eyed two timing black hating, dog eating, shit stain yellow Asian folks.","Ordering remorse.Soup dumplings: excellent. Pumpkin cakes and Mao's pork shoulder--each recommended by Sam Sifton in the New York Times in 2011--were disappointing. Pumpkin cakes were mostly fried and sweet; the pork shoulder was incredibly fatty.Very kind service, including taking our reservation for two then holding it 20 minutes past our predicted time.I'll be back with more people and order more and better.",This place fell off big time on my most recent visit. It should have been a sign that they were pretty empty on a weekend evening.The kao ghu so pork shoulder I loved last time was devoid of actual meat. Lot of potatoes though. The free range chicken soup was nauseatingly greasy with heavy duty oils in a way only bad Chinese restaurants can achieve. Also very little actual meat just lots of bone. Some dishes were still good such as the suai le hon stir fried mustard tips. Portions for all the dishes seemed way smaller this time around.,"I've finally found a great Hunanese restaurant!!Hunan cuisine has a great tradition and is famous among Chinese for delicious, unique spicy flavor. It creates this flavor with the use of many fresh ingredients including garlic, peppers and shallots in comparison to Sichuan flavor which is more greasy and employs more dried preservatives such as sichuan peppercorns. I should know. My family is Hunanese. While driving around the city you see lots of signs of Hunan this and that, it seems all of those restaurants are just take-out places for the masses or Sichuan restaurants in disguise. Hunan Kitchen of Grand Sichuan is the real deal.Upon walking in on a recent Thursday evening, I noticed how very busy they were. Lots of customers, both Chinese and American, and even some Indian-looking folks. Young and old, families, attractive couples, etc. My cousin who is from the mainland and really knows her stuff did all the ordering. We skipped the typical (double cooked pork, ma po tofu, etc) and tried some more exotic dishes. The first dish was a knock out. Shao tsao hay shan yang (as it is pronounced) - black pepper stir fried lamb with red peppers and greens. It was probably the best lamb dish I've ever had. No pungency or overbearing meat smell at all but retaining all the deliciousness and tender taste of the lamb. Seasoned to perfection and of course goes great with rice. We then ordered pork shoulder sauteed on a crockpot of sorts, pronounced kao ghu so. Also very delicious if a bit heavier than some may like. It was very flavorful, cooked with potatoes and nuts and the meat was superbly tender. Definitely eat it with rice as it was quite spicy and salty. As my cousin explained, this is like a better version of double cooked pork. We also had shueh le hong (my botched pronounciation) - a stir fried veggie dish. Not sure what the vegetable used was unfortunately but at least I have captured the pronounciation for next time. It too was delicious but salty - that's why you have to eat it with rice. It had a spicy kick to it, which was nice. Not used to eating spicy veggie stir fry dishes that are this good. I know I would botch the attempts in my kitchen to give veggies a spicy flavor. Also we had a spicy fish dish- duo la ghao yu toe (pepper fish head). I think the type of fish used was carp. It was very tender with lots of meat and the spices gave it a nice flavor but I could still taste a bit of the fishiness underneath. Overall, it was a great meal. We fed a table of 5 adults with 2 beers ordered, and a decent amount of left-overs and the final cost was under $105 from what I remember. Not too bad.",Hunan Kitchen of Grand Sichuan
204,"I came with a Hispanic ex and they only spoke to him. I didn't mind until I asked a question and they turned to him and explained in Spanish for him to re-explain to me. After some awkward borderline rude service, they made us wait forever for our food (which was just okay), then hit us with 15% gratuity. Definitely a bad experience!The reviews about the workers slacking off and pretending nothing is wrong... yep, that's what happens with automatic tip.","I had dinner plans for a Friday, so I asked a coworker for a spot to visit in Queens, so I visited Mr. Dre's Kitchen Bar at his suggestion. The parking lot in the back is not for the restaurant, don't get towed.It's a pretty small spot, and it was pretty empty, besides an obnoxiously loud group near where we were seated. It reminds me of a garage for some reason. I found myself wondering why my coworker recommended this spot.The menu didn't look like anything special, typical mix of Latin American dishes. Turns out it was happy hour, which meant 2 for 1 drinks. We got a few mojitos and they were pretty strong. We got a fried meat platter as an appetizer and I got the pork chops. She didn't like it much cuz the majority of the menu was fried. I like fried food, but I found everything to be pretty average. The total bill for two entrees, an appetizer, and four drinks came out to $90, the tip automatically included. That is kinda ridiculous considering happy hour is 2 for 1 drinks. I'm also displeased that the gratuity was automatically added on a table of two. Eh, not sure if I wanna come back here.",We haven't been at the location in a little bit because the music is so loud (but it's good) but we all do order very often from Uber eats  - today was a very bad order - we ordered 4 burgers and only got 1 - the fries and the mozzarella sticks were so over fried- I just want to let you know because I love you guys and don't want to see you do poorly,Everything was great. Love my Dominican music too. Made me feel like I was in DR having a drink in my backyard. Awesome strong drinks too.,"I went to Mr. Dre's last Sunday with a few of my friends for the first time! I have been trying to get here for the past year and the stars finally lined up. I arrived by myself and started off with a beef chimi sandwich for brunch with French Fries. I washed that down with a few lagunitas IPA's before switching to henny sangrias. This is where my relaxing afternoon started to get crazy lol. My next surprise is that a hookah came out for another table! Now I was hooked and I couldn't leave . Hookah , a few refills and henny sangria I was there half the afternoon. The food was very good. The drinks were very good and above all , the owner and all of the staff were very nice people . If this wasn't enough for Sunday funday... I left for a few hours ran a few errands and returned for dinner ... the same day!!!!","This is a welcomed establishment in college point. Plays latin music, has over a dozen tvs showing sports etc.. Lights light up the night. Service is friendly, drinks look good but didn't have tonight. Got mozzarella sticks for my nephew (standard but good) and i ordered the Churasco everything was great. Will come back at night for the bar scene and Sunday for brunch",Mr. Dre's Kitchen Bar
205,The stuffed chicken wings is definitely my favorite. The place is very unique and abit dark but it provides the customers privacy. Korean Fried Chicken never fail to amaze me as each places have their own flavors,"Oh my jesus. I got the buddaejjigae, that was horrendous. Can you really served red chili flakes and water, there was no flavor. The base of a bbudaejjigae should taste like kimchi jjigae, but it was horrendous!! Gave it back to the kitchen, idk what they did but it was slightly more edible. Felt like i really wasted my money. It was one of those i shoulda not been lazy and made it at home myself feels... besides that the chicken is alway on point. I guess i learned my lesson of not getting anything else but chicken there....",Good Lord the food is good.     Point blank.  Go eat everything.   I literally don't know what else to say because yelp is making me write a longer review but since i must......THE FREAKING MAPLE BACON FRIES?!    *faints*,I love the stuffed chicken wings here at Debasaki! Especially the one with cheese corn. Every time I come with friends that would be their favorite out of all the flavors. I also really enjoy the chorizo fried rice but it does get pretty spicy! Their passion fruit cider is also really good and taste like juice. The ambience here is pretty dark and usually the music doesn't match the music video on the screens which I find funny  I would definitely continue coming here in the future because their stuffed chicken wings are so delicious! Also the service here is great and we usually get seated right away. There was one time that we had to wait about a hour with a large party with about 8 people.,"I have no idea why it took me so long to try this chicken spot out! I came with a friend for dinner to try out their famous gyoza-stuffed wings. I had a hard time imagining what a stuffed wing would taste like, but it was delicious!! We were both blown away by the first bite. We ordered the half/half combo of stuffed wings with the kimchi cheese and corn cheese flavor. My favorite of the two was the kimchi cheese, but I just love kimchi in general. We also ordered a pitcher of the yogurt soju slushie pitcher, which was really good. It wasn't too strong, which was great for me. The restaurant is strangely in a very secluded and somewhat shady area. The interior and ambiance, however, is perfect for a chimaek night with friends or for a date night. It was like entering a different world, it's very dim, but clean with large private booths. Overall, the food and service was great and I'd definitely come back to try their other flavors :)","I love coming back to this place! I've been here about 4-5 times in the past 3 years. It's a little out of the way from Central Flushing but definitely my favorite place for Korean fried chicken especially since they're stuffed!!!Every time I go, I order the maple bacon sweet potato fries, kimchi fried rice, army stew and the stuffed wings variety pack. I recently went with a group of 6 on a Saturday night around 8:30PM and it was surprisingly not busy, we were seated quickly.The food comes out as prepared so it's usually still fresh and steaming hot. The sweet potato fries are crispy with the maple glaze - we like picking them up with chopsticks ahha. The kimchi fried rice comes with a runny egg and cut up pieces of sausage - very flavorful slightly on the oily side though. Now for the showstopper: the stuffed wings!! My favorite is the kimchi stuffed and the spicy corn, but honestly the shrimp one is good too. The wings are perfectly shaped and stuffed that you can actually pick them up with your chopsticks if you don't want to touch them! They're usually hot so don't eat too fast. We also got a half and half combo with sweet soy garlic and crispy Cajun: as a table, we agreed the sweet soy garlic was better not to say the crispy Cajun was bad, we just liked the sweet glaze more.Other times, I've tried the army stew which is great complemented by a side of white rice to balance the spicy. If you're with a group of friends, consider ordering a pitcher of the yogurt soju drinks. Overall, I'd love to always stop by for my Korean student fried chicken fix here! If possible, I'd suggest making a reservation because I've waited previously, but given its unconventional location, you'll probably get seated right away on most occasions. Always a good meal, will definitely be coming again!",Debasaki
206,"My boyfriend and I went here a while back. The food was very bland. It needed way more flavor. I ordered the shrimp and pasta which needed some seasoning. My boyfriend ordered mussels and shrimp with pasta and felt it was just okay. I was really hungry because I was saving my belly for this dinner that night, however, I had to eat out of their bread basket for satiety.Service was fine. However, due to the lack of flavor in the food, I don't think I'll ever return.","I actually didn't even eat here. We called at a little after 9 to ask when the kitchen closed and were told 10. When we arrived at 9:21 I was told by the ""manager"" very rudely ""I need your order in 10 minutes"". I said we called and were told you closed at 10. He was like yea but I just need your order fast in 10 minutes. He was rude and flustered as if we were bothering him. I said nope and left. I'm not giving money for a family style restaurant if you can't even give basic customer service and act as if you don't want to be bothered. And supposedly this is the manager. No thanks.","I was expecting this place to be better.  I was disappointed.  We went here at about 3:30 for lunch. My bf knew exactly what he wanted, the lobster fra Diablo. I wasn't sure what to get,  but I wound up getting the shrimp scampi with vegetables and saffron rice.  We got a pitcher of Sangria. I'm glad we didn't order appetizers cause what we did order wound up being $80 & it wasn't worth it at all.The lobster fra diablo was watery, no sauce whatsoever,  a few pieces of lobster, calamari, clams,  mussels & shrimp. It sounded good but it just lacked flavor because the sauce was so watered down.  We asked for sauce on the side & it wasn't much better,  it was lukewarm and not spicy at all. My shrimp scampi was over cooked, cold and no flavor or sauce. The rice tasted like it came out of the box and the veggies were bland.Sangria was weak and the pitcher was full with ice.  My BF was so disappointed and he expressed this and the waitress just said ""oh sorry"" she didn't offer to get the manager for us or anything.  I ate less than 2 hours ago & I'm hungry. I wouldn't go back.","What more can I say, this place is a gem in hiding! The food was delicious. We had the calamari as an appetizer and it was light and crunchy.  Omg the Portuguese bread was so delicious!!!!For my main dish, I had the lamb chops, mashed potatoes, and spinach. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. My lamb was cooked medium. I didn't love the long stems in the spinach. My daughter ordered the chicken tenders and fries but she didn't like it at all. So I tasted it. I thought the chicken tenders were delicious and well seasoned. I did not like the French fries.She then ordered the chicken breast (I can't remember what it was called), with white rice and broccoli. She ate it all in record time lol. It was really delicious.My friend ordered the steak and lobster with saffron rice. Delicious!!! The steak was very tender and well seasoned. I preferred the saffron rice to the mashed potatoes. For dessert I got the cream and mashed shortbread cookies in a cup dish. It was okay. I'm not a dessert person but I figured I try something new. The ice cream was way better lolIn closing, I will definitely be back. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. The food was great. It took a little while to come out but it was well worth it. The ambience is nice and spacious.",Came here for lunch with my colleague a few times . The food quality is good . Lunch time is usually quiet . We ordered baked clams with spinach and octopus with garlic sauce . Both were good and fresh . My boss ordered monk fish seafood stew and the fish were really tender .The secret items from the menu is the grilled quails . They gave us the garlic and spicy sauces .Make sure you call beforehand to ask if they have any availability .,"This was an excellent dinner. I was visiting NYC for a short time and had dinner here. Good selection of seafood, excellent tase, and nice drinks. Will,come again on my next visit.",O Lavrador
207,"I understand you're busy but to call 5 times and taking 8 rings and then finally getting someone to then get hung up on, how do you expect to make money? I'll update my review if someone picks up the phone to take my order.",The food is great but the service sucks the owner need to hire more waitress (short of staff),Bad customer service and takes long to order also the food isn't that great NOT a place to enjoy with family,"This is the best Peruvian food I've ever had. Their green sauce is SPICY and it's amazing! We usually order an entire pint of green sauce whenever we stop by here. I put that shit on everything - burgers, sandwiches, leftovers, everything. I'm surprised pio pio is still in business when they're just 3 doors down. Maca beats pio pio hands down!","So my wife & I live just blocks from MACA, but have never been. Our friends have been bugging us forever to go..telling us it's not to be missed. Let me state...the food ( or what we were served)...a solid 8/9...but the experience......no more than a 5.So when we walked in..we were greeted cordially..seated right away...were given menus...etc...everything was fine. Within a few minutes, the waitress came back for our order...2 sangrias....empanadas and cerviche for appetizers, and chicken and maduras for main course. The sangria was delicious...heavy on the alcohol..and we all ready decided, we'd have a second, as soon as we tasted how good it was. Then the empanadas came..one beef. one cheese. the beef one was honestly one of the finest empanadas I had ever had, and the smokey sauce that accompanied....just divine. Then came the cerviche. YUMMY. Incredibly fresh fish....some wonderful citrus...and some yummy corn at the bottom. This was turning into an amazing dinner.But then it all STOPPED.......No one came immediately to clean our plates off the table.... no one came by to see if we wanted to refill our empty sangria glasses ( and we wanted more)..and no one seemed to be in any hurry to check on our chicken and maduras. After 5, 10 minutes...possibly longer...I was getting annoyed, and the waitress caught on. She came over to see what was wrong. Long story short..our madiras had been sitting on the counter for over 10 min..and the chicken was never ever ordered. At this point..we looked at the waitress...told her we had no interest in the chicken anymore...but perhaps we'd finish with 2 more sangrias. Well guess what happened.....nothing. Like I said...they were done serving us for the night. No sangria came...so 5 min later..we asked for a check. The waitress THEN decided to ask us...."" are you sure you dont want the chicken ? "" But never asked us about the second sangria, that she never served.Not sure I will ever go back...and not sure I can even reccommend this placeto others...but it's a real shame...cause it was one of the most promising starts to a meal that I have had in a long time...I just don't think I have the patience to be ignored again","I really liked this place a lot! I was in the mood for Peruvian cuisine and of course, Yelp helped me find this place. We found parking down the block which I'm surprised because it can be a little tricky in that area of Rego Park to find parking. As soon as we walk in, we were seated. The restaurant is quite small but they were able to fit my big family comfortably. They gave our kids a kids menu and plastic utensils, right away I knew we were going to be served by smart people with initiative. The service was great! The lady was very attentive and friendly with my kids. I started by ordering a glass of their sangria, which was great! Tasty, sweet, not too sweet and strong enough to give me a buzz before dinner, just what you need when you bring the kids to dinner with you lol We ordered half a chicken with fries for the kids. The chicken was delicious and moist. My husband and I ordered the Jalea with an order of Chaufa rice with shrimp. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS AND GONE WITHIN MINUTES!!! lol The seafood was fresh! The rice was moist, flavorful and had enough shrimp for both of us to enjoy and be satisfied with.The bill was even better, not too pricey! Will be back!",MACA Peruvian Restaurant
208,"If you want an authentic Guyanese fried rice with chicken in the rough, this is it ! I also tried the mutton curry... well let's just say I can't tell my mom I found one that rivals her's !","Hands down the BEST Caribbean food place to order from in queens!! Their jerk chicken is fire!! If you haven't tried this place yet, you are missing out big time!!","First time ordering from this establishment after hearing many positive things about their food. Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype I've been hearing about. I ordered 3 fried rice all which the rice was hard and inedible. My family threw it out after taking one bite. However, Rasta pasta was very tasty. When called to lodge a complaint, the manager (I assume) not too sure his name, was more than apologetic and issued a refund, that's my reason for the two stars instead of one.","Sooooo after being hungry all day, my friend and I decided to go on yelp and find somewhere new to eat. We probably ate everywhere in Brooklyn before. While searching we found this place and looked at the food pictures and determined this is where we wanted to go.  Upon arrival, we found parking immediately. That's a plus. We get inside the music is JAMMING. I'm a soca queen so this was perfect. The DJ was excellent! We got to pick a table and about 10 seconds later, we were greeted by Pinky. She is amazingggg. I've never had such good customer service in a restaurant. She was very personable and funny. Everything she recommended to try was slamming.   For appetizers, I had the buffalo wings (MAD GOOD) and my friend had the jerk chicken tacos (also mad good) . They were spicy as hell though so make sure you have something to drink. I also had the Rum punch.. cause you know I'm the rum punch queen too.  For Entrees, my friend and I both had the oxtail ramen! Immaculate! Okurrrr. So good. Oxtail was tender. Just perfect. I would definitely be back. Oh yea they had hookah too! Excellent.","Wifey & I walked in at 10 pm on a Tuesday night in August. Immediately welcomed with a greet and smile from bartender. We sat where we pleased and were a bit turned off by the sticky table tops. It's a small room but spacious, with 2-3 other patrons dining at the bar. Music level just right to hear each other without struggle and tunes have you move in your seat. We ordered :Ginger ale - came in mason jar/ice but asked for the can as some restaurants use the bar's dispensing ginger ale.Guava Juice - also came in mason jar w/2 cherries and ice. store bought but refreshingLamb sliders : came out first in 10 mins, potato buns not warm/toasted - only the patty was. Lamb patty done right, had crisp edges, was seasoned well, had Caribbean zing to it. Topped w/cheddar and possibly shredded mozzarella cheese melted. Accompanied by a spicy sauce - looks like pink sauce (ketchup/mayo) but it''s not. Spice lovers will appreciate level of spice. Rasta Pasta w/steak & shrimp - generous portion of Alfredo pasta topped with thinly sliced steak and plump shrimp. Seasoned and mixed well. Delicious and can be shared. Highly recommend.I've dined here a few times before and have yet to change me thoughts on the experience. Bottom line, this place has delicious food, friendly staff and leaves you feeling better than when you came in. But you'll pay a pretty penny for it ($3 for soda can, $+30 for pasta) hence why price to food ratio/taste is debatable; especially when you consider the location it currently is in, you wouldn't expect such prices. Then there's small things that remind you this place is a lounge (sticky floors, high bar stools/chairs, scratched furniture, etc.) It's about a 3.5 but giving it 4 because it's halal - or so the owner says it to be.","Home .. 1030pm, we're hungry. Start scrolling through UberEATS and see HEAT. I run to YELP to start my review reading, ITS A HIT! Check the pictures out, show my wife, and we decide ordering is NOT what we want to do. We get up, get dressed, & get in the car. Low key place. Not many people inside. We sit. PINKY comes right over and takes our order. Get straight to the drinks and food.Passion fruit margs. HIT! So good. Just the right amount of alcohol to make us tipsy enough to enjoy it. Chris orders stew goat with roti. I, Nik, orders oxtail Rasta pasta. The goat was DEELISHISH. tender. No GOATY taste. Just delicious. Roti was nice, fresh, and warm. Oxtail Rasta pasta- although the oxtail wasn't falling off the bone, it was so tender. I have to emphasize the fact that I got a SIDE OF EXTRA GRAVY. Anybody who's been eating Caribbean food for forever, knows, THIS IS SERIOUSSSSS. That was the most exciting part for me LOL. But I truly didn't even need it. The pasta was so creamy!  The DJ was sooooooo good. I danced in my seat the entire time. Never stopped. I ate and danced in my seat. I danced until I walked out. GREAT MUPINKY came over to speak with us twice and we enjoyed our conversations with her. She told us about the happy hour M-F and Taco Tuesday's. WE'LL BE BAXK! ! ! I have one suggestion- I needed a drink menu. Although they did have a full bar, I like to see drink menus. Maybe there's something new I never had before! Anyway, I loved this place so much. Can't wait to go back. 12:44am. Back in bed. Satisfied. Update: ate my left overs two days later on 07/14. Still delicious.

It was a joke once I open their ""Sautéed ""Crystal@ Shrimp""! First of all, it was not crystal shrimp, it was just standard shrimp! Second, the portion got cut half! Too GREADY! People! I really hate to admit it is true that It s rare to find few of us have the ability to reserve the prestigious Chinese traditional mindset. No more Yu Garden again.","It makes me so much happier now that XLB places are coming up with great options.We must have went through 6 orders of pork and crab XLB among half a dozen other menu items, and for me personally I might go mainly for the XLB. The price point also makes it great to stop in and get your fatty on. Side note: the chopsticks there are super clever/cool to use.","I loved the sweet purple potato mochi with salted egg, crab soupy dumpling and the roasted duck.The yangzhou fried rice was a little bland for my taste but i'll give it a 3/5 stars..We didn't have to wait for a long time to get seated and we did not have to wait long for our food to get served.All in all, 4/5 stars.","This place is located along Bell Blvd, and we came here because it was open late on a Saturday night (we got there around 10). We only ordered two thing: xiao long bao (soup dumplings) and pan-fried dumplings.The xiao long bao is nothing to write home about. The wrapper/skin on these baos is so thin and the bamboo steamer the dumplings are served on are so small that all the dumpings stick together; thus, whenever you try to pull a dumpling out, the wrapper rips and the soup just spills out. Other than that, the actual meat in the dumpling is good but the soup itself is rather cloudy. I find that with soup dumplings, people have their own ways to measure whether they thing they're good or not, and clarity/transparency of soup is one of those for me. These baos aren't my favorite.The pan-fried dumplings, however, are delicious. Everything about them is good - the meat (which I believe is the same near used in the soup dumplings), the beautifully crisp and golden bottom, and the thickness of the dough/skin. I love the way the skin soaks up the soup and it becomes so flavorful.I also really like that this restaurant is open late on weekends, but I haven't found anything quite yet to *really* set it apart from restaurants with similar menus.That being said, I will probably come back to try more of their menu items.*One major thing I disliked about this place was the chopsticks (pictured below). For some reason, they have reusable chopsticks with disposable tips? It makes no sense at all, and it was impractical because, by the end of our meal, the tips had already fallen off for us twice. If they're trying to be ergonomical, they might as well stick with disposable ones. Otherwise, reusable ones make much more sense for a restaurant like this. The chopsticks were a huge turn-off for me.",You Garden Xiao Long Bao
210,"While waiting for a LIRR train, I had almost an hour to kill, so I stopped by Matsuri for a quick lunch. Their lunch specials are reasonably priced. An order of two rolls with soup or salad is only $9, or 3 rolls for $12.Their other stuff on the menu was good as well. Don't forget to try their Chef's Specials. Half dozen oysters are only for $8.",Food was mediocre Sushi quality was not the best. You can get better quality for price other places. Also the waiter was rude and abrupt even if we were nice. Sushi was badly made.,The service and food continues to be spectacular. The sashimi is very fresh and the staff continues to be very attentive. The staff greets you as soon as you enter and even remembers your orders,"Came here on a Saturday evening. It was a cloudy, humid, hot day so not many people were outside. The restaurant was pretty empty but I assume it would get packed on a better day especially since it's located in a great spot by the train station.As soon as I entered I was seated and staff was extremely attentive throughout my visit. I ordered a couple of dishes and my friend ordered two sushi rolls. We were both very hungry and wanted to eat some japanese food for dinner.The miso soup came out first and it was pretty good! I downed it in a minute or two. The fried calamari came out next with a side of sweet chili sauce. Very tasty. My salmon avocado roll came out after that and tasted fresh. Finally, the main course, chicken katsu came out with a bowl of rice. This dish is very yummy. It actually made me really full. I think this entrée alone can fill someone up.The restaurant is conveniently located underneath the 7 line and the LIRR at the 61st Street - Woodside station. I live about a 10 minute walk away so I will definitely return in the future. If you have never been here before, give this place a shot. It is not overrated and worth every star/penny.","Very nice restaurant with a clean and aesthetically pleasing atmosphere in a great location. I stopped in for a quick lunch after reading some of the reviews, and I was not disappointed. I ordered an assorted sushi and sashimi plate along with a few beers. The fish was very fresh and the pieces were quite generous. Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, toro and Uni were outstanding. I was a little disappointed with the tamago egg custard as it looked like something that was premade and had a slightly unnatural artificial orange color to it.Service was very good and the staff was attentive to my needs. There were some specials on the board that looked very appetizing that I may have to return to try. I would recommend that if you are in the area and craving Kaiseki, stop in. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.","For $35, the omakase here is pretty solid. Yes, none of the fish is cured, but each individual nigiri is generously portioned and the fish is fresh. The omakase included uni, and a fried shrimp head. This restaurant is also a bit fancier than I had expected - the menu is printed in color with pictures! If I were in the area, I'd probably check it out again.",Matsuri
211,"Last saturday my boyfriend and I had dinner here . To say that we were disappointed, would be a gross understatement. While the food and drinks were tasty the service and establishment itself were horrendous. My problem with this business is that the prices are way too high, and I expected absolute perfection but that is not the case. I definitely don't reccomend this place unless you like to be ripped off.We walked in with no reservation on a saturday night around 6:25 pm . It was quite empty so seating wasn't an issue . Once we were seated by the bartender and given menus .Our waitress came over and quickly ordered  the ceviche a la diabla as an appetizer . Before we could order our entrees she walked away . So we decided to wait till she made an appearance  again . Once she came over with our appetizer we orders our main course . I ordered the special which was grilled salmon with a pomegranate sauce , shrimp and yuca . I asked if i can substitute the yuca for grilled veggies and she said their would be an up-charge . Which sounded ridiculous but fine at the moment as we were starving . My boyfriend ordered the bandeja típica. Now we ordered before two tables walked in and our food took nearly an HOUR to come out . What left me confused and very irritated was that the tables that arrived after we put our entrees orders got their food before us . How ?? I simply don't understand . I work in the restaurant industry and i am very understanding when its busy and the food takes long but it was half empty and our waitress didn't even come not once to apologize or perhaps even offer my boyfriend another drink as courtesy to keep your customers coming back . After waiting and feeling forgotten for almost an hour we finally got our food . No complaints on my boyfriends entree . But mine was another story . I literally saved my dinner because i asked to have the sauce on the side . The pomegranate sauce was way too sweet and gritty. Had I not specified to have it on the side it would have made my dish inedible . The grilled vegetables were saturated in oil but by then i just wanted to be done with the place and leave . Once again after waiting to get the waitress attention we finally got our bill . Now i understand manhattan establishment prices are in the higher end but there is no reason for overly priced food in queens to make me feel like i was in the city . What made this dining experience even worse was that my the special i ordered was charged $32 for TWO small shrimp , salmon and a few vegetables . I was better off  ordering  their menu item that was the a grilled salmon as well with a side for $23. This place is ridiculous . Its a shame , they have good potential but with their service and price range your better off dining in any of the restaurants with a much better overall dining experience . Theres plenty in the neighborhood . Definitely do not recommend coming here .!","Pros: good food, moderately sized portions, tasty, strong drinksCons: purgatory-like waiting time for food regardless if they're busy or not, courteous waitstaff is hit or miss, music blaring so loud you can't hear yourself think, some overpriced entree options","Nice place overall Good drinks , very very sweet drinks .Food looks great , good display but actual flavor is blandService is horrible had a huge table got no attention and the place wasn't even busy very disappointed. Will not be back","Such a sweet spot in every sense--ambiance, cuisine and the staff was sweet. The place from the outside doesn't stand out much, but the inside and patio is so much more decorative and inviting. The staff all greeted my friend and I and invited us to try the patio. We were treated by the sweetest lady named Laura and got a free sample of drink. They were patient with giving us time to order but didn't forget about us either. We ordered a pitcher of sangria ($30) ribeye mini tacos, guac and chips and mini mofongos with ropa vieja. For dessert we had chocolate cake lava with ice cream. And I must say y'all these dishes were on spot! The price is a bit up there for the location but I see no complaint--the food is worth the price. The music was great as well. I've found a new spot in the neighborhood to bring a group of friends or my partner!!",I was pleasantly surprised by this small and cozy restaurant. I made reservations for 13 guests this past Saturday. I highly recommend the Bocaito platter which feeds 5-6 ppl. The drinks were good and the entrees (although they took almost 45min) were all delicious. The vodka Rose was strong and yummy! They have outdoor seating which is super cute but the weather was a bit chilly so we sat inside. Swing by you won't be disappointed,"OK - Staff? Friendly, they always checking on you, on how you are doing, making sure you are comfortable; and the bartenders are smoking hot for the girls out there that like to have a drink while watching some eye candy . Drinks? I 101% recommend the GUAVA MIMOSAS, to die for. Food? The crab croquetas are 1A+, the bandeja you will want to take another 2GO of how good it is. They have a brunch menu, completely different, but, in my case since I'm a breakfast guy, it's sooo much better. Please go, the place is super nice. The music after brunch is popping.",Bocaito Cafe & Wine Bar
212,Incredible food and incredible service!!!!VERY highly recommend- It's a must stop for me every single time I'm in the city!,"Probably the best French breakfast I have had. Service was quick, but not rushed. Small restaurant- cozy not smushed. Excellent job.",The real deal. The Swiss ham egg galettes are exquisite. Reminds me vividly of French Brittany,"Terrific place. Crepes are awesome, very authentic. The true piece of Bretagne in the heart of Queens ! Owners and services makes this place a real hidden gem!","Gang decided to step in for a Saturday afternoon brunch late July. We were immediately greeted and seated. Background house music along with some french/European decorations set a unique ambiance Waitress was extremely friendly and we ordered brunch option 1 & 2:Homemade Iced Tea - distasteful; str8 sugar and water w/either passion fruit or raspberry flavoring ; ingredients just not right/mix wellIced Coffee - refreshing and came w/ syrup on side to self-determine level of caffeine  Quiche  - amazingly melt in your mouth soft. Good salt level, somewhat buttery, mushroom was not overwhelming and admirable portion size.Egg Florentine - basically egg benedicts w/spinach amongst other toppings. Salad - came in a small bowl ; fresh veggies w/right amount of dressing.Food came out quick and experienced fast service overall. Waitress was kind enough to completely exchange my iced tea for something else. Price to portion/taste ratio within standards. Will return for other items.","The most delicious food in all of Astoria and Long Island City. From the music to the food, you are instantly transported to a quaint French town. If you want great food, a great atmosphere, and an amazingly personalized food experience, come here.",Cafe Triskell
213,"Il Bambino made for a great lunch spot on a holiday Monday. My boyfriend and I shared a Goat cheese and fig spread crostini, Speck panini and Roast chicken panini. I also got a Toffee oatmeal cookie but wasn't a fan - it was way too hard. We both had a sample of the brownie on the way out and it was incredible, should have gotten that instead.","Called twice and was first was told they didn't get the order then called back and was told my food was on my way and it was 40 minutes later and overall 1.45 minutes since order placement. Bad delivery experience again. Crostini came soft, ricotta all over the place and food on top of the storage bin.","Number of Visits: 2Il Bambino is the one spot that focuses on paninis and offers you a variety of melts that is pressed until the cheese is oooey hot. Quite frankly, I just wasn't too impressed with the sandwiches. Some were really strong in flavor and others not so much which all depended on the ingredient.The menu is broken down as simple as possible for you to understand it which is very helpful for first-timers. They tell you where each meat and cheese is from so you can find your combo. There is seating indoors and outdoors, but service is a tad bit slow in my opinion. The staff is busy out back where the crowd is so if you're the only one hanging out inside, there is a tad bit of neglect.","Astoria, Queens is highly underrated, since all the tourists are swamped in manhattan; and they are definitely missing out! Recommended to me by a friend who lives right around the block, I decided to go here as my first lunch trip with her and my party when landing in NYC. When reading the menu, I giggled at ""Pupu Platter"", yes immature, but I had a little laugh. I was wondering what it might be, and thanks to my fellow yelpers, it is a platter of those little slices of crostini they have. Since it was my first time here, I didn't want to go Wild, so I played it safe and ordered their goat cheese with honey crostini. It was a very unique taste, however, it definitely wasn't my WOW! It kind of made me regret not getting the platter to try other amazing crostini. Still not a bad choice! I will definitely want to come back here. It is a great place for a meet up, casual date, and/or small get together. It is cute, cozy, and friendly inside!","Love this place!Paninis are absolutely delicious!!! We had so many of them, but hands down our favorite one is the charred  broccoli. There is an outside patio in the back with excellent service.","Il Bambino is a great casual spot for paninis and crostinis. It's got a modern, pleasing aesthetic that's also comfortable and laid back.  There is a Toronto or Brooklyn vibe about it.  It has a particularly Toronto feel with its large back patio.  Service was friendly and efficient.  I tried two different paninis (split half and half with my friend).  One was a daily special with bacon, avocado, mozzarella, spicy mayo and onion jam and the other was a brunch option panini that also had bacon, bleu cheese, and some other stuff I forget.  Both were so tasty.  Highly recommended!",Il Bambino
214,"The momo here is so flavorful way better than just regular momo. I've so far had the Chaat Momo, Chilli momo, and Sukuti Momo and its honestly one of the best foods I've had.The only downside is the wait time like don't get me wrong the food was mad good but the wait was 40+ min.Tip: combine both the chilli momo and chaat momo for a bomb soupy and spicy momoThis issa must go","Don't order delivery if you don't live nearby, I waited two hours before cancelling with Seamless. Admittedly I don't live close, but for a $6 delivery fee they do come to my neighborhood and quoted a 40-50 minute time frame online and in my confirmation email. Really hate paying extra for food that was picked up by the delivery guy one hour after I ordered it, then carried around town for another hour (confirmed that with the restaurant, if it had arrived it would have been cold and sad), and then dealing with apathetic staff at the restaurant. Calling went as well as you'd expect, whenever you use an online delivery service the restaurant can't help. The delivery guy left but they don't know when he'll be there, they don't have his number to figure it out, etc. Ostensibly anyway. No updates to my online order happened until after I called so they must have some kind of communication. In the end Seamless refunded me and gave me a credit. Hopefully they change their delivery range on Seamless, most of the complaints I see are about this issue. I'd be willing to come in person because I like the concept, the reviews and photos all look great, but I'm not exactly making it a priority.",Worst experience I never had.The cashier refused my payment from my DEBIT card short of $0.80. She said that the owners would make her pay the difference if she did not go out their $10 minimum. I came to this restaurant with 4 other people and I was the only one refused my order as I was the last in line to order and pay. I sat here and watched my friends eat. The register woman knows NOTHING of the menu. She was obnoxious.Highly do not recommend.,"stop everything you're doing and go here right now!  I went here a few months ago.  These are the best, most flavorful veg momos I have ever had.  The owner is very sweet and it is obvious she really cares about the food and puts so much love into it.  Can't wait to visit nyc again and go back!","I want this business to succeed, I really really do. Their vegetarian momos come at a great price and are tasty and made well. But simply put, what is up with the jhol in the jhol momo? The best part about Nepali food is its varied colors, flavors, and textures. The jhol was grey and watery and I've never seen anything like it before. Highly disappointing because it just came off as them skimping on tomato and cilantro and effort. Otherwise, it's a cute place. The wait time for two plates of momos was quite long, but I wouldn't have minded if the jhol momo was worth that wait.","I was hungry and cranky when I got here. So when it took the very busy small kitchen more than half an hour to prep our momos, I had already written off Momo Crave as a place to return.But in the end the food sold me, and I got over my frustration after just two momos. We had a feast including steamed, tandoori, sandeko, and chaat. In the latter three preparations, the momos are first fried before being garnished.The tandoori and chaat were incredible, and the steamed and sandeko were very good. The tandoori momo really does combine the best of a tikka with the flavor of the vegetables in the momo filling. The chaat momo had texture very similar to a samosa chaat.On my next visit I plan to swap out sandeko to try the sizzler momo.",Momo Crave
215,"My husband and I were disappointed at the food here. We only gave it two stars because the pate bahn mi was the only delicious thing we had which we would give 5 stars, but really we'd rate the overall restaurant 0-1 stars. It's a small hole in the wall that maybe seats about 6 ppl total. Most people ordered takeout. For starters we got the shrimp summer roll. It was pre-made. The noodles were bloated and rice skin too chewy from being made 1-2 days ahead of time. We got the Saigon street noodle soup and beef pho. We were so disappointed especially by the Saigon soup. Both soups lacked deep flavor but the Saigon soup tasted nothing like tomato/ chicken broth as the description gave. It was very bland and red from the crab meat I'm assuming because it didn't taste anything like tomato. The meatballs in the soup were such a weird color and consistency, my husband had to ask the cashier if it was cooked through or not. It was very much bland and didn't have much meat or seafood flavor but just mush. There's a sign on the wall that said ""now serving pho"". I'm assuming they use to be a bahn mi only specialty restaurant, which I think they should stick to. The noodles soups were such let downs. My husband described the broths as something you sip on after a hot pot meal at home when you started with just plain water.","An absolute disgrace to all Vietnamese cuisine! Not run by Vietnamese people but food was advertise as viet food. Husband saw the amazing rave about this place so he had to try. Drove all the way from Jersey just to try and it definitely did not hit the spot! The portion size was not worth the money that they charge. Husband ordered Bun Rieu (9.95) and I order the pho classic beef(10.95) and summer roll (5.75) You would think paying for the high price that we would get a large bowl but nope it's a small bowl- Both broth were an absolutely missed and did not have the correct taste and/or flavoring to them. When asked for ""nuoc man"" (fish sauce) he said they did not have any..... How do you not have plain fish sauce when you claim to run a Vietnamese spot??????? And as for the summer roll - an absolutely failure! The sauce that came with it wasn't even done correctly! (Word of advice- lessen the noodle, take out the carrots and replace them with cucumber). Overall, just a Chinese bakery disguised as a Vietnamese bakery- I don't know what the rave is all about but this place is definitely not recommended by me... take your money to an actual pho spot and get your money worth!","Dismal, blah Vietnamese eatery/ take out hole in the wall in Forest Hills with only two tables.  They have very basic Vietnamese dishes here: pho, vermicelli, bahn mi and spring rolls.  Ordered the spring rolls which didn't even come with peanut sauce that they serve everywhere else.  Instead, it comes with fish sauce which just didn't taste good and the rice paper wrap was too tough.  The beef pho was simply too bland.  Watered down broth and the brisket was like shoe leather.  Service was quick and it's quite cheap but the food was just not what I was hoping for.  I left quite disappointed.  Not recommended if you really love Vietnamese food.","This review is only for the vegan Banh Mi Sandwich with Woodear mushroom, shiitake mushroom, carrots, jicama & vermicelli. That is a very excellent sandwich, my favorite sandwich offering in the neighborhood! If you are craving a good vegetarian sandwich - or are craving their apparently excellent Pho and have a vegetarian friend who is skeptical of this place - then I'd recommend this joint. Google 'NYTimes Violet's Bake Shoppe' for the very positive review: 'For me, it comes down to ratios, and at Violet's Bake Shoppe in Forest Hills, Queens, they are golden'","I came in to pick up dinner and ordered online ahead of time. The online ordering was so easy and convenient. Great option. Got the lemongrass chicken rice noodle, grilled pork rice noodle, fish over rice and grilled chicken over rice. All at reasonable price of $8.75 considering meal prices around the area. Provided lots of utensils and fish sauce.Perhaps I ate this much longer after I picked up so the food was just okay. Everything tasted fine but what threw me off was the grilled pork. I was expecting meat similar to the Vietnamese grilled pork chop or grilled pork. This grilled pork reminded me of Chinese sausage that is usually accompanied in fried rice or casserole dishes. The fish was okay and the chicken was fine. Plenty of rice, noodle, carrots and herbs. I definitely want to try the sandwiches next time and will order these dishes again but eat it while fresh and hot.","We ordered a Pork Belly Banh Mi sandwich to go, and thought it was average. The bread could be better. The pork belly included some inedible pieces of cartilage. The sandwich is presented as two-halves: one half of the sandwich didn't seem to have enough pork belly. We did two things to make the sandwich delicious: we toasted the bread to give it a nice, slight crunch; and pan-fried the pork belly a little to bring out the nice buttery flavor of the fat.",Violet's Vietnamese Shoppe

The atmosphere is great but the food is not good.Sat at the bar, ordered 2 Birria and 1 Alpastor taco,instead I got 2 lengua and the 1 alpastor I got was soggy meat.

Could feed a small army in there!They sat us immediately and brought over delicious chips and salsa. I ordered a horchata, tamale and a roast pork taco. Jeffrey ordered a beef burrito. The horchata wasn't the best I've ever had but definitely not the worst. The tamale could of used some sauce but otherwise it was delicious. Now the taco. OMG the taco was amazing. The pork was very tender and the guacamole sauce they put on top was very fresh. Jeffrey loves his burrito but it was massive so she was kind enough to box it up for us. When I tell you it's very authentic, delicious and cost friendly. They are very attentive, with big smiles and just a very lovely disposition.

There is a time and place for those, but when you want authentic Mexican food, do yourself a favor and come to Jackson Heights or Corona.

There is no question about how delicious the food is, more so the authenticity of it.They have a huge selection authentic Mexican food from Breakfast to Dinner. I recommend to to try the Juevos Rancheros or Chilaquiles. You will taste how they are really supposed to be made. We came over the weekend since I was craving some tacos.

Tzatziki is the best here. (I've got to try the baklava next time!)","Óxi to Avli - even tho my dish was inedible , the one star is simply based on the attitude of the manger that worked tonight - Friday 10/4/19.  When I complained to the waitress about my meal, moussaka, which I did not eat, I was handed the bill with the meal that I did not eat on it. I Explain to the waitress at the table that the meal should not have been served. It was clearly old. That tray should have been thrown away days ago. The bechamel was completely dried out, beyond over cooked and burnt. The potatoes were dried out, brown, disgusting ! I've had the dish at Avli several times before as well as other wonderful Greek Restaurants. It was never this horrible. On the way out I asked the waitress about taking it off the bill and the manager stepped in and said ""It was fine,  I tasted it"" .  REALLY ?!??? You're questioning me? You're telling me I should have eaten that old food? She tasted it?????  Did the manager taste from my plate???? Or did she taste from the tray???? Its impossible that she tasted it because the waitress said it was JUST NOW being discussed at their station away from the food area.  She would not have had time to go taste the food, from the time we spoke to the waitress to the time we got up to pay the bill. As a manager, it is VERY rude to question the opinion of the customer when it comes to a meal that was not eaten. JUST LOOK AT MY PICTURES POSTED. She then redid our bill and with attitude she said ""I took it off"". She was Very rude! I know what this dish is supposed to look like and taste like and it wasn't it. Everything else was delicious. The appetizers, the lemon soup, the main course that everyone else had was on point. Our waitress Jen was wonderful and very attentive! My father was in the restaurant business at a very popular restaurant in Manhattan for over 40 years. I've heard plenty of stories growing up about ""the business"" . Perhaps the manager needs to go for some proper training.  Pictures speak a thousand words ...... you be the judge .  One last thing.... It truly disgusts me when a restaurant/chef thinks it's OK to serve someone dried out, old food and expect them to eat it! Would they feed it to their family? Just look at the pictures below ..... Gordon Ramsay would rip you apart.","Just went back tonight . The food is still just as good as I remembered. Our waiter was very nice. The BIG negative about tonight's dinner was the rush . There were plenty of empty tables so I don't understand the reason . We ordered the dip platter as our appetizer . We didn't even get halfway thru our appetizer and BAM The soup arrived , so, that got pushed to the side . No sooner did the last spoonful of soup go in our mouth , BAM the main course was here. I mean seriously ..... I've never been so rushed before . Needless to say , we had our dinner and our appetizer wrapped and took it home. We will slowly enjoy the delicious food at home. People go out to eat because they want a nice relaxed evening out. At least I do. Not sure if I'm going back , it was literally FAST FOOD .","Great little local Greek restaurant.

218,BEWARE: They work w/ yelp to remove bad reviews. My past review has been deleted. And Yelp just removed my tip. The reviews are just way too good for this place. It's just ok. The food is nothing special. I thought the pizza was just ok. It's really nothing special. The wine was cheap - gave me a headache. My moscow mule type drink was not good. Our server was not friendly or helpful. Just kinda did her job.,My husband recently hosted a dinner for 20 people who had just flown in from Sweden.They were given their own private room and were allowed to chose what ever they wanted from the menu (sometimes places seriously limit what you could order with such a large group)Everyone gushed about how amazing the food and service were.Place was a home run.,"Came for brunch!First of all, service was incredible. I never felt rushed but I felt very well attended to. In fact, if our drinks were 3/4 empty, someone started a new drink for us and brought it over without asking. Honestly, good service at a bottomless brunch is pretty darn rare and I appreciated it quite a bit.Onto the food- I got the lobster BLT which was bonkers - so damn good. TONS of lobster. Loved the potatoes on the side, truly delicious.We also got the truffle eggs, which were good but not as mind blowing as the lobster BLT.-1 star because they auto gratuity. Crazy enough, I would have tipped more than the auto but was so putt off by it I let it be.","Guess what, this place is still amazing. I have come here multiple times including for trying dinner. The quality of the service, the food, the decor, the option for outside seating, and the prices are all amazing. Last time I talked about brunch, which is of course great. Now I will talk about dinner. Food; Portuguese Octopus - octopus with jalapeno pesto, crispy nugget potatoes, and rocket arugula. The octopus was soft and we'll cooked. The jalapeno pesto was sour and refreshing and went extremely well with the octopus. I've dreamed of this since eating it. One of the best octopus dishes I have had in the city. Truffled Mac and Cheese - Mac and cheese and bechamel, wild mushrooms, garlic herb crumbs. Another great dish. Loved the truffle. Also one of the best Mac and Cheese dishes in the city. I have also tried tuna tartare, mini skewers, and steak au poivre. I can't wait to try some of the other dishes.","My friend saw this place mentioned in a TimeOut article on best brunch places in Queens. We, group of 5, decided to try it for brunch. We ended up having a great time, satisfied with both the food and atmosphere. The only thing that was a slight negative was that since we were seated in the back, behind all the curtain tables, we couldn't see the live performers since the curtains were in the way. We got the brunch price fix at $17 which included drinks and a choice from egg based dishes, brick oven pizzas or paninis. Some dishes came with salad or potato cake. The food: I got the Breakfast Lox brick oven pizza. It was delicious and oh so filling. There was one egg in the middle of the pizza, I cut it open and let it run, and spread the egg yolk over all the slices of the pizza. The tomato was a good addition since it balanced some of the heaviness of the other ingredients. The portion size was great and I could barely finish the last few slices. It didn't come with any sides but since I was already unable to finish the whole thing I think the pizza itself was more than enough. The atmosphere: There's live brunch performance from noon to 3pm. There was a singer and someone that played an instrument. They were situated at the very beginning of the restaurant by the entrance door (not sure if thats the case each time). I sort of wished that they had taken down the curtains over the booths during brunch time so everyone in the restaurant could see the performers and get more light in from the windows and then they could put them back up for dinner time. We were sitting under small skylight windows so at least we got some natural light coming in (I prefer natural light during brunch), but maybe if you are sitting by the entrance there's more of it coming through the windows. The live music was soothing and even during intermissions they played pretty good songs over the speakers (mostly popular songs).The service: Pretty good and the server was attentive. Enjoyed brunch and would be open to coming back for dinner (I can definitely see how those booths with curtains could make for a pretty romantic or intimate ambiance during dinner time).","I've been coming here for over 4 years. Usually, I come for brunch on the weekend which is a fantastic time. There is live music, the service is great and the price is reasonable. This time, I came here on a Friday night for dinner and the food was just as delicious. We had the Portuguese Octopus and the Teres Major Steak. Even though the Octopus was on the appetizer menu, it is a decent sized portion to work as a main dish. It was tender and sizzled in your mouth. The steak came with sweet mash potato and asparagus hearts. It may seem strange to have something sweet with steak but it actually works in this case. The service is great and our waiter was very attentive. The drinks and food came fast. Overall, it was a great place to grab a bite for a date or a night out.",DiWine
219,"INCREDIBLY RUDE STAFF!! A couple of friends and I came here for dinner before heading to a birthday party. I came a bit late and the waiter didn't even give me a menu or give me the time of day. We order and as we were waiting, a waiter (male, big eyes, receding hairline) dropped a large bottle of water on our table, making a loud ""BANG"", knocking over the candle and and covered my friend with water and candle wax. Instead of apologizing they just asked if she ""was ok"" and then left. No apology. No offer to cover her dinner because she was now drenched in water and has wax all over her hand, face, and jacket (now ruined). When a waitress came to give us our food, we asked her to give our friend new silverware and glass because they were covered in wax. She gave us a glare and grabbed the items to replace. When we talked to the manager, the waiter came up to him, said something in French and they both chuckled. No real apology. When my friend came back from the bathroom, the waiter came and said that we were overreacting and that shit happens. THIS IS NOT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!! He rose his voice at us and said that she can send him the invoice for the jacket (not sure if he will honor). Turned off at how he spoke to us, we left without even eating our food. The way they treated us was extremely unacceptable. Not even just as customers, but as human beings. I DO NOT recommend dining here. The service is abhorrent.. and I wonder if he fact that we were three women of color had anything to do with it...","I've been going here for years and the service has always been impeccable.  Until recently when I went with my brother and niece for dinner.  We had a 3 course meal and they never bussed our table.   We sat there for an hour with the dirty dishes piled up.  Maybe they were understaffed?  Other than this incident, it's a nice place to eat.","Several years ago, we had a bad experience here, but we wanted to see if things have changed, so we went back there yesterday. Unfortunately, things are worse: the menu hasn't changed, the portions are tiny, and the tables are so close together that if you're sitting in an inner seat, you have to move the table all the way to get out. In addition, the waitstaff seemed totally disinterested: no one came over to explain the long wait for the food to appear or to to see if everything was okay during our meal. Finally, it was very obvious that anyone who speaks French is treated better than those who don't. This is so disappointing because we live two blocks away and love going out to eat.","My friend had mentioned a while ago that she wanted to grab dinner at Tournesol, so last night we decided to come here for dinner.We came around 6pm, and we decided to sit outside. The man that was assisting us was so kind and helpful. We weren't sure what to drink and he let us sample the two wines we were contemplating over.We both decided to get the steak frites. The Food was amazing, it was cooked perfectly and the peppercorn sauce was flavorful. The french fries were light and crisp as well! We ended the night with creme brûlée. It was light and airy, not too sweet.As we finished up dessert our kind waiter gave us a complimentary French cookie; it literally melted in your mouth! What a great Restaurant, the service was fantastic as well as the food.","I finally returned here after about 6 years. It's even more pleasant than I remember. We sat outside since it was a nice day. We were greeted by a pleasant waiter who worked with us throughout the whole dinner. He let us try both wines that we couldn't decide on and consistently came around to see that we were okay. To drink, we ordered a bottle of the Californian Brut. It was a little on the sweet side, but not overwhelming. It was also refreshing for a warm day. To eat, we ordered the steak frites with peppercorn sauce. It took a little while to come out but it was awesome! The steak was juicy and seasoned well.The fries were hot and crunchy. I soaked up the excess peppercorn sauce with the slices of baguette they gave us. It was all so delicious.For dessert, we went with the famous French staple, the creme Brûlée. It was a perfect end to an amazing meal. This is also an amazing spot for dog watching! I must have seen at least 10 cute puppers during my meal! I'm returning soon.","A wonderful ""old"" established french restaurant here in L.I.C. they were here before L.I.C. was even on the map (almost) They never disappoint..",Tournesol
220,Run by Chinese folks. I am Vietnamese and not one word of Viet was spoken. I came in at 10am as this was the time it would open as posted but the waiter said 11am so I returned the next day.I am from the Bay in Cali so I had to temper my expectations.Pho broth is average but edible.Bone marrow that was included is a novelty and I would presume so is the lobster pho.,"Extremely disappointed with my meal. I order the most basic item from the menu. Grilled pork chop over rice $7.95 The pork was tough, not a lot of flavor. Its a confusing situation, they serve the food on a oversized plate, the tables are small. We were seating on a table for 7ppl and there was barely any space for water glasses. Server had no idea how to even service the table. A few ppl in our table had the pho and they couldn't even set the platter ( bowl is served on a wooden tray) on the table. Very awkward service, on too of that they have a grade pending which is not displayed on the front as customers come jn to the restaurant. Instead they have it hidden on a shelf on the wall and can only be seen when you walk up to the register.Will not be back for sure! I tasted the pho, while it was a large bowl it was just ok.","Affordably priced Vietnamese food with a fancy interior! In a hurry and without thinking, I ordered the beef and spring roll rice vermicelli without asking to remove the peanuts that usually come with this. Entirely my fault. When the food arrived, I had asked the waitress if I could possibly get one without nuts and even though she was hesitant because of some policy within the restaurant/she would be wasting food, she had the kitchen make another one without nuts. I'm TRULY grateful for her as I know the situation could've been avoided had I been more alert and conscious of what I was ordering. And surprisingly I did not have to wait too long for the food to come the second time. Service was fast and the ratios of all the ingredients were perfect. I was FULL. I also got the calamansi juice and while it's a little watered down to me, it was refreshing and just what I needed.","This place lives up to its name! It has the best broth! I'm not a fan of pho but I loved this! The lobster pho was $15. I just wish the lobster had been dunked in lemon or lime juice prior to cooking to get rid of that seafood smell. Otherwise, it was perfect. The noodles were good. I didn't try the coconut dessert since it contains gelatin & the employees have no idea if its pork gelatin. It looked amazing. I'd like to know what type of gelatin it contains tho.","Pho best is found inside Arcadia mall. Like this Pho Best location a ton more than the one on Prince Street. Service here was much better. Came here on a weekday to grab a quick lunch since it was the nearest lunch spot that came up on Yelp. I  was very skeptical about coming here because of the experience I had at their other location. We ordered two regular bowls of pho with ribeye and were given a  ton of bean sprouts, basil, and lime. The food was great. The AC was on high, the place did not feel crowded, and the staff were very attentive. Service here is definitely better than the other pho places in the heart of Flushing. No bathroom inside the restaurant though. I saw a ton of people ordering takeout, so this spot must be pretty reliable. 10/10 would recommend!","I went for it! I ordered lobster pho and added a bone marrow, the items that lured me in to begin with. The price for both items are a bargain. The photos looked great. The pho...not so great. I felt my bowl that night was bland, lacking complexity in the broth. The lobster, although fresh, was overcooked and rubbery. Bone marrow was on point though. Moms ordered vermicelli. The sauce was uniquely more garlicky than most and we liked that, so we'll be back for that, if nothing else.We were split on the shrimp summer rolls. They came out warm and freshly rolled. Moms loved the sauce, but I didn't love it as much. It wasn't bad at all, just not my fave in the city. Taste is so subjective. Overall, I think they've still got something worth coming back to. Bad broth 'that one time' won't prevent me from giving it another try. We had great service. Both servers and management were friendly and attentive.",Pho Best
221,Food is good but they have to learn basic costumer service. I've eaten here a ton and even ordered delivery. I go in for taco Tuesday to be told I can't take it to go? That's ridiculous especially since I was ordering other things off the menu and this place is usually dead. If you're having a special (especially tacos what u make already on the main menu) just let the costumer have it because they can easily walk to the next street and get amazing tacos for $3.00.  I don't see this place staying in business since they are usually dead and clearly won't accept money from a paying costumer.,"Really disappointed with the service and food this time I went. This was our pancakes. I asked for the nutella with strawberries and bananas. I told the server I would pay extra. Also, I ordered my food on the phone twenty minutes before I arrived and he didn't put it in to his system till I called a second time to remind him. These were my my pancakes this time. I really liked this restaurant a lot but not anymore. Notice how there's hardly any Nutella or strawberries.","Trendy Mexican place, a little pricey but cocktails and food were good, my only complaints would be no chips while you wait for your meal, and no frozen margaritas....only on the rocks :(","Update !! We came back and they definitely redeemed themselves. We ordered the cemita burger again and it was perfect. Everything was great. We ordered a few drinks from the drink menu, specifically the tamarind mojito, was soooo good. Omar was our waiter and he was very attentive. I'm glad we decided to give them a second chance.","The cemita burger was missing ingredients that were listed in the menu. The wAitress missed half of the order so the person I was with and I ended up eating at different times. Most of the food was bland. I ordered the fish tacos and although they were super late they were amazing. However, I will be returning to try out the drink menu as they have interesting choices on the menu. Laly's has a chance to redeem themselves with us, let's hope it was a bad day.","I wanted to likev this once more,  I guess we chose it because they had specials advertised outside, it had a sanitary grade of A and it was really clean.  The hostess told us to sit wherever we wanted and gave us nenus.As I was walking to the bathroom I noticed some other menus on the bar. One was the specials & the other was the drinks. When I got back from the bathroom the waiter had brought over the menus to the table. They advertise margaritas for happy hour outside and Taco Tuesdays any taco 3 dollars each. We were the only people inside of the place. The waiter told us that the margaritas that were part of a happy hour were only the regular margaritas you weren't able to get any flavor margaritas. I had my heart set on a strawberry margarita so I had to pay full price for it which was I believe $12 each. I really didn't know what I wanted and when I was looking at the menu I wasn't too impressed because it seemed to be more of like a diner with some Mexican food. I was so indecisive. I also didn't like that they didn't even provide chips and salsa for the table like most mexican restaurants do.I finally just ordered a shrimp quesadilla. My friend ordered fish tacos. And my other friend ordered a chicken quesadilla.My shrimp quesadilla, how can I describe it? Well it definitely needed more flavor way too many onions and peppers. I like the fact that it had Oaxaca cheese. It also came with some guacamole Pico de gallo and a white sauce that definitely was not sour cream but looked more like ranch dressing. We did order guacamole for the table and it was quite a small portion but then again it was only $8. The guacamole itself you could tell it wasn't fresh it was super cold so you could tell it wasn't made to order and it needed to salt and some lime juice. The chips could have been heated they were probably out of a bag. One my friends fish tacos arrived, they smelled so good so I decided to order one of the fish tacos. I had one triangle of my shrimp quesadilla and then just ate the fish taco that I got. I took the other two pieces of quesadilla home. The fish taco was really good. The fish itself was fried crisp with a thin batter it had a cabbage slaw on top and a spicy smoky type of sauce on it that was very tasty. I kind of wish that's all I had gotten instead of the quesadilla, like I said before the quesadilla had too many onions and red peppers and they were big pieces and they seemed to be just sweated out a little bit before being placed into the quesadilla.The service was good,  place was clean but they should offer all margaritas for happy hour & at least provide complimentary chips & salsa and heat the chips!",Laly's Restaurant
222,"Ordering and atmosphere: Music too loud, can't hear server or each other. Lots of ""WHAT?!""Drinks: Mom orders 2 moscatos, gets 2 rosés insteadAppetizers and salad: meatballs were quite good, mozz sticks were not hot at all, a mild luke coldish. Caesar salad was dry as all hell. Did the chef take a mister and lightly spray the dressing on the Caesar salad? No taste whatsoever.Entrees: Nothing out of the ordinary. Standard Italian fare.",No parking. Very crowded. Squeezed tight. Once inside there's no emergency escape. If you're upstairs even tighter. And the stair climb id not for the faint at heart. Food was good. Will try Williamsburg next.,Was there on Sunday night hostess sat us didn't see the waiter for 20 minutes. My friend had the chicken Marsala it was watery and tasteless I had the Veal Milanese it was horrible thin and tasteless as well .waiter asked if wanted to take it home I told him to throw it out it wasn't fit for my dog ... never again,"Had late lunch here. Service is terrific! The guys are sweet, sincere and attentive. Note, it was pretty much empty so can't speak to when they're busy. We ordered eggplant parm app, baked clams and meatball side. Entrees were the sole, flaky and flavorful. salmon was moist. Rib eye comes sliced on cutting board and was a beautiful presentation and good char with delish potatoes. I had the fioretti, that was total comfort food. The spinach under each of the fish dishes was not stringy or overcooked, a welcome surprise. The sauce on the meatballs was light and fresh. The eggplant was perfect. Toasted almond dessert is not to be missed or the Nutella pizza. Tartufo a classic. The montepulciano was organic! Cappuccinos were creamy and yum.The cons: the side of rigatoni was too al dente, needed at least another 1-2 mins. Stuck to your teeth. The fioretti needed more mushrooms. I maybe saw three slices!!!! Adding more pancetta and peas wouldn't hurt either. Meatballs were overworked, although moist with beef flavor wasn't our favorite. We like onions and parsley in them, moms recipe. Broccoli rabe also needed another few minutes in the sauce pan. Lastly, needed the bread toasted, it was mushy.Would go back.",My first time here and I Loved this restaurant.  The service was excellent.  They even comped us a drink due to our  wait time.  I had seafood and pasta and the meal was delicious! Authentic Italian food! And when it came to desserts.. oh my  We will be going again for a birthday dinner and I can't wait! I definitely recommend this place!,"I had dinner with family and the place was very busy and loud. The tables were not uniformed because not all the tables had red tablecloths. The tables that had red tablecloths were assigned to customers who knew management or were regulars.  Service was standard, our dishes supposed to come with a side of salad but we never got the salad. There was a sense of bias because we were treated as second classes because we were not Italian or Spanish. There a Chinese family who had a birthday dinner and we learned that for each birthday the ambiance turns into a loud nightclub.  That could be a good thing or that could irritate someone. As for the food, food portions were family style. We got the calamari as the appetizer and the breading was good and not chewy. Our pasta dishes were really good and it took three days to finish it so definitely worth the cost. We got the tiramisu for dessert and it was delicious but portions could be bigger for the cost of it.  Overall the restaurant is a huge space and great for holding parties. The value of the meals is on point with the portions. I would give the restaurant another chance just needs friends to join in to try their pizzas.",Patrizia's Of Maspeth
223,"Overpriced for the food quality. The photos on yelp doesn't match the food you get in the restaurant.  The noodle and the broth is not flavorful. I was very excited to give it a try, but sadly this is just one of the restaurant that needs better chef and staff to match the price.","I've been coming here for years and I obviously love them! Fresh noodles, super reasonable prices, and great staff! I can't go to any other ramen shop in the Bayside/Flushing area. Only flaw is that the front of the restaurant the seating is very cramped but the restaurant is not the biggest so I understand but the ventilation kinda sucks in the front and you feel like you're sweating over your hot bowl of ramen. Not a good combo. Besides that I have no complaints!","Ugh. How looks can be deceiving!!! I was really looking forward to a bowl of steamy, hot, hit the spot type of ramen. Instead, I got a bowl of COLD, less than average, soupy noodles. Truly disappointed. The broth completed lacked all flavor, pork was tough and had a weird texture, you could tell the corn was just defrosted, broth was COLD... honestly the list goes on. It was a train wreck. Safe to say I won't be returning.",Came here on date night a few weeks ago. I really enjoyed my time here I was for some reason under the impression that it was just a ramen spot but I was mistaken. They have delicious desserts and teas as well as entree options that aren't limited to ramen.The place is dim lit and has a very trendy feel to it and the service is great. They're very accommodating and don't seem mind me asking numerous questions. They're very detailed in explaining a dish and just over all warm and friendly. The ramen broth was very flavorful and savory. It had the perfect ratio of broth meat and toppings. The squid tasted very fresh and the meats in our ramen was cooked to perfection. I also enjoyed a cup of setouchi tochu cha (deeelish) at the end of my meal which was a very pleasant finishing touch to our dinner. Highly recommend this place!,"Ordered the tempura set. I think it was like 20 buck. Not bad i guess. But tbh the menu is overall kinda pricey. The food are Pretty good but kinda blend for my taste. The drink teas kinda watery. Maybe i should get the ramen next time.. cause you just cant go wrong with ramens . Very clean place, good atmosphere, good service, and yeeahh. Nice instagram photo worthy place if you like pics of food. Overall not a bad experience, will be back to try other for sure.","We used to come here pretty often. Definitely one of our go-to's when we are around Bayside. Great restaurant all around. However, I've noticed the quality has gone down a bit over the past few years. Still a great place to go, but no longer a 5 star type of place in my opinion. Their Tonkatsu and Shoyu Ramen are great. You get a good amount of food and the price is pretty typical. It's fortunate to have a good ramen shop in this area, so you don't have to travel all the way to the city. They have a large table in the back that can seat large parties of 12 or more. The servers are all very nice and the service is good.",Nippon Cha
224,"This review is for delivery.The food was good, but it wasn't THAT GOOD. For my taste, there were too many spices. Just didn't do it for me. The French fry option gave me too many fries in my gyro. Not into it. I can see why people like this place, it has a lot of potential. It didn't wow me. I will probably try it again. ‍","High quality gyros and souvlaki for sure. Everything could be seasoned a bit more, but the veggies are Fred tasting and the pita hot. I just discovered this spot and can't wait to add it to my rotation for local eating.","How you're gonna be the manager in your restaurant, lights on, in the act of eating yet have the sign facing ""CLOSED"" on the door, when right below this same 'closed sign' shows a 10p closing-time? It's 9:45p!! That's so unprofessional. Yet, even after signaling to him hey, it's 9:45p, he just continues eating, makes no effort to apologize or explain, while I'm standing in the rain. The food must be really good to deserve 5*****, cause that vibe sure ain't worth more than 2**! And I'm voicing that specifically. Your attitude stinks!!","I went here as a last minute choosing for my boyfriend and our friend because this other place that we wanted to go to moved! This place is absolutely phenomenal.So much taste in the meat, the tzatziki was my favorite, reasonable prices, and very friendly owner!! He gave me free seltzer because I ate so much LOL!!!I totally recommenced coming here for dinner since lunch is quiet","Wow!  We ordered the Mix Grill Combo Platter and were so impressed.  There were so many delicious meats on the platter, each with their own individual flavors.  Don't order this if you're eating alone...it is so much food! The restaurant is clean and the service is friendly.  Definitely stop in next time you're in Astoria!","I was looking for a nice and quiet Mediterranean spot to go to with my boyfriend for lunch. We decided to visit Koroni after seeing all the amazing reviews. We were seated immediately and greeted with a warm smile from the employee there. There were many other customers who seemed to be regulars at this restaurant based on their interactions with the owner. The decor was very brick and mortar which was very different than what I was used to but it was refreshing. My bf and I waited a while for our food, but that was expected since we were warned in advanced that the food is made fresh so the wait would be a little long. Unfortunately, we only paid for the 1 hour street parking so we were a little worried that we wouldn't get the food in time. The food finally came after 20 or so minutes and boy, was it worth the wait. Our gyros were so fresh and the meat was so juicy that we finished them in less than 10 minutes. Next time, I will definitely have to bring more people so I can try out the combo platter. The table next to us ordered it and the aroma of their plate was moving throughout the restaurant. P.S. We were able to make it in and out of the restaurant within 50 minutes so no parking ticket for us! Yay",Koroni Souvlaki and Grill
225,"The salads were very dry we had to ask for more dressing, the waitor was funny, the atmosphere was quiet and the carrot cake was as enough for 3 people.",I'm torn bc the food was okay and atmosphere was adorable. But the server messed up my order and the same waiter told the table next to us that they had to leave while they were finishing their drinks. His tackiness dropped them from 4 to 3 stars.,The food was absolutely great. The home-fries were flavorful and crispy. The maple bacon just as good as the Uncle Jacks... The Dutch baby is unique and not super sweet.,"Great food and service. Went for brunch today with two friends. Food took about 40 minutes to arrive but only because they had a party of TWENTY TWO (loud and annoying) people. Service was great and the food too. We had the fried chicken, steak and eggs, waffles and huevos rancheros. Everything was amazing and the owner even came over to check on us and offer free dessert for the wait. Will definitely return!!!!","Came here for the first time for brunch and the food was fabulous. Interior is rustic and cute with a few tables outside in the nice weather. We got seated right away on a Saturday morning. First off, you get a free drink with entree at brunch which I thought was awesome. Options are mimosa, thyme lemonade and Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary had a great kick and the lemonade was refreshing. I had the Dutch baby with a side of pork apple sausage. Never had a Dutch baby before, was kind of like a doughy pancake. The top was crispy but inside soft, covered with butter and maple syrup. My boyfriend had the half fried chicken which was DELICIOUS, so crispy and tender. It didn't come with any sides though which I thought was a little strange. The honey carrot on the menu is actually a sauce. My friend had the steak & eggs, which was a huge portion. The steak was cooked to perfection and chimichurri was extremely flavorful. We shared the cheddar grits which were creamy and delicious. Overall, very well priced menu (especially since you get a free drink) and everything we had was awesome. Would recommend!","Late review, cause I was too full to be able to write anything when I was done there, some other night.My husband, a couple of friends and I went there on a Sunday night to have some good food, and catch up.It was my first time at The Pomeroy, and it's definitely not gonna be the last.The service was great, so far, until the owner himself, came to the table and said that we should definitely order the ravioli - special of the day.I thought to myself ""Somebody over ordered ravioli in this place"", but ok, with the power of suggestion, 3 of us ordered the ravioli.Oh, boy... I wish it was an over ordered.That thing was one of the most delicious food I've had in the last 5 years. The texture, the flavor, the amount, everything was way too perfect. I kept thinking about it for the entire week.We had appetizers, entrees, desserts and drinks, all of us, and the bill was less than $50 bucks per person.Considering the quality and quantity of food we had, and the great service, I couldn't recommend this place enough!",The Pomeroy
226,Owner knows his stuff. Everything from the price point to the taste beats other spots near by. Being the new restaurant around the way they definitely shine from the crowd.,"Very unfriendly environment for non Korean people! They stare at anyone that doesn't look like them. And the workers as well as the boss talks while looking at you so it's safe to assume they are talking about the non Korean customers. The food I ordered was also very small in quantity for the price I paid. And the side dishes were not even fully delivered until I asked! Overall very bad experience, never coming here again!!!","What a shame. Good food here, but expect to find additional items on your bill that you didn't order or receive! I recently came here with a small group of people for dinner. We ordered various things on the menu, including an order of pork belly. We also ordered drinks for the table (soju, beer, water). All was well until we finished eating, and I asked for the check. I normally don't scrutinize the bill when I'm at a restaurant, but this time I did because the server who went to retrieve my bill spent an extended period of time looking at the bill with another staff member (I assumed to be someone in management) before bringing it to me. I found that we had been charged not only for the order of pork belly, but twice additionally for extra servings of it. We were also charged for 7 bottles of Soju, when we only ordered and received 4 of them. I called the server over and asked about the discrepancies. As if annoyed by me questioning anything, they quickly took the bill and went back to the person they spoke with earlier. In Korean, the manager told the server (note: I'm American, but they didn't know I speak Korean) to apologize for the miscount on the soju, but to tell us we got all the pork belly that was on the check. The server came over to the table again, and said exactly that. I responded to both of them in Korean and said ""you know that isn't correct"" and I've never seen anyone get so red in the face before.  After a flood of apologies, my bill was quickly adjusted, and I paid and left. I am extremely disappointed with my experience here, and I will undoubtedly never come back. Such a shame, because the food was great. I'll stick to my regular spot from now on. Sincerely, Disappointed Customer","We were watching David Chang on Ugly Delicious with David Choe and they were doing an episode on Bbq.  A big chunk of it was on Korean bbq.  We hadn't eaten dinner and all of sudden I was asked if I wanted to go to Korean bbq.  I guess you could say we were starving and had a hankering for kbbq.  I was over the moon and dancing because if I don't have Korean bbq every once in a while- I become a corpse.  The restaurant was open late and their service wasn't too bad.  When we walked in it wasn't too busy even though we made reservations.  There aren't too many seats and I would advise to unless or you could just walk-in as I saw many others do.  The first waitress was very matter of fact and did her job well to just make sure we were fed.  Nothing friendly or curt.  We ordered LA Kalbi and ssamguypsal.  The kalbi was delicious and the pork was equally good also.  I appreciated how they would come by accordingly without asking to cut the meat and without attitude always kept a good supply of side dishes or other condiments we wanted. I liked how they gave the steamed egg and korean paste bean soup on the side.  We also ordered the seafood pancake and it was pretty good.  I have a go to spot that isn't accessible anymore, but this place comes close with the taste and texture.  I like it usually more crispy and thin, but it was satisfactory here.  I just didn't like how the second waitress decided to place on piece on a plate that I was already eating other items from without asking me.  You have to keep it bare and clean for the pancake.  Don't want it to be spoiled by other tastes.  Bottom line I had a good dinner and glad the service wasn't shitty like it is at a lot of the korean places in Queens.","Having eaten close by a number of times before I always walk past and see a decent crowd. I finally made the decision to drag T.H. out for a meal here just this past Sunday for Korean Thanksgiving (Chuseok). While the restaurant itself didn't have any particular specials for this holiday, the restaurant was still full and smelled great. We ended up as a party of 5 as a few of T.H.'s friends decided to tag along. We ordered the unmarinated beef combo, the pork combo, seafood soondubu, and a nengmyun (cold noodles). The unmarinated beef came with brisket, tongue, flank steak, short rib, and ribeye. Meanwhile the pork combo came with pork belly, pork jowl, and a pork chop served with grilled onions. I can definitely report that the meats were not only delicious but also were well cooked by the staff. They did a good job cracking jokes with us and making sure all our side dishes stayed replenished. Hilariously, our waiter kept on referring to the soju and beer as waters. Before each meat combo is cooked, they also bring it out and you can view the entire platter. The soondubu was flavorful and not too spicy. It also didn't give too much of the msg aftertaste and phlegm that I often get after eating at BCD. The seafood itself was fresh and the tofu was perfect. The nengmyun was made with arrowroot noodles instead of buckwheat which made them easier to eat though I missed the chewy texture. The broth for the nengmyun was a little sweet for my taste but like normal, the addition of mustard and vinegar went a long way to correct the flavor. So why only 4 stars? The food was delicious, the service was great. I like going a second time to confirm greatness! But also, I need to go and order some of the other dishes. Their website advertises that they make all their own broth and while I had a taste with the soondubu, I'd love to confirm its deliciousness with yukhwejang, seollongtang, etc. Until next time!","Realized the Korean portion of my review wasn't reflecting properly. I guess it'll just be English.-----Ssam Tong really raised the bar in Murray Hill. As much as I love the green tea pork on crystal plate next door, the reason I walk into Ssam Tong is really for the experience. Yes, you read that correctly, for experience.First, I'm a Korean-American 90's baby, they're always playing my jam. I eat and heal after dinning here. I call it Ssam Tong magic. And the staff?... He's your brother from another mother, he knows meat, and he makes sure you having a good time. I see in most of restaurants, (as I also worked restaurant most of my life) good boss house good employees. They set up good examples and employees flourish. I don't know the boss and staff personally but just enough from visiting, I know they're good people. They're people you'd like to say hello if you bump into them at a local grocery store. Shout out to all awesome, hard-working bosses!Last but not least, did you see the marbling? No joke. Hats off to the master chef in the kitchen! How? Wh- from where, w- what in the world. Where did you buy this meat? I have no words.Bottom line, Korean BBQ. Ssam Tong. End of story.",Ssam Tong
227,"Ordered takeout from Grubhub and I was definitely disappointed. The pulled pork sandwich was horrible on that thick toasted bread. They should've put it on a brioche bun or some other bun. The pork itself was well seasoned and taste great but the bread ruined it. I scooped my pork out of the bread and just ate it with a fork. The ribs were great but very tough to bite into. The flavors were all there but the meat was so hard so it also ruined the ribs for sure. I also had the brisket which was a huge disappointment and very fatty. Coleslaw was very very dry, I had to add my own mayonnaise here at home. The cornbread was also dry. Overall I was not happy at all with this place. I may not be ordering again. I mean the flavors are there but they need to work on their cooking times.",Well after waiting for 2 hrs we received inedible cold coagulated food .What should of been burntend lettuce wraps was coagulated cheese over fatty pieces of meat on-topof lettuce that has to be a few days old from the brown tint it had. Ive ordered from here numerous times and this really is unacceptable and a health hazard (i was the field sanitation inspector for my army unit) . For the cheese to coagulate and dry like glue means the food was left out long enough  for bacteria to start forming.  This is like one of those episodes out of kitchen nightmares. Health department will be getting a call along with the pics.,"I've been here before but I've only ordered takeout and the food was pretty good I've always ordered the brisket with the Tangi St. Louis sauce. This time my friend and  I decided to eat at the restaurant at my request because I raved about the brisket. The second we walked in there was a smell of bathroom mixed with cleaner, and it's very cold out so we decided to sit farther into the restaurant but the farther we went the stronger the smell got. So we decided to sit at a high table by the window, it was very cold. The whole place smelled like cleaner.I'm a little annoyed that the brisket came out very gamy and dry it's definitely not what I had ordered a while back we had no choice but to send it back even the owner came to the table and said that this is ""garbage I can't believe the service to you"". Then we decided to just order something else off the menu so I ordered the chicken and waffles and the spinach artichoke dip and my friend ordered the crispy chicken. We figured that they can't RUin crispy chicken, because that would be a crime! My chicken and waffles were not the best ,the waffles were very low-quality and they just fell apart as soon as they brought it to the table there was no crunch and no flavor I had to ask the waitress to bring extra sauces. The artichoke and spinach dip was gross way too much cheese and it was hard and cold the second  they brought it to the table. I barely Touch my food and decided to go use the restroom the waitress said that there's two restrooms in the back that I could use either or, I first walked into the restroom on the left-hand side and then I noticed that the toilet handle is broken and that the water would not run so I left that bathroom and went to the next bathroom not to mention both bathrooms smelled horribly the other bathroom had the same problem with the water not going down that Would you like the smell... and to top it all off I purchased a $10 coupon which covers a $20 meal on yelp but they wouldn't accept my coupon. I basically left there very nauseous and Unhappy. I don't know how this place is still open but I judge a place by the bathroom and that bathroom is gross and it's never busy inside which means they're not rotating food as much as they should and they could be serving frozen food that is not fresh. Overall I'm super unhappy and regret I started my new year at such a gross restaurant","I just started ordering from this location. (Usually pretty late at night) I have ordered their classic sliders and it was amazing. Definitely worth a try.I also ordered their mash potatoes, which may be a little overpriced, is pretty great.I live pretty far from this place, but I appreciate that they do delivery to Jackson heights!","Where do I start ???? I really wanted to give this spot a try because I was in the mood for some bbq.When I got there  the restaurant was cold and empty.but I still gave it the benefit of doubt. Cravings will do that to you.  so we ordered Macaroni and cheese. Half a rack of baby ribs (with some peach sauce) Brisket, baked beans and the spinach artichoke dip which was only for the look .it look pretty but was very cold oh yeah and the chorizo sausage It did not come from the grill.So overall The mac and cheese was good The brisket was okayThe baby back ribs was blahThe dip was yuck And the bake beans were good but cold.I will not be coming back here however the waitress was AMAZING !",My wife and I went here for first time.  6pm on a Saturday night.  There was one guy at the bar and no one eating.   The place had an odor of being old and stale.  The atmosphere was dark and not inviting.  We figured we would stay we heard they had good food.  The waitress/bar tender was pleasant.  We got our appetizer in a decent time span.   Brussels sprouts.  They were burnt.  Really burnt.  Our main course took almost 40 minutes to come from when we ordered it.   I ordered pulled chicken. It was chicken pulled off bone with bbq sauce thrown on top. Chicken was dry  bbq sauce was from a jar.   My wife had the chicken wings which were not spectacular.  Macaroni and cheese that came with my dinner had no taste The ceasar salad was good. Over priced for the amount of food we got.,Slide Bar-B-Q
228,"Third time here and having mixed feelings due to service. We were excited to come here and try out the dinner menu from all the savory instagrams pics. Patience is what was needed tonight as we watched and taught our kids how service should be. Water should be served rather than having to ask for it several times. Menus should be provided right away. Tables should be cleaned up as soon as possible to serve more customers. You should NOT hear the waiter directing the bus girl on what she should know to do. Training is needed. After nearly an hour of waiting with two hungry kids and no communication, the waiter brought out some complimentary slightly warmed savory cheese pastry. That helped the kids feel a bit better. Then we were told a plate dropped so our food would be about 7 minutes. Then the food finally came and it was very tasty and sort of made up for the hour wait. Ribs (tender) burger, salmon (garlicky) and bbq wings (a little spicy). We enjoyed the food but to me, the bakery/dinner service seems like a mismatch. And tonight was a lot of screaming and crying toddlers in a tight space with moderately loud music which makes this place chaotic and not ideal for a nice family dinner. We did takeout for dessert because we had been there long enough.","The food here is good, but if I have to wait 6min for a coffee every time I come here, then it's worth no more than 3 stars.","Calling All Foodies, in the Queens area!The Spinach Feta pastry, combined with a small salad, is the Wiki/Fast Food that is trending NOW! Delish!","HALAL ALERT!!! This place is a gem hidden in the crowded neighborhood of Jackson Heights. Service was great! Seating was fast and food was served within in about 5-8 minutes. Farine is great for brunch, lunch or just a coffee date. The aesthetic is very minimal, which really allows you to focus on the food. Personal favorite is the Mango Pineapple Lemonade. It's more on the sweet side, but very refreshing. Tried the chicken club sandwich, which was a little messy to eat but it was delicious. The farine burger is a hit. Both are served with a side of French fries, which are fresh and perfectly salted. There's a wide variety of dessert, from cakes, pies, cupcakes, tarts, to cookies. Tried the chocolate crunch mousse, which was great, and coconut lemon mousse, which was more on the tart side. Can't wait to try more things!!!If you're driving there please know that you will most likely struggle for parking.","This place recently opened up in the neighborhood & looked like a place I definitely had to check out. .It's a cute bakery with a great variety of pastries, sweet treats, baked goods as well as savory food. .I heard about their spicy buttermilk fried chicken sandwich & how it's the best sandwich in queens so I wanted to try that ($16). I went in on Sunday around 430 & was told they stop serving all the savory food by 4pm. There was no sign about it so that was a little upsetting since I had my heart set on trying it. .I went back a couple of weeks later durning brunch & so glad to have gotten a chance to try it! It truly lived up to my expectations! It was worth every bite!.I also tried the Farine Burger $(16) which was Double patty, aged cheddar, caramelized onions, house made pickles, Farine sauce on a sesame brioche bun with a side of . Added beef bacon & egg to the burger at additional cost.This was by far one of Theeeee best burgers I've had thus far. I eat burgers from all kinds of places & prices but this one is definitely one of the top of the list! This burger is made medium which is perfect & everything on this burger compliments everything to bring you nothing but the best tasting burger  It's also HALAL along with everything else on the list! Worth every bite","This place recently opened up in the neighborhood I grew up in & looked like a place I definitely had to check out.

I got the chocolate chip cookie (I think it was $3) & the banana mouse cake which was $6. Chocolate chuck cookie was hard so I asked to have it warmed up. Didn't help much & was average tasting. The banana mouse cake was a good idea with a good consistency but too light on the banana flavor which made it seem watered down. I'll try to come back for the chicken sandwich.",Farine Baking Company
229,"I ordered 3 dishes- Chicken Mo:mo, Bhutan Samaibaji and Chicken Sukuti and I am disappointed with all three. It was a Door Dash order so by the time my food arrived the sauce from the Chicken Sukuti was spilled over the plastic bag because the lid was not closed properly and the taste was so-so. All I could taste was bland grilled meat. With the Bhutan Samaibaji I don't even know where to start, as far as I know Bhutan means fried intestines and liver but I was served with some weird chunks of meat which left me confused hence I had to check the menu once again to make sure that I ordered the correct thing and later I realized they were serving fried goat head and had named it ""Bhutan"", I am sorry but FRIED GOAT HEAD is not equivalent to Bhutan those are two completely different things, but do correct me if I am wrong. Also with the momo sauce all I got was a small container which wasn't even enough for the entire plate. This was my first Nepalese meal in NY and I am pretty sure you can find better places to try authentic Nepalese food than this. This has just been a total disappointment and I wouldn't really waste my money here.","Just ate lunch here and I already plan to go back in the near future. The place is a block off Roosevelt Avenue in a corner spot. A small casual joint with seating for about 12 people. I didn't know what to expect aside from seeing a couple food pics on Yelp, but decided to order the oft-pictured goat thali ($9) and was not disappointed. My friend ordered the pork version ($8), and we each ordered a mango lassi. The tender goat pieces were served bone-in, in an aromatic spicy stew base. The pork had a couple fattier pieces, was stewed in a similar base as the goat and was also superbly tender. The sides for the entree were curried potatoes with chickpeas, some type of buttery (mmmm) bean dhal, sautéed mustard greens, a creamy/spicy picked daikon, and a hot sauce. The lassi's were refreshing, not too thick, not too sweet, the color was very orange but I'm not sure if that was directly from the color of the mangos. It was a great accompaniment to the spiciness of the savory entree. Now this isn't a fancy place--you pay and order at the cashier in the front and take a seat where you can find one. But the service was attentive and accommodating. They came by periodically to check on us and also ask if we wanted refills of the side dishes. I can't wait to go back and try their other items!","Food is great. I recommend getting a Thali. They come around and refill the rice and veggies. The momos are a must. I prefer steamed over fried as the fried somehow loses its flavor a bit. The chow mein is solid. The only thing I didn't love was the beef chilly tingmo, because the beef was tough, but it was still very flavorful.",This is a little gem of good healthy food and a no frills type of restaurant. I come here quite often and usually will order the chicken momos or a vegetable thali plate. I absolutely love the customer service & super friendly staff. They make me feel at home. Love their food and it's very well priced! I feel so lucky to know this place!,"Bad customer Sevice, new waiters are super rude!!! Not welcome vibes. Me and my friends were a regular customers but from now, we will  never go again.Note: hired good waiters...,","Food was too spicy for my taste The meats were spicy I ordered the mango lassi and a big tray dish (chicken thali?)  that was good. My favorite was the steam bun, simple and sweet. 3.7/5It was open on a Saturday morning for brunch so that was nice. It had enough space for 7 people so that was cool. We wanted to be indoors cause it was so hot outside The service was nice! There was clean bathroom. Price was around $12 It was near the trains in Jackson height!",Lali Guras
230,This place has been there forever......I remember going there over 40 years ago.Great food and staff. Places like this are too far and few between but has been handed downthrough the years. Make it a point to visit when your in Corona Queens N.Y. or in Citifield.,"Just read an article about this deli in the NY Daily News and I was going to go today, but they r closed on Sunday. Hey everybody needs a day of rest. I'm going next Saturday to try Mama's Special and then I'm going to the bakery down the block and have the cappuccino with the biscotti. Can't wait. C u then.By the pics and reviews I'm a give it 5 stars because Yelp won't let me post without it, but I'm sure without even tasting anything from there it's a 5 star deli.The real taste test comes next Saturday. Again c u then.","Great tasting sandwiches, but they handle money and food with the same gloved hands. I always reheat my sandwiches from here but still got sick recently. =(","Finally made it to the source.I've been to their outposts at old Shea Stadium (field level behind home plate) and at Citi Field (field level, left field corner),  and I finally made to the original location in Corona. I was biking 32 miles around Flushing Meadows Corona Park and made a lunchtime detour to here. I'm glad I did.Old school Italian deli. The original deli counter is still in use. Even met Mama's granddaughter who now owns the place and lives on the second floor above the establishment. Nice friendly woman. $10 for a massive hero. A couple of outdoor tables to dine al fresco. Loved it. I will be back.","I love this place. It's a few blocks from my job and it's a wonderful walk in the spring or fall for a delicious sandwich. The mamas specials are bomb! But I am biased since living off salami and cheese are my goals in life. The sandwich usually consists of salami, ham, fresh mozzarella. You walk in and all the cheese hanging off the ceiling makes the most delicious smell, as if you've been wrapped in a blanket of cheese and might walk outside and be in Italy. The lunch specials are really good too. Their stuffed shells and chicken parm are also good!Another plus is you can always buy fresh cut salami or cheeses and a bunch of other goods from Italy.","Citi Field offers tons of food options from the classic ballpark foods like burgers and fries all the way through Pat LaFrieda steaks. One of my go to options when taking in a ballgame is the classic ""Mama's Special"" at Mama's of Corona (also knows as Leo's Latticini). Their signature sandwiches have long been a staple in Corona but have made their way to Mets games as well. Their special includes Pepper Ham, Salami, Homemade Fresh Mozzarella, Mushrooms and Peppers within a Toasted Sesame Hero. You can grab one of these bad boy's in Section 105 or 415 at the stadium or at their storefront location on 104th Street in Corona. Play ball!",Leo's Latticini Mama's
231,"I would like to start off by saying their service is good, we arrived at 7 PM on a Saturday night and were greeted and got seated within 10 minutes. The restaurant itself is spacious but you can still hear others talk but I didn't really mind it much.As for food I ordered two types of curry, Massaman and Green. As a curry person, I thoroughly enjoyed them however if you do not like sweet curry I would not recommend ordering them. Their Pad See Ew was good but it's not that hard to mess up this noodle dish but still good. The last order my sister decided to order under their Grilled section, ""Grilled Tender of Beef"" and boy was it disappointing. They literally served us 6 pieces of sliced steak that was pan-fried with a side of papaya salad no bigger than my palm and cold sticky rice for $17.  I will not order items off their Grilled section and stick to their noodles and curry. Other than that disappointment come here for your Thai food cravings!","Painstakingly small portions.Let me go over the amount of protein in each dish I got for take out:Pad kreaw pan with seafood- 3 pieces of shrimp, a couple rings of squid and 2 pieces of mussels.

($25!!)Sizzling eggplant- $13 for literally one .I was terribly annoyed at my diasterous decision to give BKNY another try after all these years.",The food and service is both good. The atmosphere is quiet and dark. Only con is they no longer serve two of my favs. The grilled squid and coconut ice cream.,"Went on a date here last week and I  must say that I was loved the atmosphere! Staff very welcoming and accommodating, they smiled and continued to ask if we were ok. We were happy with our seats and they moved us as soon as a table of our choice was available.

232,"I'm giving it two stars because of the inadequate service plus the hair that was found in a dish. Yea, not appetizing!Came in here because of the four stars from previous postings. We decided to order the steamed tiny crab meat and pork soup dumplings. I've had better soup dumplings like at Joe Shanghai's. Also ordered two cold dishes which was the wine chicken, the szechuan style wonton, jelly fish, and white rice. The hair was found in the wonton dish. I mean they replaced the dish, but maybe they could've compensated us instead?? That completely threw me off. The szechuan style threw me off too since it wasn't spicy at all. I doubt I'll be coming here again after this experience.","We wanted to try another dim sum restaurant out in Queens and we stumbled upon Shanghai. Little did we know they were only open for about 8 days. The place was fairly busy. I'm assuming it is because of the hype of a new Asian restaurant in the neighborhood. I ordered the spring rolls, the crab and pork soup dumplings and he ordered a beef noodle soup. The rolls came out and they were hot. The flavor was a standard spring roll. Then the dumplings came out and I have to say that usually when you get soup dumplings they are piping hot. These not so much. I didn't want to say anything as it took a while for them to come out. Not really a biggie, I understand that they are new and are just getting their groove on about timing and delivery of the food items. Then he tried his soup. Now, this is where I have to be negative. I kid you not the flavor tasted like a beef soup from campbell's soup in a can. It was horrible. If I wanted to get campbell's soup I would go to the store and pay $3 instead of $9-ish. Final thoughts: good luck.","Great dumplings. Everything else was mediocre or bad. The service was overbearing and made us uncomfortable.  And, when I explained that the squid was undercooked, I was told to bite it harder and then was brought a knife (for which I did not ask) and told to cut it.","Came here on a weeknight and a lot of the tables were occupied when we came in at around 8pm.  Ordered the crab meat soup dumpling- it's delicious!! A lot of crab meat were in the dumpling!!! And Not only u can taste it but u could also smell the taste of the crab meat! And later on , they told us due to a lack of ingredients one of the dish we ordered was cancelled and we ordered the black truffle dumpling - it was delicious tooo!!  The only thing that disappointed us was their pork chop- it was deep fried but was over cooked so it became chewy and dry when it was served.  Overall will I come back? Yes!!","I wish I could give them more stars  !! Exceptional service and great quality food in Elmhurst, Queens! I believe The best soup dumplings are here and not at Chinatown. What my boyfriend and I ordered below...1. Pork soup dumplings and crab and pork soup dumplings. WOW! Beautifully made with thin dough so much meat and broth. I love love love thin dough in soup dumplings because it doesn't get overwhelming after awhile. It was so good we ordered three trays of it.2. Shumai- 6 HUGE pieces packed with pork and shrimp. Quality is so much better than any other dim sum place you go to in Chinatown. 3. Szhecuan spicy wontons- drenched in oil sauce, smothered in goodness schezuan. A mixture of spiciness and sweetness. 4. Shrimp dumplings (4 pieces) my boyfriend's favorite. Solid choice for dim sum here as well.I'm beyond thrilled about finding this place. I wanted dim sum somewhere in queens and we happened to find this place through yelp and saw  such amazing reviews on this place we had to check it out for ourselves. This will be my go to place from now on for soup dumplings and dim sum! We will have to try other entrees there. Everything we had ordered were solid.

Food came out fast and delicious.","I'm so happy there is a soup dumpling place in Elmhurst! I've been here twice and both times their service has been so nice and attentive. Food was great. We got the crab & pork soup dumpling -- a must in any xiao long bao place. Very nicely done, decent amount of soup. We also got scallion pancakes -- I'm not the biggest fan of scallion but it could have used more. It was very crispy but not enough flavor without the scallion. I love rice cakes so we got their Shanghai rice cake with pork. Loved it! These three items made for a very filling dinner for 2. We left happy and full.

233,"As far as greasy diner burgers go, it doesn't get much better. I got a regular burger with bacon and cheddar. My cousin got an omelette. We were in the mood to eat so we also got a blueberry pancake. 3 entrees between 2 hungry people? Yeah we got that.Except.We don't got that. The burger was humongous. It's not just the size. It's greasy as well. On top of all that, I think aged meats sit a heavier in my stomach. As much as I was enjoying my meal, between the pancakes and the burger, I couldn't finish my food. It's a shame because I thought the pancakes were pretty good too but at some point the law of negative returns starts kicking in.","I'm not the type of person to leave a one star review for a business, even if my food sucks.

Not spending money there again.","They've been around awhile.  This diner is well known around Queens and has a 50s-retro vibe/theme.  The breakfast here (bacon/eggs/home fries) was very good but overpriced and they sneak extra charges for bacon and such.  Also charging more for an iced coffee vs. regular coffee in the Summer is not right.  The waiters also didn't bring water on a hot summer day.  The management needs to get it together or else it's adios, since the restaurant business is tough and fickle.","Not bad! Such a quaint place. Still have that old diner feel rather than that modern diner.So many options just like all diners. They are known for their burgers, they are so large I'm afraid to order them and not finish. It would be just a waste.They have so many fries options and they were all good. Not amazing but not bad for a diner. Fish and chips were okay, the fish was under seasoned and a bit over cooked. Service and quick and staff is friendly. I've been back a few times already.","Jackson hole is like your favorite show, whether it's a rerun or still on the air, it is consistent and has never let me down. Humongous burgers, amazing breakfast options, although it's what a restaurant is suppose to be it's not your ordinary diner.Whoever Angelina is, she had the best idea for cinnamon raisin/cream cheese stuffed French toast with strawberries and blueberries on top. Hence the name Angelina style French toast. Their combination of mushrooms onions and cheese along with bacon is coded into the word Baldini, also a delightful combination in an omelette or on top of the burger.Their waffles are fluffy and crispy and go amazing with anything else, in my opinion: fried chicken! Enjoy everything on this menu even the chicken fingers Parmesan will have you questioning how Parmesan is supposed to be made.","Love this place for their humongous burgers and parking lot. Setting for a scene in the movie GOOD FELLAS, The Jackson Hole in Astoria is a sure thing. Great breakfast, lunch and dinner options. Quick and friendly staff and have I mentioned their parking lot? They oblige to keto-friendly options by subtracting the bun from your burger, but ither than that, this burger/breakfast joint is pretty simple and self-explanatory. AN NYC Classic landmark.",Jackson Hole
234,Consistent quality and filling. I stuck to my normal beef rib ramen and left completely satisfied. So much meat. It's the ideal dish for any carnivore. I've tried several other dishes as well but always felt a tinge of regret and hunger as I'd leave the premises.TL;DR: Get the beef rib ramen.,"Self serve station with lemon water, hot tea, chopsticks and all? I think yes!The moment I walked into this restaurant with my family after a long day, it immediately reminded me of China and its restaurants. It gave a very homey feeling.We ordered a Tonkatsu, Sheng Ramen, Dumplings, Beef Ramen, and Braised pork over rice. Instead of a Taiwanese feeling/touch to it, it reminded me of a Japanese styled dish. The ramen is the typical ramen you get at a Japanese restaurant. I personally ordered A1- the Sheng Ramen. It was spicy. For someone who can take spice, I felt like I couldn't enjoy the noodles as much as I wanted to because it was burning hot. I wouldn't really recommend unless you're really into the whole ma-la dishes.As for the prices, I'd say it is fairly overpriced. For a bowl of noodles and as a quick eat, I don't think it's worth it. You could definitely find something cheaper elsewhere.","Service: Self-serviceQuantity: GoodCleanliness: FairFood: Tonkotsu Ramen $10Trying a new spot for lunch, and I was in the mood for some Ramen then came across Sheng Ramen. You need to pay attention to the arrow sign posted on the wall which pointed to the direction of the restaurant. There are few restaurants and a dessert restaurant in the same areas. A bit tough to see through before entering.Not very busy during lunchtime, and not too sure if we can sit down ourselves or wait to be seated. A lady came out and guide us to a table. You will need to order at the cashier and pay first. Self-service on hot tea /iced water and condiment.  Food came out quick, I had a Tonkotsu Ramen which I should of pay attention in Chinese translation since it stated soup served with white noodles, not Japanese Ramen. I don't recall if it was written in English so I suggest asking the cashier prior to ordering if you don't read Chinese. Pork bone broth was tasty and pork belly was tender. Beside the white noodles was not I expected, all in all, it was pretty good. I guess this is a Taiwanese style of Tonkotsu.","I give food for 5 stars because it is very delicious and authentic taiwanese food! For service, I give them 2 stars!!  Recently, they have changed policy from non-tip to have- to- for tips!!! We have to go the counter order our food, take our own water just like in the fast food restaurant. At the end, they ask us to pay for tips which make me feel unhappy!!!  In my opinion, if you want us to pay tips you should have full-service..Again we come here very often, but since this service policy has changed, we may not come here often like before.","A few friends and I came here after a Yelp Elite event that served only light bites. We were seated immediately and given menus with plenty of photographs of the food on it, which I always appreciate. To order, you need to go to the counter, pay up front and the server will give you a number then bring the food to you once it is ready.The place is known for their ramen, but I didn't feel like getting that so I decided on the pork katsu with curry rice. I also picked the scallion pancake with beef to share. Since my order was over $15, I was able to get a free tea. There were 3 types of iced tea and I tried some of my friend's red tea. I enjoyed the mild flavor, even though the staff recommended the winter melon tea since it is the sweetest one. After I tried the winter melon tea, I immediately wanted that one even though I had already gotten the other type of tea. Thankfully, the staff was understanding and generously let me have the winter melon tea. I wasn't a fan of the scallion pancakes with beef. The pancakes were a little thick and not as crispy as I like them. Also, there weren't a ton of green onions throughout. The beef was kind of bland and quite fatty. My main meal was tasty though. The pork katsu had a drizzle of savory dark brown sauce which went well with the meat. The pork was perfectly crunchy, tender and juicy. There was a flavorful curry sauce over the rice and quite a bit of corn, as well as lettuce that I mixed with the rice. The service was really good. The people who worked there were really friendly, nice, and made great recommendations. I would come back to try their namesake: Ramen!",We came here for dinner on Sat night.  We were welcomed by a lovely grandmother.  Food was decent.  The best part of this meal was that the place was not over crowded!! We actually were able to enjoy our meal in a peaceful environment where did not feel rushed.,勝面 Sheng Ramen
235,"Cheap, good, nice space, and they dont kid around about things being spicy! but lowkey I think they lied about the meat being halal :( and the server kept stealing the sauces on our table to give to others and we had to ask for cups of water which is weird...giving four stars for taste and cost mostly.","I'm not sure if I'm missing something but the Lhasa fried noodles literally taste like Lo mein but spicy. There really wants any flavor to the noodles, beside it being spicy. I've had spicy food that have lots of flavor, but these weren't it. The small restaurant upstairs has cheaper prices than the bigger one across (which I find silly). Service was fast, you see the cooks making everything to order. Maybe I'll need to try another dish next time. The price is also wrong in the pictures posted. The noodles are 8.99.",It looks fine. Clean and tidy place. Lots of photos on the menu. This is for the same name restaurant across the street. Ground floor. Their food IS FULL WITH MSG !!!!!!!!!!!!!Not good. They should tell their customers. Because some cannot tolerate it. My friend cannot. He is allergic. He ate a dish there. And has all the symptoms. The food tastes good because of msg. But it can be expired or junk or leftovers. Bad restaurant. Never again.,"You know, I have to admit a failing in my personality - I am particularly poor when it comes to delivering good news.  As an eternal cynic, I just cannot convey good news to anyone without a qualifier, since I simply do not believe in the idea of an unspoiled virtue.  When I proposed to my wife 3 years ago part of my ridiculous internal pitch to her was that it would provide immense tax benefits to the both of us and we'll save on rent significantly, but she would have to put up with my snoring.  My wife said yes, but she was sold on that entire ""funny soulmate who will never let me eat crappy food"" angle..  Yeah, she's a bit gullible.  That said, Phayul is the best Tibetan restaurant in Jackson Heights, but there are qualifiers.Qualifier A - you better go an hour before dining hours or you'll be stuck on that staircase waiting for a possibly shared table, and the prime waiting spot will be outside their unisex restroom.  It's also cash-only.  If you are so inclined their new second location across 37th Road (right in front of the Amdo food truck) have multiple unisex restrooms and will take credit cards, so send that Citi Rewards Costco VISA and your white friends with kids-in-strollers that-a-way (and they won't have to schleppe it up the stairs).  This location is Frontier/Spirit, the one downstairs is JetBlue.  Got it?  Qualifier B - The original location has an open kitchen, and if you are a party of 2 you'll be on a table situated next to it, and sometimes you don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth.  They do leave pieces of parcooked meats on the work surface next to the veggies, which is close to the woman making momo on the other side of the prep table.  You also see all the canisters of Chinese sauces, vinegars and flavoring agents.  If you want to be isolated from the food safety violations, the one downstairs have an enclosed kitchen and a nice bar countertop.Qualifier C - you might want to re-read the menu, and do some research on what you are ordering.  This location do not have the picture menu of their fancier second location downstairs, and the staff here have questionable English conversational skills.  Make sure you look things up on Yelp first- e.g: the beef soup with Tibetan mountain herbs is called Tsak Sha La Kor Hot, don't be like me and ask for a bowl of ""Sexual LaWhore Hot""...this is not Sean Connery on Celebrity Jeopardy here.  That Tibetan mountain herb is called wild lavender.  The soup contains a mix of chili peppers, szechuan peppercorns and lavender, which is like the napalm version of herbs de Provence, which is to say ""fairly good"".  The second location downstairs have generally the same items plus a few extras, but due to the bigger dining room, the more comfy chairs, climate controls and staff who can explain what they are selling to you, pricing on items run about 10-15% more in that location.  When dining with wife, do it here.  When taking the girlfriend, side chick or the swipe-right-for-the-night, hit the joint downstairs.  Qualifier D - the chicken thenthuk is excellent here, as are their Lhasa fried starches.  However, their fried momos are a tactical weapon meant to launch hot juices upon the faces of opposing dining guests when you bite them.  Don't worry, they are cheap and you won't enjoy them much anyways as their momos are kinda meh, but it's fine dining with people you don't like.  Anyways, the big question is whether you want to save a few bucks and hit the upstairs Phayul, or go downstairs for the one that is more comfortable and accepts credit cards and health inspectors.  My answer?  Yes.  You can't go wrong with either.","I have to admit a failing in my personality - I am particularly poor when it comes to delivering good news.  As an eternal cynic, I just cannot convey good news to anyone without a qualifier, since I simply do not believe in the idea of an unspoiled virtue.  When I proposed to my wife 3 years ago part of my ridiculous internal pitch to her was that it would provide immense tax benefits to the both of us and we'll save on rent significantly, but she would have to put up with my snoring.  My wife said yes, but she was sold on that entire ""soulmate who will never let me eat crappy food"" angle rather than my cocky stride, musty odors and inability to deliver good news without a put-down or 2 on the side.  And by the same token, eh, Phayul is the best Tibetan restaurant in Jackson Heights, but there are qualifiers.Qualifier A - you better go an hour before peak hours or you'll be stuck on that staircase outside the 2nd floor restaurant waiting for a table (there's only around 10 tables in total), and the prime waiting spot will be outside their unisex restroom.  It's also cash-only, so put that Citi Rewards Costco VISA Card away because it's no good here.Qualifier B - it's an open kitchen, and if you are a party of 2 you'll be situated next to it, and sometimes you don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth.  They do leave pieces of parcooked meats on the work surface next to the veggies, which is close to the woman making momo on the other side of the prep table.  You also see all the canisters of Chinese sauces, vinegars and flavoring agents.  You do get a pretty good idea of the insane firepower driving their wok, so your stir fry is legit.  Qualifier C - you might want to re-read the menu, and do some research on what you are ordering.e.g: the beef soup with Tibetan mountain herbs is called Tsak Sha La Kor Hot, don't be like me and say ""hey, can I get a bowl of Sexual LaWhore Hot?"" to the waitress. This is not Sean Connery on Celebrity Jeopardy.  BTW, that Tibetan mountain herb is wild lavender and can be found in copious amounts throughout Eastern Tibet.  The soup contains a mix of chili peppers, szechuan peppercorns and lavender, and it's like the hard-ass version of herbs de Provence.  I don't find it spicy at all, and during a cold day it's comforting like a smelly quilt on your bed with a snoozing cat on top.  Of course, you might not want to let your Asian girlfriend know about it, she might want you to drive her to a certain lavender farm out on the North Fork of Long Island to ""buy it fresh"".  It's okay, just casually drive away without her.  Qualifier D - the chicken thenthuk is excellent here, as are their Lhasa fried starches and laphing.  However, their momos are a tactical weapon.  When it was steamed the juices can burn your tongue.  When it is deep fried and you bite into it, the juices will launch from the other side like a massive pimple, burning the diner opposite you.  Just a fair word of warning, their momo isn't that great compared to others in the area, but it is fun for the sadist or the masochist in your family.  So yeah, great place.  Too bad it's so small they tend to be mobbed.  The plan is to move across the street later this year, but until that happens, show up an hour early.","This is a very low key Tibetan restaurant on the second floor of a walk up. You will have to see past all the not so fancy decor and limited number of seats. It is an amazing restaurant once you ignore the above. I went back many times since my first visit two years ago. I also took different people there with me. They were all very impressed. It has a small but open kitchen. One waitress/cashier. Just keep an open mind with the food. It is cultural and authentic. I like it because the food gives me the feeling of a Tibetan home cooking especially I see Tibetans eating here. I like that they have meat lovers dishes as well as vegetarian dishes or even vegan. Veggie potato momos are good. They have vegetarian noodles (fried or in soup). They are very good too. If you love meat, try their beef tongue appetizer. Their stir fried meat dishes are very yummy too. Don't let the menu intimidates you. I still don't remember everything on the menu but you should always feel free to ask. The staff is very friendly.",Phayul
236,The guys from work go here often and times I've gotten sausage and peppers a few times and it's tasteless. Plus the sausage always tastes dried out. I add salt and pepper Whenever I make my own in a grill or frying pan and it never tastes as bland as this does.,hidden at the Home Depot. A must stop for anyone wanting to Philly cheesesteak. The bread is so soft and yummy.,"Been coming here for years, surprised they were open today on Easter Sunday and got my usual.Best Italian Sausage ever!!!",One of the better philly cheese steaks I've had in NY. The 4.5 average is an accurate rating for this place. I definitely recommend it if you're in the area.CASH ONLY.,"There's a difference between ""good service"" and ""employees having a good time and enjoying themselves."" I really don't care about the former -- a fancy restaurant with stiff and well-dressed wait staff can just as easily make me feel uncomfortable -- but when the latter is lacking, it really ruins the meal.At Rocco's the employees are bantering and happy whenever I go, the sandwiches are fresh, and they'll throw in a bag of chips or a piece of hot sausage just to make your day better. Good portions and a better cheesesteak than I've ever had on the West Coast.","Their grilled onions make the Home Depot parking lot smell amazing. This is pretty much the main reason I go to Home Depot haha. I've had the Philly cheese steak and the sweet Italian sausage.The Philly cheese steak wasn't as oily as I'm used to. That could be either a good or bad thing, depending on how you look at it. It doesn't feel as unhealthy and you get the full flavor or the meat, but on the other hand, the lack of oil made it kinda dry but that can be fixed by adding ketchup or mustard to it.The sweet Italian sausage was juicy and sweet, as the name says. They also have a spicy version of this.Service is usually quick and even the small sized subs provide a good portion. They're cash only and there's no seating, unless you count the outdoor tables. You can stand by the counters at the window and eat your food, if you'd prefer to stay in the restaurant.",Rocco's Italian Sausages & Philly Cheese Steaks
237,"Ordered off their pre-fix lunch menu for Christmas Day.  Regular menu was not offered so cannot comment on that (never been to La Vigna before).Menu offerings were pretty basic considering it was a holiday (place was busy by the way), and I had a hard time deciding on what to order---and not because the choices were overwhelming or sounded too-good, either.  More of a ""ok I have to choose SOMETHING"" kind of feeling.  Settled on the Mussels Fra Diavolo appetizer and Rib-eye Steak with Wild Mushrooms for the main course.  Red Sangria to drink.Mussels were bland, small, and barely any sauce.  Steak was large but extremely fatty, and undercooked (I asked for medium-well and got *barely* above rare).  Service, while polite during any interaction, was also very sparse and inattentive which is why I didn't bother sending back the steak to be re-fired....I figured by the time I was able to flag down our actual waiter, AND get my dish back, the rest of the table would be nearly finished eating.  Sangria was bitter---tasted as though it were made with a low-quality wine. Highlight of the evening was the chocolate-almond tartufo.  At least I *think* that's what it was called....Here, let me explain: When we asked for the dessert menu (yeah the meal was not that great but it WAS Christmas Day, so why not have dessert)...we were told the restaurant doesn't have a dessert menu and the waiter spouted off about 8 different dessert choices in about 1.2 seconds flat.  Add in a noisy restaurant and his mumbled voice, was not easy to catch them all.  He was quite annoyed when we politely asked if he could repeat them (there were 5 of us at the table).  So I had the tartufo but not sure if it was almond or hazelnut to be quite honest.  It was tasty though.  Sadly, a tartufo is not enough to bring me back, or, recommend this restaurant.  Quite a disappointment.   Especially for a holiday meal.","To whom it may concern;Yesterday luncheon was a complete disaster,  have visit your place few times.But yesterday was a joke.Certain things we picked  was not available:Fried calamari, Osobucco, why keep dishes on the menu if they're not available?After we made our choice the food was cool, my potatoes were cold, veggies  look warm, for shrimp appetizer you charged  $15 for four shrimps!! Fillet of soul stuffed with crab meat was a mush on the plate, the fish must've been frozen and it fell apart when you were preparing it.You have to shape up!!!Me you have lost as a customer, plus I was embarrassed by my quests, who came from Manhatta.Eugenia","We dine here every December for our union meeting/holiday celebration and it's a very nice choice for such a get together. The food is delicious, with four options in two courses soup, salad, fried and crusted mozzarella and mussels for appetizers. And tilapia, ravioli, chicken parm or chicken francese for entrees. They take a long time to prepare the yummy food but it's worth the wait. The only drawback for a large gathering that we have is the looooong tables which don't allow for great socializing. But the restaurant is long and thin too so there's no choice.","I've been here twice, once four years ago for a friend's birthday celebration, and once recently for a lunch with my girlfriend.  Both times had excellent food with some of the best sauces I've ever enjoyed.On my most recent visit, we ordered from the pre-fixe lunch menu ($18 each).  You get to choose an appetizer and a main course-- and we also chose an appetizer from the specials list in addition to the lunches we ordered.  Total lunch: fresh mozzarella with a fresh scallion/basil/tomato salad and olive oil/balsamic vinegar dressing, mussels fra diavolo, a ceasar salad, chicken francese, and chicken cacciatore.Every one of these was excellent.  The mozzarella was fresh and apparently made in house; the ceasar salad was thankfully lightly dressed, fresh, and sprinkled with cheese (but not overly impressive); the mussels tasted as they should and the sauce was worth using the rest of the bread basket to sop up the juices.  The chicken cacciatore had a delicious chunky tomato sauce (though I would have preferred more dark meat).  The chicken francese had a rich butter-lemon sauce.  Both entrees came with a few browned roasted potato chunks.I'd really give a 4.5 as the prices are relatively high, but if you like the food, the place is a good choice for special or romantic occasions.  They also have a good wine list if you want some with your meal-- I didn't have any this trip but did the last time.","First time going and was very amazed, I made reservations so we were seated immediately. The food came in a decent time and tasted very good. The portion sizes were perfect. However, it's was difficult to understand all the specials they had for the evening. Maybe put it on the menu or on a piece of paper. Would come back again !","La Vigna is one of my favorite places to go to for lunch on weekdays. They have a great deal for lunch special which is an appetizer and entree for $17. The lunch special is a pre-fixed menu with 8 selections for appetizers and 10 selections for entrees. Their appetizers are ok - I've had the eggplant rollatini and mussels fra diavolo before, nothing special. I love their chicken francese (basic, I know), and usually add on a side of pasta for $7.50.Service is a little slow during lunch hour, but that is expected.",La Vigna Restaurant
238,Some of the worst Italian food Ive had especially for the prices.Broccoli rabe and sausage was drenched in sauce and ended up water logged. Same with the linguine clam sauce white.,I will never go back here again! Had me waiting for over 50 minutes when I was told the wait would be only 30 minutes. Several people walked in after my boyfriend and I and were seated right away!,Food is a bit better than average  BUT Nowhere in the league of Parkside..................,Amazing food. A+ service. Beautiful Atmosphere.Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Queens.Burrata was fresh delicious. Fried calamari was perfect and tender. Veal parmigiana was the best ever. I cannot wait to be back.,"Found this spot on my birthday Thursday, July 11 after we saw Dees on Metropolitan was closed. We just beat the rain and they seated us right away at about 6:45p even as walk-ins. They had music/singer strolling around the place which was a nice touch as he upstaged the sports on the TVs above and around the place.Waiter seemed to rush to get our order as soon as we sat down without a hello, or mentioning specials or pouring water.  The food, drink and ambiance would eventually make up for his lack of a table side manner.  We first ordered Espresso and Pina Colada Martinis followed by Margherita pizza and Caesar Salad.  Delicious. We then ordered Penne Pasta and Salmon. Mmmm. The place started to fill up more and more until we left about 8:15p. I would try this place again hopefully another server with some warmth.","I really don't want to give this restaurant three stars as the food was outstanding, but I can't see giving it any more given that the service was very poor.I went in with a large party after attending a funeral. Our party was so large that we had to sit at three different tables. The tables were in the same vicinity but split apart in a way that we were not able to converse with each other without getting up and visiting each table. I would have hoped that this would allow for better service but this was not the case. And being that we were such a large party I could see this as being overwhelming, but we walked in on a Saturday afternoon when there was barely anyone there. Not to say that anyone was mean or rude in any way. It's just we hardly saw the wait staff. It took FOREVER to get our drinks. And forget about getting refills...We only saw the wait staff when food was being brought to the table and being cleared away. Although some would have viewed the lack of interaction as giving us time to spend with our friends and family uninterrupted. But no ever checked in to see how we were doing, ever. On the flip side - the food was incredible. Let's start with the bread/garlic knots that were brought to the table. I am very particular with my garlic knots and these had just the right amount of garlic and oil that could soak up any plate of sauce (yes we did order another round just for that). Our apps included stuffed mushrooms and baked clams. A nice helping for each order and both equally delicious. The following course was a bowl of pasta with a sauce that could battle my mothers. My main dish was a tilapia oreganata. The fish was light and flaky and the sauce was not oily in the slightest. I would love to try this place with not such a large group in hopes that an intimate setting would grant me better service.   I would love to grab a meal from them once more and maybe add another star to a future review.",Barosa
239,"The service is absolutely horrendous here. Not worth the extremely average food. I always try to dissuade people from coming here because it is never enjoyable, but for some reason people insist on brunch here.One person in my party ordered a salad with shrimpInstead of chicken. They got it wrong 3 times and we had to wait very long to get the (what ended up being wrong anyway) dish.","I was excited to try this place cause the happy hour looked really promising and the food looked tasty. First disappointment though was that the menu on their website is not the one in the restaurant so that was a little confusing...they also don't serve gyro for dinner ‍The food itself was not bad, the roasted cauliflower on the happy hour menu was amazing and was the silver lining of the whole meal. What made me give two stars, however, was the service. As the server brought our drinks he dropped a glass of sangria which fell on her lap and shattered everywhere on her and the floor. Thank goodness our dog was on my side or he would have been hit with shards of glass! We were quite calm about it; my mother and I work in the service industry and mistakes happen. The glass also got into our food and he quickly replaced it and apologized. But for such a large mistake to be made, no manager was around to do damage control of the situation and they didn't even comp the drinks or the food that was ruined. It might not seem like much but if my mother had made a scene I feel like a different reaction would have occurred.  Also while eating, we noticed people around us were frustrated of the slow service and how it took over 10 minutes to get simple drinks.This place has potential but lacks the fundamentals of customer service and it was quite dissapointing.","I have heard nice things about Tru so went for lunch today. After ordering one black coffee and one unsweetened tea, my friend and I waited 15 minutes while suffering through a nearby patron chainsmoking in the outdoor section. Our drinks never came despite the waitress walking past us several times (as well as the chain smoker - she said nothing about it). Famished and parched, we could no longer tolerate the vile cigarettes and an oblivious waitress and left. We went across the street and were served in under 5 minutes. Rude. Very disappointing. Will not return.",I have been here on two separate occasions for brunch. A reservation is definitely needed on the weekends. The food has been great both times ! And the unlimited mimosos? No complaints ! Loved the place,"This place is great for boozy brunch - but that's about it. Their bottomless brunch price is decent ($18 for 2 hrs - mimosas, Bellini, sangria, Bloody Mary). All of their main brunch dishes will be about ~$20. So if you're going for boozy brunch and eating a full meal, expect to pay about ~$50 per person including tip (which I think is somewhat reasonable since you're also drinking). However, this place has changed a LOT since it opened. I used to really like this place (outside of their brunch offer). But one time I went  in the evening and was told that coffee is not served after 7pm. Since when does a Greek cafe not serve coffee after 7pm? It's pretty common that Greeks (and other Europeans) go out to cafes in the evening and drink coffee - why else would people go to a cafe if they can't be served coffee??  I thought that was pretty ridiculous and not sure why management would forego potential profits all because they don't wanna serve coffee at night. Maybe they're trying to not be seen as just a ""cafe""? But even restaurants serve coffee with dessert after people have had their dinner so it just makes zero sense to me. Their dinner menu is okay, still think brunch has the most interesting/tasty dishes. But in all, the food is whatever. Another thing that really bugged me about this place is how expensive a glass of wine is! A friend of mine ordered a glass of wine and it came out to $15! She didn't even order anything special either! I looked at the menu again and saw that pretty much all of their wines are $15!! Why so expensive? I understand that Astoria is hot right now and Ditmars is gaining some traction but we are not in Manhattan!!! Stop charging Manhattan prices when you're literally located across a previous bodega.","This place is perfect for pretty much anything. You want to grab a couple of drinks? The bar is huge! You want to have a hearty dinner? They have delicious meals and most are pretty healthy. Want dessert? Their crepes are great! You want to have your baby shower, graduation celebration, birthday dinner, etc. at a sit down place? Give them a call! They're more than accommodating! You can dress up or down for this place. The staff has always been super pleasant every time that I've gone. A manager will usually walk up to you at some point and ask how everything is. They have awesome deals too:*Mon-Fri from 4-7pm they have drinks from $5-6! *Brunch on Sat and Sun where you have $15 bottomless drinks for two hours! Highly recommend Tru!",Tru Astoria
240,"1. Food: hot dog was uncooked in the middle. They gave me another one but that one was uncooked as well. They still charged me for it.  2. Service: two servers in their twenties. The guy server with glasses was drinking wine and the girl server thought this was a karaoke. Singing along EVERY SINGLE songs.... 3. Cleanliness: Burner was covered with spilled ddukbbokki soup. 4 unmarked sauce bottles on the table was sticky. Bathroom's waste basket was Soo full it was spilling to the floor.Overall, food was mediocre and the service can be better. I was surprised with such a high rating on Yelp.

As I walked in, I realized that I have to try the DIY ddukbbokki (since it smelled great) and most tables were eating it. I was too occupied with eating the donkatsu that I let the ddukbbokki noodle sit for too long :( I was sad that I wasn't able to get fried rice at the end as well, so I will be back to try it!FYI, they have the set menu for chicken feet which I will let you know after I try it!","I always crave myungrang hotdog from downtown LA in California and unfortunately we don't have one in NYC. I was looking into it and found that there was a store in Flushing called Basac that sold these Korean corn dogs!I came here a prior a couple times before giving this review. Although I give five stars, I wouldn't say that their food is spectacular. It's kind of mediocre. I tried their ddeukboki, and fire chicken. The ddeukboki was just OK and the fire chicken was good and cheesy. The corn dogs were kind of a let down but it did hit the spot for my craving so it's okay! The corn dog though, had a LOT of bread and it was kind of just like eating the bread at one point. The hot dog was thinner compared to the ones I had in LA and the cheese was sparse. But like I said, it still hit the spot!The size of the restaurant is just medium. There's tables and seating and it's rather clean. The staff are friendly and nice too, which always helps.",Katsu & tempura are fresh and crispyTtukpokki tastes like what I used to have in koreaPortion is pretty bigGood vibes,"This place is farrr from basac ;DWhat seems like your run of the mill korean foods like spicy tteokbokki, KorenFC, fried pork cutlets stuffed with the cheese, spicy chicken skillets, kimbap, and cheesy fried corn dogs, the Basac does it so well.The tteokbokki was spicy, hot, and flavorful, the spicy chicken skillet with the cheese was hot juicy and cheesy, and the fried pork cutlet, oh it was soooo good. That stuffed cheese was dripping out and with the curry along with it, perfection. The boneless soy garlic fried chicken was also really good, very crunchy and sticky with sauce all evenly coated. The corn dog was crunchy and had that classic cheese pull (good for a boomerang shot for he gram) and the kimbap was solid. This is a great spot for dinner, or a place to sober up after a few drinks. All in all, awesome place to eat!",The Basac
241,"Food is great!!!i have been coming to Pio Pio in Woodhaven for over 10 years and the price in the last few years has sky rocketed. Very sad that the ower is not being considerate to his customers and has raised the prices so muchBye, bye pio pio i will miss you.Pollo Mario here we come. Great food and half the price!!!","Terrible!Its been a few years since I have eaten here.  I am a local and live in the neighborhood. I ordered a Matador ($42) for dinner for my family (Wife, 5 yo, & 1 yo) and I yesterday evening.  The tostones, beans, and the potatoes in the salchipapas all had the same foul taste of soapy dish water.  Very disappointing and upsetting to come home, sit down with the kids, serve them, and discover foul tasting food.It was my wife's first tasted of Pio Pio and her last.  We will never be buying food from this place ever again.  Stay away.","Attitude is served cold, Poor service and a complete let down! The woman at the service desk was rude, impatient and unhelpful! Stay away. Just cash? Losing business here","I went to Pio Pio with a friend to order take out. I hadn't been inside this location. It's smaller. More intimate. I decided to go with the meal that came with chicken, rice, beans, hotdogs and French fries, tostones and salad. I waited about 10 minutes and it was piping hot as soon as it came out. I ordered extra green sauce (Large size for $6) and it was worth it.  The meal came with 3 small green sauce containers. I used the large one all week. The chicken was tender and flavorful. The rice had diced peppers and was perfect with the beans. The salad with great and the garlic sauce I put onto that. It was easily enough food for 3-4 people and we had lots of leftovers. I would definitely order out again. And yes, get the extra green sauce!","I've never came here to sit down and eat because I know it will get messy when I eat chicken. Also, the space is very tiny. Pio Pio is known for their chicken. Its surprisingly juicy. You know that dry chicken that you get at some restaurants? Pio Pio is the opposite of that, its extremely flavorful and moist.As if the chicken wasn't enough just by itself without any additional seasoning, they do give you green sauce. This Pio Pio has been around for over 15 years. People would ask me if I had ever tried it and they'd be surprised such an amazing place is in the middle of a very residential area. Pio pio is so successful they do have other locations but since this is the first one I have found, I haven't had a need to try the other locations. Call ahead so you don't need to wait because it does take time to prepare the chicken to such perfection.I will say though, their one miss is that their sausage is not good (salchipapa) its literally a very salty hotdog sliced up haha.",Great Peruvian restaurant. The chicken is the start and it is always juicy and flavorful. Make sure to pour or dip your chicken in the green sauce. It is delicious and has a nice kick! I always get the avocado salad and it's always fresh. Oh and how could I forget the sangria. They are strong and good! The service here is fast. This particular location only has a few tables to eat in. It's better to order your food to go. They also only accept cash here---unless you order online. Love Pio Pio. I've been to multiple locations and the food and service are consistent and you can't beat the price!,Pio Pio 1
242,"Worst delivery service ever. Ordered two dishes fried rice at 12:50 pm till now 14:30 not delivery yet. Called to restaurant , the guy says the order is already pick , just wait couple minutes more , I have been waiting couple 20mins from last call. Okay I have work on 15:00 . Paid money and eat nothing then enjoy the rest of my day :) New updated! Yeah we just got the order ! It's 15:00 o'clock now! My husband sent me the pic of order! Yeah ! The rice is stone cold ! Yeah and the delivery guy cannot find my apartment numbers ! Never try to order and delivery by this restaurant ! SUCKS! I almost call to Chase to disbill this transaction !","Couple days ago my friend and I stopped by to have some chicken.  First time being there to sunnyside location. As soon as we walked in to the restaurant the waiter  greeted us and got us the menu and water right away. What a nice start.. We ordered a lot because we both were hungry.We ordered mozzarella sticks, white snow cheese with fries, white snow cheese boneless chicken, Hot devil chicken, chicken sandwich with one bottle of corona and ice cream beer. I was craving for something spicy chicken so ordered hot devil chicken. The waiter asked me are you sure if I wanted it because it's spicy.No!! It wasn't that spicy so that got me a little disappointed so I took 1 star down.Also the sauce weren't fully covered on my chicken. Everything else were good! Especially the snow cheese on fries. I will definitely come by more often to try other stuff on their menu and next time ask for extra spicy if they can.",WTF? Are you kidding me? Why is this from the food?Why is the fiber coming out of the fry?,Best Korean fried chicken I've came across since coming to New York City. I've had the whole crispy chicken with half sweet & spicy (level 2) and half soy garlic. Beware - their level 2 sweet & spicy is HOT. WOULD DEFINITELY COME BACK FOR SOME CRISPY CHICKEN IN THE FUTURE,"Stopped here after a while. I'm surprised that they still have the same taste . I used to come here frequently back in the days.         As usual, I ordered crispy chicken wings with spicy sauce , fries, and avacado salad. Everything I had here was outstanding! Just loved it.         Overall, experience was great but just need a little more improvement on service.","I would have gave it five stars but my waiter wasn't very friendly. It was my first time here and I was trying to figure out the menu and how to order the chicken wings. And my waiter was very ""short and direct"" in his answers. Almost like he had an attitude.  Not sure of his name but he was the only one not wearing a hat.So I ordered the Crispy Fried Traditional Wings half with sauce (Sweet & Spicy - Level 2) and half without sauce.  These wings come hot out the fryer so be careful (I burned the roof of my mouth).  But they are the crispiest wings I've ever had in my whole life!  The the Level 2 was right on point.  I wouldn't dare try Level 3.  I am disappointed that the other flavors don't have a spicy option.  The Honey Garlic sounds really delicious but it's not spicy.  Next time I'll try it though.  I also had the truffle fries (not pictured).  They were good.  My first time having truffle fries so I have nothing to compare it to.  My husband really enjoyed his Spicy BBQ Chicken Sandwich.As for their drinks my husband was disappointed he couldn't partake in the unlimited beer.  All parties at the table have to partake in order to order it and I did not want beer soo...I had the Three Dons Mango Margarita which tasted good but barely any alcohol.  I would probably sneak in a flask next time.",Pelicana Chicken
243,"Just about everything on the menu is lu ro, braised meat. The noodle soup is authentic, but poor quality store bought noodles was disappointing. If you're going to be a noodle shop, at least make your own noodles.Nothing interesting at all, it's like 5 kids decided to open a restaurant and nobody knows how to cook anything special.That being said, the popcorn chicken was good. And the beef in the beef noodle soup was tender.","Newly opened spot on Bell and my mom picked to try Chimama tonight. I actually bumped into one of my Yelp peeps who was dining in with his family. Most of the tables were occupied until I saw a couple moved from a 4 seater (I hate benches so uncomfortable). My mom's heart was set on Niu Rou Mian (Soup) but unfortunately, it was sold out so she went with Zhu Pai Mian (Soup) instead...I told the cashier to separate the pork because I hate soggy meat. She also ordered Lu Rou Fan (too much rice and not enough braised pork belly), Lu Niu Rou (cold appetizer)...small portion not worth $8...my mom makes it way better just saying, and Zhu Pai...ugh it was the same pork loin from the noodle soup...usually the staff would point it out but not the case for me tonight because I would've ordered something totally different. Damn the pork loin was three very thin slices ugh. The broth of the noodle soup was superbly bland and the pickled vegetable wasn't crispy but soggy. It's a small space so make sure someone grabs a table before the other person goes to order the food. This noodle spot is self-service so you order the food at the back counter then they called out your number to pick up your own food. As of June 1st, they only accepted CASH!!! Overall it was quite a disappointment. I would rather travel to Flushing for a bowl of yummy goodness than here.","The cash only bit was a inconvenient at the moment but me and some guys still ended up ordering half the menu. The food wasn't mind blowing but by no means bad. If I lived in the area I would most likely stop by here and there.If you're looking for something easy, it's not a bad idea to swing by for a bite.","My God. You know you're in trouble when it's dinner time and you think about a restaurant and it happens every, single, day.I love this restaurant. Hands down. The feeling, the attitude, the food, satisfaction, everything. I can feel that they're trying to be supportive of the environment too. Awesome, a plus for that, but I already gave 5 stars. But be advised, it's CASH ONLY. And cafeteria style. That means:- Order at counter- Pay at counter (yes it means they don't force you for tip)- Sit yourself- Get your own utensils- Refill your own water- Dispose your plates, utensils, and food wasteBut they do bring out your food. Hahah the obvious. The cashier also come out to wipe the table as needed.But please, try this restaurant that obviously is already being loved by so many people (families). Be aware of busy dinner times!","Finally got to try out this restaurant after having it bookmarked for ages! I came here for dinner with my super awesome friend and we managed to snag a table right away at 7:30. It's self-serve, meaning you order at the counter, grab your own water/utensils, and bus your own table after you're done eating. They do bring the food to your table but the amount of tip that you leave (if any) is still up to your discretion. Service was very nice and the dining environment felt very homey. We ordered:Lu rou fan (R1)- Braised pork belly rice. Yum! The pork belly was delicious and the sauce mixed so well with the rice. Also comes with a delicious tea egg and pickled cucumbers.Gua bao (R2)- Pork belly buns. Again, the pork belly was delicious and literally melts in your mouth when you bite into it. The flavor of the peanut powder wasn't as pronounced as those I've had elsewhere though.Khong rou fan (R4)- Same as the Lu rou fan except the pork belly comes in thick slices instead of cut up pieces and there's also tofu as well.*Each rice dish came with a delicious radish soup on the side.I think Chimama's may have replaced Mama Lee's as my favorite Taiwanese restaurant in Bayside. While Chimama's menu items may be more limited, with classic Taiwanese dishes like 3 cup chicken, oyster pancake, etc. noticeably missing, the dishes that they do offer are prepared excellently. Not to mention that they have way more consistent hours and don't suddenly close and go on vacation for a couple of days. Prices are amazing. We spent a little over $20 for the both of us and we were both comfortably full after eating. If I lived in the area I would definitely be a regular! Looking forward to coming back and trying out their soup noodle dishes as well.","I'm a big fan of taiwanese food - the dishes are simple but the flavors are so rich. A great example is Lu Ruo Fan - it's just minced pork belly over rice with an egg. But boy is it euphoric.. and Chimama makes a pretty amazing bowl of it. Delicious flavorful, rich pork with just the right amount of fat and meat over perfectly cooked rice and a marinated egg. Oh and the pickled cucumbers add just the right amount of zest to the mix. I could eat this every day. And at their super low prices, I probably could! Of course I couldn't leave a taiwanese place without trying some popcorn chicken - no complaints there. Crispy and salty with the crispy basil leaves to go with it. And the service is excellente! The owners were so friendly and helpful when I went in to place my order. I'll be back, guaranteed.",Chimama's Noodle House
244,It was disappointing.. I saw good reviews on Yelp and gave them a try. It's not a place you should try.  The portion was very very small. It looked bigger in the pictures though. I know they have good prices but I would go to other cheap places that have similar prices and bigger portion. Sushi tasted just okay. Nothing special.  Service was also slow.. I won't come back..,I've been to this sushi spot a few times for lunch with co-workers and never left with anything more than just meh. The place is immaculate which I'll give them credit for but the food lacks flavor. The prices are on point compared to other casual sushi places.To date I've only had the bento boxes and a few of their sushi rolls. Portions are small and pack no punch. The sushi rolls pieces are also small. Think maybe the size of a quarter.I won't count them out though. If you need lunch in the LIC area and have a taste for ordinary sushi then go for it!,This is our go-to for sushi for delivery in LIC. The food is always fresh and the delivery is always fast. Which for some reason is difficult for other restaurants in the area.,"So I was just scrolling our yelp reviews and saw that I never updated Murasaki after all these years!So I want to tell you, after 13 years spent in LIC if we would have to choose the only three restaurants that need to survive on vernon Murasaki will still be number one!The sushi master and owner Tohey definitely grew with our special neighborhood and is as good as you can expect.We still always tell him that he is selling himself too short for his talents but he seems wanting to be the down to earth place that don't take themselves too seriously! (Or maybe he does not understand my french accent trying to give him business advices )Joke aside, for the quality, freshness and creativity he offers his star should shine much brighter in LIC! We advised him to introduce the LTD concept (Let Tohey Do) the pictures should prove you what he is capable of!Not mentioning that the staff is so lovely and attentive to all your needs, they love kids, they remember you every time you open the doors. It is definitely a neighborhood restaurant as it's highest!","Well today it is all about you should always try a restaurant twice before making your mind. I am a total sushi freak! so when Marusaki opened on Vernon I literally waited outside to be one of the first to try it. Our first experience was indeed quite distorted. My order was really good (it was Toro tartar and a couple of sushi to try if I remember well) but my wife had a horrible experience. So based on that we cancelled the place from our LIC restaurant list.However this WE, we had family visit from Rochester and she insisted to have some sushi for lunch.So Just because it is around the corner and we had little wonder with us, we gave them another shot.The place is still really Zen, nothing too complicated but tasteful and warm. The water fountain even helped to keep Maxime calm for 10 minutes, that only is already for us a reason to love the place.So this time we made a kind of shared lunch that really turned into a tasting event.The Toro tartar was even better than the first time, the Toro sushi a dream, I was even lucky enough to get Uni sashimi that just have been fresh delivered. We tried the mussels and a bunch of other things, and each one was better than the other.The menu is really worth exploring and I was really feeling embarrassed to have been so negative after our first visit. The sake and wine list is really accessible.Once we got the check another nice surprise, it is really extremely reasonably price and even the items listed MP, were not overpriced.So it is really back on our toplist and surely a must try in LIC.Was this review ...?","I came here on a weeknight and it wasn't very busy so we were seated as soon as we got in. We ordered the soft shell crab, broiled squid, salmon avocado roll, salmon skin roll, marble roll, and salmon sashimi (2 pieces per order). The fish was fresh and the rolls were pretty good. I expected the speciality roll (marble) to have been larger but for $10, it was a pretty decent roll. The salmon skin roll and salmon avocado roll were standard. The broiled squid appetizer came with this terayaki style sauce. The squid was slightly charred which I like but it was a little rubbery. It was probably over-cooked but I didn't mind it. The soft shell crab came with a garlic sauce but it overpowered the soft shell crab and made it soggy. It probably would have been better if the sauce came on the side. I probably wouldn't order this again. For dessert we got a scoop each of the green tea and red bean ice creams. The green tea was good and creamy but red bean wasn't good. It was icy and kept breaking apart in chunks so I think it had freezer burn. The next time I come back, I'm going to try their other desserts!The service was good - the waiters were very nice and kept refilling our waters and making sure we had everything we needed.I would recommend this place if you're looking for a no frills sushi restaurant. The basic rolls cost about 6-8 dollars and the specialty rolls ranged from 10-20 dollars.",Murasaki
245,"Nachos with chorizo, very good.Nice people. Server over counter let you try some if you are not familiar with Mexican food. There is small space with table and chair outside so you can eat with your dog.",Ordered take out from here for the first time. They told me to hold twice while on the phone over the course of five minutes. I already knew the 3 things I wanted and I could have ordered it in under 35 seconds. The food was definitely good even compared to Sunset Park / Park Slope tacos in Brooklyn but it was also expensive compared to Brooklyn tacos.  Decor: 8.5/10 Food: 8.5/10 Price: 6/10 Rating Customer Service: 9/10,"The food is great but if we talking about the service... IS THE WORST!!! They don't care about customers, the Venezuelan guy taking the delivery orders is very rude and he don't speak English very well... when he don't understand or how to answer, he just hangs up the phone. I live very close and my delivery took more than an hour to be ready, also when i call to ask he was very rude and he say he was very busy I was supposed to wait and stop bothering him. I really don't recommend this place... the food is not good enough to ignore the bad service.","Super authentic tacos (the soft flour ones doube-wrapped with cilantro, limes, onions & pico de gallo) served from a gyro-type skewer on a spit.Not fancy whatsoever. Definitely more of a takeout place. Didn't notice too many alcoholic beverages other than 2 or 3 types of beer. Chicken Quesadilla was thick, cheesy and hearty. Probably the best tasting item there.","I discovered this place when randomly googling Cinco De Mayo hotspots in NYC.  I stumbled across an article that stated the 5 places you should eat at to celebrate the day and this was the #1 place.  Not surprisingly, I actually didn't do anything on Cinco De Mayo and instead came here during the weekdays to grab some lunch to go.I went with the Veggie Burrito.  For one, I was pretty impressed with it.  First, the burrito itself was huge.  Second, there were literally a ton of veggies in the burrito.  Sometimes when people order ""veggie"" burritos, it's merely a burrito with rice, beans, lettuce, cheese... you know the standard items.  This was different - literally a variety of veggies throughout the burrito.  Even with the size of the burrito, it didn't fall apart pretty easily.  Huge plus. The burrito was $9.50, which given the serving size is a damn good deal.  There is a decent amount of seating inside (and outside if I'm right) so plenty of people sit in to eat too.  I'll be back.","I absolutely had to come back a second night cause the tacos were too good and the nachos caught my eye.The nachos are a statement bowl, really nice for sharing. Great combination of flavors but the tacos are still the best.",Taqueria Santa Fe
246,"The ravioli that never was. I ordered delivery and the food never came. When I called for an update, I was told the food was delivered to a grocery store and there was nothing they were willing to do.

Said it would be 30 plus minutes. Eh pass.,"I  tried the food in this restaurant and absolutely not impressed! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO NO ONE!!  The dishes blunt have no proper seasoning and"" luck of soul"" -  people serve in a bad dinners food like that !! I asked to change it but they are refuse it and told me that they are prefer to  refined  the money instead  .  That kind of "" restaurant "" doesn't care about the customers !!!","A small, hidden gem in Sunnyside; I love this place!Quaint and romantic - a perfect date spot. The food is made in-house and presented with care. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu and have not been disappointed once. Also, it's reasonably priced and BYOB - what more could one ask for?","First and foremost, take advantage of the BYOB policy here. There is not a charge to bring in your favorite bottle of wine or alcoholic beverage and enjoy it with the meal.Ill start with the negatives, I ordered the pork and lamb bolognese pasta and it was subpar. The peas had been overcooked and hard and the sauce was lacking in any distinct flavor. I was roundly disappointed mostly because it was the main dish.However, the prosciutto and burrata were pretty good. Very savory and wonderful with a touch of olive oil. The tiramisu was also fairly good here.Seems like some of the things on the menu here up to par and some are not. It might be worth another try in the future.","This is our go-to Italian in Queens.  It's a simple menu, small and cozy restaurant with wonderful service.  Even though the menu is small, the flavors are huge! Jimmy is attentive and always provides great service.",Zio Luigi
247,"Known as a Brazilian spot because of their meat station the food here is hit or miss. Usually it's very good but it does hit your wallet hard because they charge by the weight of your food. Today the food was a great. The place was very crowded and the hot food options were among my favorites: creamed corn, baked cauliflower and shrimp yucca to name some. The meat was also juicy yoday and very well flavored. Unlike steakhouses the meat here is flavored. Go to the man in the back and tell him the meat you want.  You even get to pick the piece hiy want after he slices it. I haven't tried their dessert before so no comment there.  A big negative about this place is they do not label their food so you never know what it is unless you ask them. It's annoying but boy to hats to guess what's in some of the items.Also check to see how much they are charging you before you pay. It's normal to get overcharged and the cashier often gets annoyed when you ask about prices.Mera's Tip: get your meat fresh off the grill","CHECK YOUR PRICES!!!They are not consistent and because we are not Spanish speakers we constantly get overcharged. Asked for clarification why I'm being charged $8.99 per pound she didn't clarify. Simply showed me my food then bagged it up without fully explaining. Never got salad bar or fish but charged for it. The food is really good it's a bummer I keep having inconsistent experiences. Old review: This place has great affordable prices with nice quality food. Went in today and really upset me was they charged me the extra $1 per pound for the ""salad bar"" I didn't get. She said it was for my vegetables that I got from the main buffet bar. My little 2 small pieces of broccoli upped my order $1 per pound so $2 total. More principle then anything. Not cool.","Sadly 3 Stars because this place has really good food.

She said it was for my vegetables that I got from the main buffet bar. My little 2 small pieces of broccoli upped my order $1 per pound so $2 total. More principle then anything. Not cool.","This is one of my family's go to places to eat. We even drive the extra distance because we like it so much.The food is self-serve, pay per pound kind of place. You basically go to the back and fill your plate(s) and then pay. There is a separate bbq meat section that is charged a dollar more per pound if you choose to get it. Overall, the food is so good. There are a few things that are always present like the rice, beans, cornbread (my favorite), and a few others, but everything else gets switched up, which gives you more options when you come back. In the salad bar, you can make your own or they cycle the menu for pre-made salads, such as with a base of quinoa, arugula, collard greens, or kale. The salad tastes very fresh and I personally like majority of them, but my favorite would have to be arugula, apples, cranberries, sweetened pumpkin with a light dressing.As for the desserts, I love the flan and strawberry shortcake. Flan speaks for itself, but with the shortcake, each layer of cake is very moist and filled with flavor, not even dry in the slightest. Each slice is $4. The atmosphere is very calm, relaxing, and clean. There is no waiter so you find your own seat and clean up after yourself. I've been here multiple times for lunch and dinner and have never had a seating problem.Overall, would highly recommend this place if you're looking for somewhere that has good food and is very casual.","This is a super cheap and enjoyable place to have all your favorite steak house meats in a chill and relaxed environment. There is both a hot and cold buffet which is honestly a hit or miss depending on the opinions they offer on that particular day. I knocked off a point because the buffet foods are never labeled which leads me to hunt down the staff (since it is a buffet and thus no servers around) and ask about what's in a majority of the dishes since I do have some dietary restrictions. But the price is always unbeatable, I stack my plate full of the meats and the buffet foods and some how never exceed 12$. Overall would definitely go back and do always recommend this place to my friends for some cheap churrascaria but hope they do start adding labels soon!","I moved upstate this past year and dream of their coconut caramel cake lol...to DIE for! One of the best Latin American spots I experienced in the almost 20 years I lived in Astoria - incredible variety of meats, vegetables, salads, and sides, plus they also have a meat carving station. Everything is really tasty and the buffet option is fun because you can pick & choose what (& how much) you want. It's a nice casual dining spot when you're really hungry and craving some delicious, homestyle Brazilian food. I hope to visit someday soon & highly recommend if you haven't checked out this little neighborhood gem on 34th Ave.",Villa Brazil Cafe Grill

So mad,"The food was good and the service was good up until the end when I received my bill. There is a SERVICE CHARGE for using a credit card. I understand there is a cost for using a credit card, but inform the public upfront. There are no signs anywhere stating the SERVICE CHARGE. It is a disadvantage to the public for not clearly disclosing what you would charge if any for using a credit card.","I met my friends and one of my friend recommend this Italian restaurant. Overally friendly local italian restaurant.We started with caesar salad, eggplant appet. Not too special but good. Also we got big pie and two kinds of pizza. Pizza was cispy and tasty good. truffle fungi pizza smell was good and pretty enough truffle smell. However, I disapoonted their Carbonara. It was little chunky and not perfect flavor. need little bit more soft and tender flavor.","I have been to this place twice and have always enjoyed it hereAwesome food, awesome service, awesome atmosphere, everything is just plain awesome.","I came in on a Saturday at 6 and it wasn't busy at all.

It's actually one of my favorites in the neighborhood.I've had: huevos rancheros, chorizoNote: this place is CASH only which caused for one unpleasant dining event (had to walk back to my apt to grab cash)","After 20+ years of living in Jackson heights, just recently discovered this little yet fabulous restaurant. Their food, service,ambiance are just wonderful!Favorites for breakfast:  blueberry pancakes, French toast and the Mexican breakfast You must try the fig salad (seasonal only) You sort of forget you are right on roosevelt Avenue,This is a ""MUST""","Worst chicken quesadilla I ever had in my life. I'm trying to maintain a diet and eat slightly cleaner and avoid street food specially fast foods and low class restaurants such as Taco Bell, McDonald's, Burger King, and White Castle but after I tasted the quesadilla from this place ""La Flor"", I said to myself that Taco Bell makes waaaay better quesadillas than this place . I've eaten many quesadillas from many Mexican restaurants and I know exactly what ingredients go on a quesadilla specially the sauces and this one didn't have any of them except the chicken. The chicken seemed like it was boiled. Normally the chicken supposed to be grilled and have flavor. Also, they used this thick ass tortilla/bread that was round instead of the flat flour tortilla that supposed to be folded in a half moon size and toasted but this was far from the real thing... horrible.","Great atmosphere. I was visiting from California, and the food was delicious. Everything is freshly made and the taste is consistently good every time. Their salsas are very tasty, and add a little bit of spice to your meal. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. They make you feel like family. They are the best restaurant in Queens.","the first time i tried this place was for sunday brunch (after a night of heavy drinking of i'm being honest) and it was AMAZING. the bf and i got steak and eggs, and spinach eggs benedict over jalepeno corn bread vs. english muffins. the highlight was honestly the eggs benedict because the combo of the sweet spicy corn bread with the creamy hollandaise and sauteed spinach was just perfect. i dont even think it was cause i was hung over. the eggs were perfectly poached and did the whole yolk porn thing too steak and eggs were alright- not memorable unfortunately the 2nd time we came, the eggs benedict were not as good. the eggs were overcooked and the cornbread was a bit dry so we were kind of disappointed because the first time set the bar pretty high. we paired this with blueberry pancakes this time because a couple next to us were sharing some and devouring it and they really were amazing! the blueberries are fresh, and the syrup was not too sweet. it all went well with the moist fluffy pancake to soak everything up.","What a cute breakfast spot we stumbled upon while taking a stroll down Queens Blvd. The atmosphere was super homey upon arriving and that feeling lasted throughout our experience here. The food was really tasty, I got the salmon benedict and the home fries it came with had zucchini in it, which was creative I thought. My boyfriend got the blueberry pancakes and eggs. His food was delicious as well. The coffee was underwhelming and the menu didn't have that many brunch options, which is why I gave this restaurant a 4, however, I'd definitely revisit.",La Flor
250,"I was let down, food was ok, I got the seafood risotto and one of the mussels wasn't opened and one of the clams had a broken shell and no clam.  We did go on a Saturday evening and it was crowded.  The place was crowded and LOUD.  The service took forever for anything. It hit me that the owner may want this to be a place you go to for an event or occasion I just would not make this my choice for an occasion because of how crowded and loud it was.","AVOID this place!! This was the WORST meal I have had in the 5 years I've lived in Astoria!!-first of all- i ordered delivery that came over an hour later than I was told. -I ordered 2 Greek salads- they were not equal in size- it was obvious that one salad was significantly larger than the other. -The saganaki cheese appetizer was DISGUSTING and came missing the ""jam"" it was supposed to have. Oh and it was ice cold-The scallops were terrible- $35 for 4 scallops is a sin... literally just a plate of scallops with a mix of sauce that looked inedible. They clearly don't care about presentation!!- to top it off I called and complained to the manager who told me he would credit my brother credit card as there was no way this meal was worth the $90 we were charged!! Tiniest portions and down right DISGUSTING food!! Manager tells me to call him the next day and he'll credit the card back, well I called 3 times and he NEVEr called me back till I had to call a FOURTH time!!! Then he argued with me and told me I was wrong and that the food was great.. ummm are you my taste buds?!? There are a million better places to eat in Astoria- especially for Greek!! Do yourself a favor and go to e taverna or Ovelia- hands down better service and taste at those restaurantsI would literally rather eat Burger King over this crappy food I hope the restaurant reads this and learns how to serve customers and maybe consider a new chef.. and manager too","Overpriced,  bad decoration, too many employees on the floor,  the girl (owner u owner daughter) should be a little more friendly for real..  it's a mediocre restaurant in Astoria not a big deal,  you're not even close to Taverna Kyclades!!!  Food is not good and Lunch Special In 32 dollars is just laughable!!!  You're not in meatpacking district","We got a recommendation to Amylos by a man I met earlier in the day at the us open. He has lived in Astoria for 10 years and told me the place was really good!!We were not disappointed!! Everything was great from start to finish. We were greeted by a lovely hostess who was friendly and told ysabout happy hour specials. We sat at the bar and proceeded to be amazed by Klevis, the mixologist/bartender. We tried several drinks and snacks and they were all amazing.Then we had dinner and that was great too. My cousin had the moussakka, which was creamy and delicious. We also had meats and lamb, which were all delicious.For dessert we had a delicious baklava/cream thing and dark chocolate tart. Amazing place!! Great ambiance!Klevis the bartender was a superstar","Amylos Taverna is the phoenix that has risen from the ashes of the beloved Uncle George's, an old-school Astoria Greek restaurant that sat where Amylos now sits.  It's a more modern, Americanized take on Greek cuisine.  All of the food was delicious.  They serve raw oysters and ""Greek tacos"" for example- something that a more traditional place wouldn't be doing.  The service was excellent.  Our server told us honestly what she thought of a few dishes and steered us toward better options.  The restaurant itself is pleasantly decorated with what looks like an olive tree by the front door and floor to ceiling window walls that open up to the sidewalk during warm weather.  The octopus, saganaki and kolokithokeftedes are all things I would recommend.  For a main, my mom really enjoyed her chicken.  My dad liked his fish (can't recall what kind it was), and I enjoyed my halibut- though I wish it was a bit more flavorful.  I definitely recommend this place for a more gourmet take on Greek food, but not if you want an old-school, classic Greek restaurant experience.","Celebrated a birthday dinner at this restaurant. The service and the food was amazing! The hostess was welcoming and our waiter was sweet and knowledgeable of the menu. For apps, We had the veggie chips, French fries and grilled calamari. For the main course, my group shared the Astakomakaronada (lobster pasta) and lavraki (whole fish, deboned).Totally recommend!",Amylos Taverna
251,"Being honest, wasnt a a big fan. I cameAfter brunch on a Saturday, was looking for a new place where i can work on my computer and eat/drink. Decided to walk from Kaufman to this location (not close), and walking in I was alittle confused of where to go or sit, or who to ask where to sit, kinda left wandering. I looked at the window seats(lots of people working there and alittle cramped) so then there were these glass tables aligned a banquet(was thinking perfect) but it was noticing that people Get alot coffee to Go, and then sit there to have it. So i thought no table service, so i sat at the bar. Honestly, either my bartender was really mad about something or just really irritated about something. It came off very strong and it got to a point that i was about to get mad myself. So i decided to leave. Imdecided to ask for change for a 20 so i can tip him in cash (usually a nice gesture) he gave me 2 tens, forcing me to tip him 20%, which i planned on to anyway, but he didnt give me a choice. So that really was a sign of character for me, jerk.Its a cute little place for coffee to go, food i had was ok (buscuits and gravy,salty though) almost to the point i had to stop cause i was having a heart salt rush. I would go somewhere else.","I've tried the Queen's room twice. First attempt I ordered biscuits and gravy, second attempt I ordered eggs benedict. I wanted to like this place. They have good coffee. They currently are very bad at doing brunch / breakfast. The biscuits and gravy are trash, I'm from the south and am offended by this limp imitation. The service was bad, wires crossed, long time to take our order when it wasn't busy, vaguely rude, messed up order (maybe this is why the English muffin was very burnt), wrong charge on bill. The eggs Benedict was so so so bad. I never complain at a restaurant or send things back but I came close here. To top it off it's very expensive.","Used to be my go to spot but I find now that they are too busy and trying too hard to be a restaurant. Miss when it had more of a cute coffee shop vibe. With that said, their food options are decent.",Came in here for drinks on Friday night.Manager was really nice.  Nice atmosphere.  Solid prices.  Recommend.,"Hung out here Saturday night with my friend, Jack. Solid, low key place. Halloumi Fries, Halloumi Fries, Halloumi Fries. Get them. Get two orders. Drinks were good too. Sat at the bar, bartender was super chill and it was not too busy for a Saturday night and we left around 11:30.Will be back!!","A good vibes spot with great, quality food, and a decent happy hour deal. $7 wines, don't mind if I do. I had the harvest salad with salmon. It was good. The salmon was excellent. Only thing is the menu said the salad was kale but they served a mesclun mix instead. Sigh. The ingredients are definitely quality and the service is good. Bartenders are super friendly, solid local Ditmars spot.",Queen's Room
252,"The food is still delicious as usual but the portions of have gotten so tiny it's not even worth ordering. I had the beef redang. It comes with a soup, rice, and some sides. The beef itself was literally 4 bites before there was none left on the plate. I am an Asian woman about 5'5"" with a normal body mass index and left very unsatisfied. YMMV. I'd prefer to spend more money to get a little more food!

We ordered the lontong sayur (curry soup with rice cakes  + beef rendang) and nasi goreng special (special fried rice) and chicken sate (chicken skewers in peanut sauce). all were incredibly delicious. Ask for a side of sambal for that extra kick and flavor.will definitely be coming back to try everything else on the menu. seems like they're a very popular spot for to-go orders as well.","came here for sunday lunch with a couple friends. we also came here because it wasn't cash only and the other place we were considering waseverything we got was good and well seasoned, but their menu is definitely curry heavy, so we all pretty much got some variation of a curry rice or curry noodle dish.being malaysian, i didn't mind, but i think my friends wanted some more variety their portions are decent and you could either only eat half or inhale the entire dish depending on your appetite i think we would come back if we were feeling good asian curry, and were in the area might not go out of our way to come here though.","Few doors down from dek sen is another southeast asian mom and pop shop serving indo-Malay, nasi- everything. We had the fried fish fillet with spicy sambal, coco rice, potato curry and egg dish and a rice noodle clear broth with meatballs tofu and wontons. The plated dish was pretty yummy but the soup was super basic with small but delectable wontons. Both dishes were small- exactly lunch size for a petite person. If you're big eaters, you might want to split 3 dishes between 2 people. Soup honestly tasted like it's out of a package. Also, there's a total of 5 or 6 four tops so it's a tiny spot. They have platters and daily specials ran by one hostess/server and cooks. I'd definitely come back but it's a no frills type spot where they run out of items if you don't make it in early. (For example, id ask how my soup compared to 2 other ones on the menu to which they were both out of, so how else was the poor woman supposed to reply but ""good""?!) and my dude's first choice was also out. Granted we came at about 2:45pm.",Sky Cafe
253,Worse food ever. Went in there to order Plov. The rice was hard. Meat was over cooked dark and bitter. It seems to me that they served me food that was 5 days old. My advice go to Cheburechnaya in Rego Park where your money can be well spend. Will never order from there again. Not very kosher of them!!!,If you go to this place make sure call and make a reservation a day before. The server was rude and said only by reservation. They should have put on their website or on google. We made a long trip to try the food and unfortunately we had to leave even though they had plenty of open tables.,"Terrible service, the quality of this restaurant dropped significantly. I ordered shashlik lady bring me it after 55 minutes very cold but supposed to be hot, than I ordered hot teat she bring me it after 25 minutes it's crazy they wasn't that much busy by that time 6 waiters was there. Conclusion almost 1 hour for cold food and 25 minutes for a hot tea. I will never come back here and they raise their price but quality and service went down","Amazing food, ambience and the serviceWe definitely be back to this cozy restaurant Highly recommend!!!","I truly wish I took a picture of the food but the smell was intoxicating! I came here on a Sunday during lunch time and it was packed but the restaurant was still able to accomodate my party of 5 without a reservation. The restaurant is ethically decorated and the waitresses were dressed in authentic Uzbekistan clothing. The food is absolutely delicious! We ordered lamb, sweetbread, and chicken kebabs, salad, lamb ribs, lamb chops, and samsa. The food cane out hot and bursting with flavor but I have to say my favorite item was definitely the lamb kebabs (I'm still salivating).  I will definitely be visiting here again.","My friends and I came here on a Sunday for lunch, after having planned to eat Uzbekistan food for awhile. We did not make a reservation, but came in around 12pm, and were seated immediately. The restaurant around this time was rather empty, with only a few other tables of people. However, it filled up quickly. Between the three of us, we ordered five dishes, which I would say is too much food, as the food here mostly comes in large servings. We got one of the large bread dishes that was in a circular shape - I would say skip this, as it tasted like plain bread. Another dish I would recommend skipping is the nakhot garmack. It had a funny menu description, being described as a dish of veal that had the life boiled out of it, and was accompanied with chickpeas and sliced bread. However, it was quite tasteless and bland, and the soggy bread just made it all the more worse.The Samarkand summer salad was not bad, but nothing amazing. The standouts of the food here were the lagman soup, kebabs, and the Uzbek pilaf. The lagman soup had a thin, but flavorsome broth, with herbs that reminded us of Vietnamese pho in both taste and fragrance. I would love to eat this again if it was more accessible. The kebabs, especially the beef, were succulent and juicy. The lamb kebab did not taste quite right though. The Uzbek pilaf was a 5 star dish - with generous servings of meat, buttery rice, and vegetables, it was hearty and filled us up well on a cold day. The decor here transported us to Central Asia. All of the waitresses had heavy accents and were dressed in traditional clothing. Some did not speak English well. The service had been good while the restaurant was empty, but it became increasingly difficult to flag someone down when the restaurant got busier.  Value was great considering that the prices were very low, with large portions. Would recommend as worth the trip.",Taste of Samarkand
254,"Jamaican Flavors is a walk-up beef patty store front. There's two walk-up windows and two lines formed to place orders for food. Mind you there's no rice & peas here just delicious patties. There's a sign that says, ""Patties are made fresh daily"", but I'm not sure how true that is with such a small store front. They have a small assortment of patties to chose from. They have beef, hot beef, chicken, jerk chicken, curry chicken, bbq chicken, vegetable, calaloo & saltfish, jerk chicken sandwich, coco bread, and cheese. If you're interested in purchasing a large quantity they offer 12 dozen beef or chicken patties for $24.99. There's no way you can walk pass the stand and not be tempted to order a patty. The smell is so inviting. I've tried the beef, hot beef, and curry chicken patties. The beef and hot beef tastes amazing with cheese and coco bread. They also have refreshments such as Jamaican sodas, Snapple, and water.",Good beef patties. Better than Golden Krust. Buy from the window. Lines can be long but they move quickly. They also sell Caribbean baked goods.,"If you going to the coliseum, this a must go. If you're riding through the area, this a must go. Haven't had anything from here where I was disappointed.","This place may be a small spot but they say big things come in small packages.

The taste is like it comes from the west indies straight from Jamaica on the island.you can't forget about there jamaican  pineapple soda that drink is one of my favorite jamaican sodas all timeAnd there spicy cheese beef patties with the soft coco bread, they are the top of the chain. I know I have been to dozens of beef patties spots. And none of them compare I dont want to name names but they know who they are.plus if you like jerk chicken breast sandwiches they make some really good jerk chicken sandwiches. It is seasoned just right and it is a decent size. It won't  disappoint. so when in Jamaica queens on jamaica ave chilling out shopping on 164 st stop by this place especially if you love jamaican food or west Indian food.","Hands down the best beef patties with cheese and coco bread in town.there patties have a nice jamaican style taste, and there jamaican pineapple sodas are the best .they are cold straight out of the the ice cooler .they always have business. There is always a line there at there spot.","Trying to catch up with old reviews & I'm trying to figure out how I forgot about this spot. The Beef patties can't get much better than this! The Beef Jamaican Pattie had me shook with plenty of flavor. It is so tasty combined with the fresh coco bread. The line moves really quickly so don't get scared by the long lines. Go ahead and join in. Their patties are not greasy, on the contrary, they are spicy and full of flavor. It's 100% worth it to come here and eat some good food.

255,"To start with, a cute little place seen from the 65 place rd. We made a U turn and thought to give it a try. It was 9:00 am Saturday morning so we were up for breakfast and coffee. I understand things go wrong and sometimes things don't work out but everything goes wrong and missing is just awful especially when you open a business. We looked at the menu which was short and precise. Coffee first!! There was one girl working. I mean she was the cook, the waitress and took care of counter/billing. Okay, she brought coffee. Nice glasses, I liked it. We ordered homemade omelet with toast and greens/home fries and Belgian waffle topped with blueberry and strawberry. She came after 5 minutes saying no strawberry, I said okay substitute with banana, she came after 10 minutes saying no banana. I said okay what do you have ? She said only syrup no whipped cream. We waited 35 minutes for food and seriously?? Anything I asked was not available. When she brought home made omelette it looked worse than I make home. No mushrooms, spinach or cherry tomatoes? Only onion. We were totally not ready for a Saturday morning breakfast like this after waiting 45 minutes there just with a cup of coffee.We asked for bill and left. My first experience was awful. Never recommending or returning.Sorry, but at least let the customer know simply and honestly- ""we are not ready for breakfast yet, helper worker is not here. You can order anything from the ready made items like cake, carrot bread and that's it"". Please don't waste someone's time coming after every 10 minutes telling them banana finished, no strawberry, no bagel, no blueberry. I mean nothing??? Please pre prep for next day to open the business on weekends. Customers are not ready to hear stories.Management- please look into this firmly.","Well, I gave this place a few chances on Grubhub. The first time I was super happy, the egg sandwich and empanada were both delicious. The second order was a bacon egg and cheese on a croissant but I received ham instead of bacon. The third order was canceled by the restaurant. I just ordered another bacon egg and cheese, this time on a bagel. It arrived on a burnt croissant. I doubt the croissant was fresh. The empanada is advertised as beef, cheese, and beans but only has beef in it. I'm not sure if that's a wording error on the menu or if it's just wrong. But the shell was thick and chewy and there was not enough filling. I see that this place haslotsof good reviews so I'm not sure what's going on.",We came here based on the good reviews via yelp but the sandwiches were not a big deal. The waitress didn't speak much English and got our orders wrong. She only put in for one sandwich so we had to wait another 10 mins for the other. And we asked for white bread on one but she gave us both whole wheat. Sigh.,"Love this place, food is yummy, with quaint outdoor seating. Food is very authentic and they cooks will make adjustments upon request.",Sooo delicious! I had a Nutella cappuccino which was divine. I also had the Jacup's brunch with beef and an arepa with their spicy Chile sauce. It was an array of amazing flavors. The service was great! It's a small shop but it does have some outdoor seating. Loved it!,"Cute little place with 3 low top tables and 2 high tops. Some unique features were cute with the menu on brown paper and nice cups and glasses for drinks.My son was disappointed there were no waffles which were listed on the menu. I had the egg, cheese, bacon on a bagel. The only bagel to ""choose"" from was sesame. My sister had the omelette which was disappointing. The toast was cold with VERY little (if any) butter. She asked for more butter to be put on and still didn't notice much added. Then the waitress gave her a container of butter to spread herself. The omelette was fair with vegetables of onions, peppers and tomatoes.",Jacup's
256,"Delicious and authentic Sichuan food that is very easy to miss. Alley 41 isn't located on one of the most populous roads in Flushing and I would have never found it if not for my friend who invited me out to dinner.On top of the mouth watering food, the restaurant itself is also very spacious and clean with great staff. The yakult soda they offer is simple but also very refreshing during a spiced up meal. My group ordered many dishes consisting of pork belly, in house smoked stir fried pork belly, cold chicken in chili oil, lamb chops (SPICY!! goodness), Dan Dan noodles (must get), two other types of noodles that I do not know the name to, tofu soup, and their famous fish pickled soup (also a must). Everything hit the spot and I've no complaints. The level of spice isn't overwhelming so it does not overpower any of the Szechuan flavors. Will def come again!","Food was good. The were alcoholic drinks on the menu but when I ordered a beer they said they didn't have any because no liquor license. My Mapo tofu dish came with a serving spoon and I was by myself. After the couple seated at the table next to me were finished and left, the staff cleaned the table with windex (at least that's what the bottle said). I have never been a fan of certain cleaning products because of my asthma... thankfully I had finished eating also. This was my first experience eating in the restaurant but I've ordered online before and that  didn't go well since on my end the order when through but when my husband arrived to pick up the order they hadn't received it (connection was down). My husband reordered my food and paid cash.","I've ordered from here through uber eats 3 separate times for pickup. For those who know how uber eats pick up works, the restaurant tells you when it's ready and you're able to track it. So I get there, it says my order is ready for pick up. Guess what. I had to wait 15 minutes for them to make my order. The second time, I get there. I ordered pork with green peppers. What did I get? Beef with green peppers. That option isn't even available on their UberEATS lunch menu. I wasn't about to make a big deal and waste food so I just took the beef. The third incident is why I'm writing this review. I scheduled orders for pick up today at 4 PM. I get the texts that my orders are ready. My brother went to go pick it up. It's 4:21 PM right now and he's still waiting. Apparently out of my 5 orders, only 4 are showing up even though all 5 are marked as ""ready for pickup"" on UberEATS. Additionally, the restaurant gave away my orders to someone else ??? So my brother is currently waiting. The food here is alright but I wouldn't recommend ordering for pickup.","TLDR: Szechuan newcomer to Flushing. A lot of unique flavors and dishes not seen at other restaurants. Try the Cumin Lamb, Cold Noodles with Pork Belly and the Dan Dan Noodles.Alley 41 is one of the newer restaurants in Flushing, they're tucked away on 41st Road which is that side street behind of Kissena.It's in the middle of the street and parking around here is difficult. However, the parking lot across the street does do validation with the restaurant. I think the minimum spend is $50 but I don't remember exactly.The restaurant reminds me of Hong Kong a bit. We rotate between Szechuan restaurants but Alley 41 is definitely at the top of our list.The noteworthy dishes for us are the Cold Noodles with Pork Belly. Mix it all up with the sauce, the cucumbers and the pork for an awesome appetizer bite!I've tried a whole bunch if dishes here but the Cumin Lamb is what stands out. Imagine lamb chops, covered in fried garlic, chili, cumin (obviously) that explode in each bite. They serve atop french fries which is a bit odd - but it totally works for this.If you're into duck, the Tea-Smoked Duck is quite good. The Dan Dan Noodles have a real spice to it which I really enjoy.","We passed by and were intrigued.Really nice selection of food. We received tea to the table as we set and pickled cabbage. Was really nice, not overwhelmingly pickled. Tea was also nice, probably Jasmin, we thought, but not sure (why didn't we ask?!) We had two main dishes and one ""specialty dish"".The layered pancake was, to me, a crustier version of the fried dough with scallion I love in Asian cuisine. It was crunchy, flaky, as this kind of going should. Very tasty and light.Our main dishes were the Flounder in garlic sauce and the braised pork in hot oil and veggies.  Wow! Those were amazing! The fish was served over bok choi, was very soft and flavorful. The braised pork... woohoo!! I didn't think I am ""chili-challenged"", but this one was really spicy. Still, very flavorful, fresh and the meat melted in our mouths. The portions also very large.the only reason o gave 4 stars (I would actually give 4.5 but no  1/2 here), is that they wer not so well versed in timing of the food. One main dish came out first, than the other and finally the Scallion Pancake. It was weird. But overall service was nice, attentive. We will be back.","been on a Szechuan food kick lately and finally tried on Alley 41.  came here with my brother on a Saturday afternoon and the place was quite empty.  the decor was nice, definitely a step up from average restaurants in flushing.  we were quickly seated and handed ipads containing the menu.  we got the following to try:-eggplants in spicy sauce: steamed eggplants with a charred peppers and chili sauce.  kinda hard to describe the taste but i did like it.-pork belly in garlic sauce and cold noodles:  two Szechuan food classics combined into one dish!  the pork belly was tender and not too fatty, garlic sauce was robust but slightly too sweet for my taste.  mixed everything up with the cold noodles and they were tasty.-twice cooked pork with chinese chives: sooooo good!  perfectly seasoned and i loved eating it with rice.service was good (surprising to find in flushing lol). few days after, i came back to get takeout (dan dan noodles and the eggplants).  the noodles were cooked ok, but the meat sauce was too salty.  i had to hold back on the sauce.  overall, a good spot for Szechuan food, will be back for sure.  :-)",Alley 41
257,"Ate lunch here yesterday. My roommate used to live in the area and raved about this place. I'll start by saying the food was deliciousss. They have a buffet of a variety of different things from standard Brazilian fare to a random beff stroganoff. I got myself some rice and beans, veggies, a little bit of this salmon and broccoli mixture and then I made my way over to the meats. They have an attendant manning the grill that will cut up a variety of different meats for you, I counted at least 5 yesterday. I got myself the sirloin steak. While it was tasty, it was a little fatty and I had to cut around some of meat. Either way, definitely coming back here.","This was once a ground breaking concept in Astoria, when they first opened it was original Brazilian cuisine, done with care for details. I returned to Copacabana after being away from Astoria for the last 3 years. The buffet food was absolutely disgusting, I wish I had a better way to describe it, but I can't. Food was dry and flavorless, I asked one of the guys behind the counter if the Brazilian chef was the same guy and he said there were no more Brazilians working in their kitchen. Service was slow, cashier was unfriendly, it seemed like our presence there was a source of annoyance for her (we were a group of 4), I was sort of embarrassed I recommend this place to my friends. I will never go back to Copacabana!!","Hummm..,about 5 friends and myself went here on a Sunday afternoon.Food:        So you'll PAY by the POUND which DOESN'T really make sense.  I had Black Beans, White Rice..,a small Chicken Breast, and some Lasagna. These items add weight to you're medium size * styrofoam * plate. When you pay at the cash register before entering the seating area I paid like $19.00 plus my small can of Diet Coke. The only way to pay less is to get light weight foods..,like salad, rice, broccoli, or a small cube size piece of beef.      Then you sit on metal ( no arm-rest ) chairs  that are to close to each other..,and if you're sharing a table with just 3 other people, it suffocating. Ambiance:  Reminds me of my grammar schools lunchroom.Waiter/ Waitress           None..,as mentioned, you serve yourself.,pay a non-energetic cashier, who doesn't even make eye contact. Conclusion: I wouldn't return.....","Omg I love this place. Used to live right in the area and stumbled across this place. Can't say it's a hidden gem because it's quite large but don't be fooled by the unassuming exterior - this is some of the best Brazilian bbq in Astoria and beyond. When you walk in there's a salad bar and a hot bar with rotating pre-made entrees (salmon, shredded beef, turkey, oxtail, etc) and sides (mashed potatoes, rice & beans, steamed veggies). I like the salsa looking salad with tomato, onion and peppers. Adds some acidity to the meal. The sections always great and I haven't had anything that's been bad. However the best part is definitely the butcher section with all the meats rotating on skewers. You go up and they'll cut your protein at your desired quantity. There's usually chicken heart, sausage, chicken thighs and all kinds of pork loins and steaks. I think I had the sirloin (he asked me how I wanted my meat cooked, I told him medium and he recommended one) which was delicious. The meats are always seasoned well with plenty of salt. Always cooked well and never chewy. Don't expect anything fancy, pretty bare bone place where you get your food, weigh it at the counter and find a table to sit. My boyfriend and I got two full plates and a soda for $22, can't beat that! Come check this place out ASAP if you haven't already!","A new concept of the Brazilian Steakhouse Restaurant, that I have not seen before, where you weight what you eat, I will recommend to skip the buffet and go to the end where the good meats are,  even though the wings and the fishballs are super delicious. I came here with a friend and we ate a lot of meat. The price is reasonable for the pounds, they have two options of price only meat or meat with side, anyone you select is a good choice. In the buffet, you can find rice, salad, wings, chicken, skirt steak, fishballs and more. In the good meat section you a lot of different steak cuts from the premiums one to the one that is not than fancy.  The quality and taste of the different types of cuts are very juicy, with a tender taste and super delicious.","Very reasonably priced and tasty. I regret not taking pictures, because the steak was picturesque.Ask for the grillmaster's recommendation. I went at an odd late-afternoon hour and some of the meats were dry or over-well, especially the less popular cuts. The grillmaster is happy to tell you this and recommend what the best cuts are at the time of your visit.",Copacabana

It is on the pricey side, but it is well worth the food and service.It's not pretentious despite the prices and ambiance (if you read some of my past posts, this is a big factor; just fucking feed the customers and stop making it look like a glossy magazine picture; make the food to taste great).Somehow, Christo's makes food that not only tastes delicious, but looks extremely appealing.Just go there and you'll see what I'm talking about.","This is hands down my favorite steakhouse. The food is prepared exactly how you ask, and the service is unbeatable as well.

The steak sauces are nasty. The steak was slightly over cooked. The mac and cheese wasn't that great either. I dont believe that we would give this place another try.,"My first time here did not disappoint.  Context: birthday celebration.  Upon entering, bar to the immediate left.  We order Chardonnay while we waited for the rest of the party to show.  Pro tip, make a reservation.  It was a Tuesday evening for us, not that it matters ;)We were seated immediately at a great table in the dining area to the right of the bar.  They commenced to take care of us like family for the rest of the celebratory evening.  We ordered cocktails and Chardonnay by the bottle.  Started with their oysters which delivered.  However, the veal meatballs app was a disappointment.  Dry and not enough sauce, hands down.  We ordered the porterhouse for two to feed three people.  We.  Had.  Left-overs.  Sides to be ordered separately.  We decided on their classic mash potatoes and string beans (warning: they do not trim the stems.)  No bueno in my opinion. Service was attentive and fluid. There wasn't a substantial wait for any of our dishes. Ambiance is contemporary and straightforward. Classic wood fixtures, along with booth seating.  If I'm the vicinity, craving a decent steakhouse, I will return.","Weekday birthday dinner ambience old school needs a little love renovation attentive friendly serviceI went here because I wanted steak and the Greek options unfortunately new management so not much greek to inspire appetizer trio uninspired crab cake too much bread , lamb wrap greasy grilled oyster tiny too much tomatoes seafood not Greek fresh nicely cooked well seasoned tender steaka tad more salt possible a little too much fat /gristle rib eye and filet both sides were stars mac and cheese decadent , truffles fries and hazelnut green beans sauces with steak not great dessert creme brûlée and molten cake Wine selection all over the place up to $8000 bottle / they need to up decor food service for anyone to be spending $8000 for a bottle they did have some nice reds for reasonable pricing Overall nice neighborhood steak place if you are in Astoria For Queens steakhouse though Uncle Jack's has them beat","I was so excited to try this place! My partner and I decided to take his father for his birthday. I will mention, parking is very difficult in this area. However, I felt this place was so worth it. Upon entering we were seated right away. Staff and owner was welcoming and approached our table several times to check in on us. They bring out bread with this delicious olive spread. For appetizers, we ordered baked clams and saganaki (fried cheese).  Upon checking in on Yelp, they gave me a complimentary house wine. I chose the Chardonnay which was great. My partner and his father both had beers. They had a decent beer selection. For entree, I chose the hangar steak and my partner and his father had the surf and turf. Surf and turf consists of: filet mignon, lobster, two salads, and two sides. They chose saute mushrooms and bacon mash. For my dish, it does not come with a side. I chose garlic mash which was amazing!  We had no room for dessert but they had a nice variety of options. Overall it was a great experience.

260,"Two stars. Just because i love pizza. 1.  The place is tiny. So not much room for making a line. Not a huge problem when waiting for pizza. 2. As I was standing outside waiting on the line, I hear an employee, arguing with a customer. Employee tells customer, "" go to your fucking car before your girlfriend beats your ass. I get off at 10pm "" then proceeded to ask ANOTHER CUSTOMER questions about that other guy. ( he saw them shake hands ) SUCH A HORROR. 3. That same employee was so caught up on that customer that I was charged incorrectly. Plain $3 (2)Pepperoni $3.50 (1) Pesto $4 (1)ONE Soda $2 ( assuming ) but I was charged $18. Didn't realize until I got home. The pizza itself----- not my favorite. The sauce was very sweet. My fellow yelpers raved about it. The crust, although very thin, was very soft. Not crispy at all. Very large slices though. One star for the size of the slice.","Was walking to nearby Forest Park and decided to revisit this classic slice joint. The sauce is still very sweet, I don't mind this. But the crust is still a floppy mess :/ It would be a really good slice if it wasn't liquid, greasy goop. Space is small, with a massive beer selection. Did not expect to see Abita Purple Haze! When you walk in, there's a small counter with stools to sit at, and no AC. Through two swinging doors, you'll find a sit down area where you can order larger plates with a waitress, and this does have AC. It's a cute space.","Overly sweet sauce, not much of it, and limp, floppy crust. Wasn't a fan of the pesto slice either, again not much sauce but it was covered with a ton of cheese.","The Pesto slice was the best slice of pizza I have ever had. After hearing many good things about this pizzeria, I went late night with a buddy. I'm a huge fan of pizza, and have eaten at many places, so I was blown away with how great the pesto slice was. There was a long line (11pm) on a weekend, it went a few storefronts down. Totally worth it. I had 1 pesto slice (5/5) and I tried their regular (3/5). The sauce in the regular slice was too sweet for my liking. 100% recommend the Pesto Slice!","Went to Dani's House of Pizza to get some pizza. Initially, we sat in the restaurant. The restaurant menu has no pizza on it. Apparently, you can only get pizza at the counter, not if you get a table, which is dumb.We went to the counter and ordered a few slices. I got a pesto and plain slice. Both were pretty good. The tomato sauce on the plain slice is noticeably sweet as others have noted. The crust on both slices was thin and crisp, strong enough to support the weight of the toppings. The cheese was pretty standard. The line was out the door, a fight almost started among some patrons. It's pretty good pizza, especially if you like a sweeter sauce.",Pizza smelled awesome at the entry . The pesto and cheese pizza kids enjoyed it .

261,One of the go to restaurants in the neighborhood. Whatever you order is going to be good.Gotta have the house salad as an appetizer.,"Skip this place. I took my parents here for a birthday dinner. We were seated quickly at the front of the restaurant. Unfortunately, that's where everyone stands when they're waiting to be seated. There was at least one *very* large family hovering near our table for the duration of our entire dinner. Not their fault, but the restaurant staff should have noticed this and asked them to stand outside. It was really unpleasant to have to yell over our food. We ordered the parillada (mixed grill) and the seafood stew. The meat was kind of tough and unevenly cooked. The seafood stew had some large shrimp that impressed my parents, but was otherwise really unexciting. Overall, it was very meh.",DONT GO ! MINUS EVERY STAR IN THE WORLD !!This place is just terrible Service is very rude Food quality is very cheap cuts and they chargea tonPotato salad is raw and taste like nothingSteak is like a microwave diner  I seen so many great reviews they have to be fake  Reviews because anyone that says they like this place is lying !If the owner wants to be helpful he can close down and save everyone from eating here ALL IN ALL - Anywhere else is a better place to eat then this TRAP,"My family and I have been coming to this restaurant since they opened at this location. They were previously located in Roosevelt Ave. We come here about once a month. The food is delicious and the staff are very attentive, friendly and welcoming. We usually get the house salad with avocado, skirt steak, fried cheese and sangria. This restaurant never fails to satisfy us. In my opinion, I rather spent my money here than a $$$$ steakhouse all day, everyday.","Yay Yelp You've done it again!  Cannot believe my husband has never been to this spot- this is so close to his old hood.  We've been to other Argentinian spots in Elmhurst and surprisingly had a legit better spot in SD better than Elmhurst!  So we were staying nearby and my husb was searching for some sweetbreads and chimichurri and Yelp followed through!  Thanks Yelpies!Anyways, back to the goods, got the meet platter and although it says no substitutes I still asked for less chorizo and other meats and the waiter was easy going and said sure no problem! Yay, skirt steak, ribs, sweetbreads galore.  Got the meal for 2 but it was more like a meal for 4!  Can't wait to go back.  Oh and the Best Part was the Chimichurri perfecto!  Acid, herbs, garlic great balance, made us so happy for a last night but def. won't be our last time!  Muchas Gracias!","This is a hidden gem in Jackson Heights. If you don't know, now you knowwwww If you're looking for great Argentinan steak, then this is the place for you. Even if you're not in the mood for steak, their pastas, pizza, chicken, and other dishes are absolutely delicious. Ask for this house salad, and you're going to want to take their dressing home. Don't ask, because it's a secret. Of course, be sure to order a pitcher of Sangria. I prefer their white sangria, but their both great. I go very frequently with my family, and have even done special occasions here. If you come enough times, the staff knows you. We walk in and they know us all. They really get to know you. Amazing service, great food, and always a good time here.",La Cabana Argentinan Steakhouse
262,"I saw this delectable looking charred fish on instagram(Eric ripert maybe) and for weeks I was staring at the photo. No one wanted to travel to queens with me so one night I just got up and came here. Best decision of the damn day. When I say the food is deliciousAnd fresh.This is some smack ya momma food. I HATE EGGPLANTBut Eggplant from Abuqir is out of this damn world.Get it fried, get it grilled, get it blackened, just come and get it.","their blackened fish branzino/striped bass is very salty with old bay seasoning.  it's so salty it burns your tongue. If you peel off the skin there is not as much to eat bc the meat is stuck on the skin.   I also ordered calamari and shrimp grilled.  Basically, they sprinkle Old Bay seasoning on everything.  A little sprinkle here, a little sprinkle there, everything is starting to taste the same.  It kind of tastes like Louisiana southern style.  Also, they don't have many vegetable choices,  just salad really.  It was good the 1st time,  2nd time not really, 3rd time not again.  Not very comfortable to sit there.","Incredible meal from start to finish. Unaccustomed to ordering from a ice bed of seafood, the Abuqir team helped us craft a meal of frequent favorites. Branzino came out fresh and flavorful, and the Tajin (we opted for shrimp and calamari) was genuinely astonishing. Bill came out lower than we expected given the amount of food, the freshness of the food, and the uniqueness of the fare. Will absolutely be back.","Overall Value:  Oh my.  This place is off the charts.  Some of the best and freshest seafood I have ever had (and I am Greek, we know our seafood), cooked to perfection, and extremely modest prices.  I am coming back and bringing the whole family!The Food:  Oh yes.  A massive feast for two that ended up being $60.  There is a fish-monger style set up where all the fresh fish and seafood is displayed on ice, and you pick what you want.  You can get anything cooked one of five ways (blackened, grilled, fried, tajine, and one other I am blanking on).  We just asked for the owner's recommendations, and he guided us through it.  There is no menu or posted prices because everything is just market price, but it was all very reasonable.  We got a large grilled seafood plate with calamari and black tiger shrimp ($12 for 6 very large shrimp and $11.21 for the calamari), and two large scallops ($7.20).  These were all incredible.  The scallops were like butter.  The pieces of calamari and each of the shrimp were huge, and the flavor packed a punch without overpowering the natural sweetness of the seafood.  Cannot recommend enough.Branzino ($16.04 for the whole fish):  We got this blackened at the recommendation of the owner.  Wow.  Such amazing flavor - a mix of charcoal-like smoke, garlic, and salt combines in a super flavorful bite.  The fish was also incredibly moist, with a really crispy skin.  This is exactly what I was looking for when I went to Seattle and got blackened fish, but that failed to deliver this type of flavor.  Small Mussaka ($4.00): Really nice plate of eggplant with tomato and peppers.  Tastes just like what my dad would make - home-cooked goodness.Small Brown Rice ($4.00): Perfect complement to the fish, and actually really flavorful on its own.  Has a really nice chew and texture to it as well.Pitas (included): These are awesome.  I've never had a pita like this before - The top was crispy like a cracker and the bottom chewier than a greek pita, but in a great way.  Space and Pace:  This is not a large restaurant, and we were surprised to see it stay busy the entire time we were there, which was on off hours (2:30 - 4pm).  It seems like a neighborhood spot where a lot of families come to eat, which is a great sign of quality/price.  It's a low key spot, limited frills spot with top notch food.Service:  Excellent.  The owner helped guide us through selecting our seafood and how it would be cooked, and then the server helped us select our sides.  Really friendly and welcoming, it feels a lot like a home-cooked meal from my yaya.","Seafood...Mediterranean...in the same sentence YES! Let's start off with their side salad nicely, freshly tossed with drizzle of oil and sprinkles of cumin, YUM. Babaganoush dip is incredible (and I don't even like eggplants).And the real deal are those lifeless seafood sittinflg on ice screaming eat me!!!The shrimps deep fried are seasoned just right with a thin layer of batter that crunch with every bite. The scallops are so fresh you can probably eat it raw, but we opt for the grilling drizzle with olive oil and it just melts in your mouth. Last ...dun  dun  dun...but definitely not least the Egyptian blacken Branzino perfectly smoked.","TLDR: Fresh Hummus, Fresh Fish, dont get turned off my its appearance.I would define this place as a hole in the wall because it doesn't look like a A class restaurant but it is definitely A class food like every other gear hole in the wall restaurant.I came here for a friend's birthday dinner and ordered a salad, hummus with pita, babaganoush, calamari, a grilled fish, a fried fish, the stew. Everything was very fresh and would recommend every one of these dishes.It is hard to find parking in the area so I don't recommend driving. When I was looking for a parking spot and passed by the place it looked like a take out restaurant. After I parked and looked inside it looked very family oriented like the customers always come back and the owner knows his repeat customers. The owner is very friendly and cares about your experience and his restaurant.",Abuqir Seafood
263,"I came here for American style food in Queens crossing food court, because I was bored of Chinese food in Flushing.I ordered grilled salmon, salad, Brussels spout and yam. The salmon was moist and was topped with green and orange sauce. Roasted Brussels spout and yam was also delicious. Price was $11.00 with no add-on. Eating healthy is not cheap.Highly recommended.","When I first came here a few months back, I had the best salmon in my life, so yesterday while in Flushing I thought I'd get me some more. Along with the salmon, we went with their brown rice, beets, sweet potato and leafy salad. Whilst eating it, it was obvious the salmon wasn't the same heavenly, succulent, perfectly-seasoned experience I had previously. The salmon was drier and wasn't as pliable as I remember it being, I guessed it had been sitting there a while but this didn't bother me too much. Everything else was sub-par, definitely NOT worth the exorbitant prices! What DID bother me, warranting only a one star review was the hell I endured after a few hours of eating the salmon. The worst vomiting episodes I've ever had in my life, far worse than my bad morning sickness during pregnancy, I couldn't even keep water down! And with a pretty $12 price tag?! Are you freaking kidding me?! I can say without a doubt it was the salmon because I had nothing to eat yesterday previous to this chaos. It's common knowledge meats, especially seafood, are a breeding ground for bacteria when not properly prepared/cooked/stored with the proper food-handling etiquette. I could see that the salmon was cooked through so I can only saw they didn't keep the salmon warm at an acceptable temperature.Whilst from first glance the stall looks immaculate, obviously food safety standards are lacking. I wouldn't wish this hell on anyone else so I highly suggest skipping this place and eating at one of the other many neighbouring stalls.",Didn't wow me.  Portion's small. Didn't make me feel full.  Salmon's way too salty.  The grilled vegetables and cucumber salad were ok. For 2 sets of meal plus 2 canned drinks cost us $29.00.  On the pricey side.,This place is a hidden gem located in the food court of Queens Crossing. They have a small selection of proteins and sides and best of all the foods always consistent. It's my go-to spot when ever I'm on the go or working in the area. My favorite is the Salmon on brown rice with a side of potatoes. I hope they roll out with more drink options in the future!TLTR; Healthiest food alternative in Flushing.,"Me: Mom what did you think of that guy who was walking by us?Mom: Which guy?Me: The one with the red backpack and Nike shoesMom: Ok LahUpon finding this place via Yelp and further looking it up on Instagram, did I decide to travel all the way from Manhattan to Flushing. I can agree with Yelpers that the salmon portion size is a bit small considering what we're paying, and that this is like the Asian version of Dig Inn. I sent my friend all the way in California a photo of my food, and he said, ""Though they could've given a little more salmon It looks really good though!Depending what you order and the sides you choose, for the most part everything is healthy, but some veggies had some excessive oil. The guy working the counter and register was really nice, answering my questions and even gave me a small sample of the cucumbers since I questioned if they were spicy or not. Also, the sauce for the salmon is to die for!Ok Lah is better than OK.","I love that this spot exists in Flushing! There really isn't anything else like it in the area. As others have said, it's comparable to an Asian-American Dig Inn since it's healthy, delicious, and affordable. But at the same time, it definitely has its own flavor and voice. I really enjoy the distinct sauces and seasonings that they incorporate. My impression is that the owners have something to say with this food and aren't phoning it in. Final note -- the duck tofu is wonderful, but they only have it every once in awhile, so grab it if you see it!",Ok Lah
264,"Ok first, big attitude as if they bothered by being a waiter.   Second,  bread not authentic lacked density and crust.  Had better flavors of food at local pizza joint    Will not be going back.   And worst don't think they care","Not really worth it. I went because of the mention from my favorite HBO series, but the food was mediocre and the person waiting our table was a bit on the rude side. Won't be going back but it's mostly due to the food. Wasn't that tasty. And the price for a soda was insane.",I've been going to don Peppe my whole life except in the past 12 years since I moved to Florida. Decided to go there on my way to JFK this recent visit to NY. Food was not as good as I recalled and either was the service. We arrived on the early side for dinner so seating not a problem. However shortly after the place filled up and we were Sandwiched between two large tables . It got real noisy and I started to feel claustrophobic! Overall it was a pricey dinner for two and I can't say I would go out of my way to drop by again.,"One of my favorites.  Every single time - shrimp valenciana as an appetizer, followed by linguine with clams (white) and veal don peppe, one of my favorite dishes in life.Employees are friendly and professional.  Only downside is booze is limited to cold red and white house wine but it's great for the quality and price.","I have been coming to Don Peppe my whole life and have always loved the service and food. My family and I came on a Saturday night during what we thought would be prime-time dinner. We were surprised to see that the restaurant was half-empty but we didn't think twice about it.We ordered the Veal Don Peppe, the Linguini with clams, the stuffed artichoke, and baked clams. The artichoke was the most successful dish of the night as it is nothing short of amazing. The stuffing is plentiful and the sauce is divine. A perfect appetizer for a large meal. The baked clams were also very good and tasty. The Linguini with clams was kind of underwhelming as it could have used a bit more seasoning and maybe a bit more flavor. Lastly, the Veal Don Peppe, (what drew us back here for 20+ years). The flavor and crust of the veal is awesome, but the veal itself was a bit tough. It use to be that you can cut the veal with a spoon and this fell far short of that. The reason I deducted 2 stars is because our waiter wasn't all that attentive and didn't seem like he enjoyed serving us and the food was hit or miss in some areas.Don Peppe is a staple in Queens and it would be difficult to deter me away as I still enjoy the food and experience.","Food: 4/5Came for my friends birthday dinner with 7 other people. We ended up ordering a bunch of dishes -linguine with white sauce, spaghetti with meat sauce, baked clams, stuffed shells, grilled calamari, veal peppe, sodas, beers and a bunch of different desserts.Their linguine with white sauce was out of this world! It was the best clam sauce I've ever had. Their baked clams were also extremely delicious. They were perfectly baked and had the right texture with just the correct amount of bread crumbs.The spaghetti with meat sauce wasn't that impressive. I've had better elsewhere. It was bland. The stuffed shells were just ok. I'm not a big fan of ricotta cheese but I've had better homemade shells. The grilled calamari was a big disappointment. It was way over cooked and lacked the supple texture. The veal peppe was just ok. It was fried and doused in tomato, onions and some sauce. By the time it reached our table, the fried texture was soggy and soft.Service: 5/5Our waiter was extremely courteous and accommodating. He made some great recommendations and he was very friendly.Ambiance: 2/5I was a little disappointed with the feel/vibe of this place. I've heard of Don Peppes before and was expecting more. It's very casual and laid back. No hats, tank tops (for men), baby strollers or credit cards allowed. I felt a bit overdressed. Overall: 4/5This is a no frills, family style Italian restaurant with the best baked clams and linguine with white sauce! I would definitely recommend those two dishes to anyone who wants to give this place a try. I wouldn't recommend anything else. The bill was roughly $500 for our table.Best. Linguine. With white sauce. Ever.",Don Peppe
265,"Came twice. I thought their dimsums were good so I brought my fam and parents over but then the service was horrible. Especially the old man in white shirt, he made me look like I had to beg for tap water. Very very annoying man. Although the dimsum ladies who pushed carts around were kinda friendly, that man were unacceptable. I think he was kinda high level zone manager or something. We were dining with guests too and it was so embarrassing. I think they just dont care about how guests feel bcuz even when there is one bad review, still a line for them. But i wont come back anymore.","Warning:  be aware of overcharging by this restaurant   This place is known for overcharging the dim sum dishesIt's okay that the dim sum dishes at Asian Jewel are more expensive than others, it's not okay for them to cheat their customers.  Our friends and the local newspaper have warned us about this problem.   After dim sum when we received the bill, we counted the dishes and not surprisingly we were overcharged.  I confronted with the staff. As I took out my phone to record the confrontation, the manager had a nerve to say to throw my phone awayDuring that confrontation, the two customers before overheard and checked their bills   They found out that they were overcharged too.  It doesn't seem to be an coincidence to me.This is a very dishonest practice. Please be careful.","What a ridiculous place, we spend 10.95 for almost empty clam. We ask manager about this situation, that fucking old man with glasses said we eat all clam, and leave empty shell to ask new one clam. We come to this place for all the time, now we have this situation, and we realize this place under grade pending, what a fucking restaurant, never come to there again.","This place was delicious, fast, and reasonably priced. We came as a party of three for weekend brunch, and we were seated almost immediately. The place is huge and looks fairly new or at least remodeled. Tea was served immediately and luckily the carts were abound so we didn't have to wait!We ordered almost everything we saw and liked pretty much all of it. I don't remember how much it came out to be but seemed reasonably priced. The carts ladies were nice enough although maybe a little pushy. We loved the regular stuff that is generally good anywhere (shumai, har gao, etc) but also branched out and tried other stuff and were pleasantly surprised. The bathroom is small and cramped, but what can you expect. Would definitely return if I were in the area again! Not sure howit compares to other Dim Sum places in Flushing but as a visitor, it was great!","Asian Jewels has been consistent in their dim sum dishes. Although it can be pricey, it dives a delicious brunch. I took a friend to try dim sum for the first time and she felt in love immediately. She was amazed how much food carts were revolving around our table. There is a free valet parking lot next to the restaurant. The restaurant gets really pack starting 10 am and there is approximately 10 mins wait after 11 am. I usually order shiu mai, fried taro, pork ribs, rice roll and sticky rice. The portion can be a little smaller but they are made fresh. All dishes were flavorful and not salty or dull. Dishes can be oily, but it is dim sum. They are better than other dim sum restaurants (from my experience). The service was pretty good depending where you seat. If you seat far from the corner, it is hard to get anyone. Usually I seat where there are more carts passing by and avoid corner side. I definitely recommend Asian Jewels or at least to try.","If you're like me and you'd rather sample a little bit of everything on a menu than stick with one entree, a dim sum feast is probably your jam. This is why buffets are so popular, a medley of quiche, California rolls, and jello is sometimes all you really want. Dim sum is an especially good place to take all your indecisive friends because you can just point at various delights on the pushcarts that come around the restaurant, no menu required. The options offered at Asian Jewels include the classics-- you'll find siu mai, rice rolls, turnip cakes, har gow, chicken feet, and tripe galore. One of my favorite dishes is seared shrimp ball in eggplant. I'm not sure what it's actually called but that's how I'd describe the dish. They're not doing anything super creative but they really don't need to reinvent the wheel. Dim sum is good just the way it is.Be sure to ask if the dish is hot before you accept it off the cart, because we definitely got a lot of room temperature/cold dishes that have been sitting around for a while, which is not unusual at a dim sum restaurant. Definitely get the egg tarts, theirs are so so good.We were fortunate enough to book one of their private rooms, so we could be as loud as we wanted as we feasted to our hearts content. Did you know that dim sum translates to ""touch your heart"" in Cantonese? I really do think dim sum touches the heart, especially with the right company.",Asian Jewels Seafood Restaurant
266,"While the service is good, this place was a disappointment - especially from all the positive reviews reviews.We had oysters (delicious) and the cheese board (VERY tiny, totally blah).My boyfriend ordered the fish taco's (3 MINIATURE TACOS with NO side - literally 2 bite's each to finish) for $24, which is absolutely ridiculous. I had the mushroom risotto, which was watery and bland (so, not really risotto) for almost $20. Both were VERY bland. We also had two cocktails which we both found incredibly strong and not really worth the $12 cost. Go for the raw bar - that's about it.","Food cook correctly , menu looks yummy but seasoning was on the dull side. Nothing I ate made my taste buds pop. For example the caminare, it's crispy but has no flavoring it almost taste like layas potato  chips.

Kale salad, a dozen oysters, and a couple stingy pours of gruner set me back almost 75 bucks and that's with oysters being on special. Menu's so weirdly overpriced that it's as if the dollar amounts on the burger (3$ up charge for cheese?!), small plate kale salad (17$), and other unpretentious fare are typos. Service is perfunctorily friendly but scattershot. They were half full yet totally slammed last time I went. Need to find another local go-to.","Mar's deserves nothing less than four stars, but we also probably won't be back anytime soon given the prices.The atmosphere was rustic-romantic and comfortable and there was an eclectic mix of patrons, from groups of 30-somethings at the bar to significantly older couples/friends at tables. People were generally dressed smart casual but there were also people in sweatshirts, so it seems to that you can wear whatever you like and fit right in. There were a few hitches with the menu/service. A couple of things we tried to order from the menu were unavailable, and I was a little bummed that some of the items listed on the website were no longer being served. We ordered four different types of oysters from Prince Edward Island, but instead were given two of those and two varieties from VT and CT. That was fine, but as it turned out, the oysters from the U.S. were pretty bland.On the other hand, the alpine and sweet petite oysters from PEI were excellent. I felt like I was licking the ocean, and I mean that as a compliment.We also ordered the fish tacos and mushroom risotto. The fish tacos at $8 per piece were great, but pricey. The fish (cod) was melt-in-your-mouth and accompanied by subtle citrus flavors, juicy cabbage, and a citrusy-spicy creamy sauce. The corn taco wasn't dry like many of the taco shells I've had. The creamy mushroom risotto had a powerful truffle aroma, but the truffle flavor was just right. The risotto was cooked very nicely.I had two drinks: a cocktail and a glass of Bordeaux. I can't find the name of the cocktail anywhere but it was composed of bourbon, scotch, maple, orange bitters, and orange peel. It was simple but very good: smoke, sweetness, and citrus. We shared the chocolate ganache. It was very, very good. The dark chocolate and light crumbly cookie bottom were accompanied by sea salt, a caramel drizzle, and, amazingly, fried sprigs of rosemary. I believe tonight marks my first fried rosemary sprig. Finally, we ordered coffees, which were a bit burnt. All in all, we did order numerous items but still ended up with a $160 bill, which is just a bit more than the two of us want to pay for a typical night out on Astoria.","The decor is nice enough but last night was one of the worst and overpriced meals I've had in a long time. The salad was the highlight, but $17 for a small, tiny, minuscule salad that include no meats cheese or any ingredient of high value felt like a complete robbery. The poutine ($14) was not good or even satisfying. The cheeseburger ($19) was well done, dense and lacking in any moisture or flavor. The must ask Who tops a burger with two cherry tomatoes?  Wtf??  The chicken was tasty but a 1/2 breast with literally a few veggies for $22 is again robbery. Plus two glasses of wine and we ended the night at $105 + tip. Must be paying for ambiance cause Astoria has soooo many better options at this and far lower price points. Maybe we should have only ordered oysters. Argh","Very cute, rustic decor. Staff was dressed nicely in speakeasy-esque garb. And I arrived in a T-shirt and jeans... No judgment, right? I also liked how quiet it was on Super Bowl Sunday, but who knows maybe it's always like that on Sundays.Waitress recommended a nice red wine for me based on my preferences and my entree. Mushroom Ravioli app - B+ (delicious and expensive, you only get 2)Poutine - C (soggy fries and tough burrata, and really shouldn't be on the entrees list)Calamari Marinara - A+",Mar's
267,I ordered food from these guys at around 8pm. It's 10:15pm now. My food never came. I called 8 times and there was no response. Kept going to a machine that says that the TimeWarner Cable customer hasn't set up their voicemail. They're supposed to be good. But I guess I'll never know.,Pricy for basic fish with tomato sauce and rice and onions: not sure what kind of fish it tasted a touch rubbery. No seasoning or grilling and as I write this I'm continuing to talk myself down from four stars and settling on three.,Nasty unkept place. Why would anyone eat in this dirty place. Nothing tasty or appealing about their food. I'd stay away if I was U.,the whole family works here and they're all such nice people. i've been here twice and both times the food is just amazing. the branzino comes to you charred black with a delicious shell of seasoning but still a very tender on the inside. the egyptian moussaka is a fried eggplant dish with tomato sauce on top that is so ungodly i've gotten it both times i've come here. i highly recommend this gem of a place for everyone to try!,"#Came by to check out the food, since I had to return my Verizon #FiOS equipment nearby. The Koshary is kind of like pasta, but with Middle Eastern spices. Nice people.Realized the next day, I forgot to return my #FiOS remote. Thought maybe it was a good excuse to come back to Little Egypt. But turns out I don't need to return it.","This place is a true gem! The food is amazing, and the family who runs it is so wonderful and sweet. I recommend the Moussaka! Massive portions for very low prices.",Little Egypt
268,"I have eaten at the Chinatown location many times but didn't know that there is a location in Queens til now. Although size of the pho is smaller than at Pho Bac's, the pho broth was tasty and hotter. There is an option to order extra broth, which I did, then just swiped some of my husband's noodles and beef.","Came in to eat lunch and we only came for the pho. Let me tell you, we all noticed that the portions have decreased and it is very noticeable.  While the soup was good, not great we all agreed that portions were small and no consistency. All the soups had a little bit of tripe but not all the tripe was thinly sliced. Some were and other were left in big chunks that are difficult to chew. Not sure if i will have soup here anymore. This spot has been reliable for a long time and somehow they have lost their mojo.","I'm just visiting from out of town. After being away for three years, I stopped in at what use to be one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants.I can't say that anymore.Service was very poor. After getting our food I had to ask for napkins twice before getting any at all. There were five of us, we ordered Pho. They gave us two set ups of mint leaves and bean sprouts for the Pho. Then after two minutes a waiter came and took one of those setups back. Even though each setup was enough for one person only.We ordered three rainbow drinks that never came but they were on our bill!Their Pho tasted like hot water. Their soft shell crab was soft and soggy. And did I mention their poor service?Yeah, their service deserved no tip. But my wife insisted on giving one.This turned into a really cheap tasteless place!!!","I thought this was a Thai place when it was suggested to me as a dinner destination, but going on Yelp revealed it to be a Vietnamese joint. And not sure if the name is supposed to be a play on Tyson? Anyway, Thai Son was a snappy jaunt from the Roosevelt Avenue Jackson Heights stop. Two of us were seated quickly. We split the vegetarian spring rolls (small $5.25) as an appetizer and then I requested the grilled pork bun ($8.75) as my main. We also shared an order of the sauteed Chinese mushrooms with vegetables ($11.95) as a side.  The rolls were miniature and not particularly memorable. I'd try another appetizer next time. I was quite happy with my bun which had lots of tender pork and noodles though I was giving my dinner buddy's pho the occasional envious eye since it looked appetizing. The mushrooms were also rather tasty. Service was okay, almost treading into brusque territory, but never rude or anything. Thai Son is not the place for lingering; they want you to eat and leave. And I wish they would itemize your receipt.","Best Vietnamese Restaurant! If you want cheap and authentic Vietnamese restaurant go here!!Location: It is located in Elmhurst! I always go here when I moved to the U.S. The restaurant is big with a lot of seatings! The interior is okay, you go here for food so it is okay if its like a normal restaurant.Service: They are okay, they just take your order and that's it. :)Food: Everything is good here! PHO: all the phos are good!! The noodles are perfectly cook but the main thing is here the soup, it is soo delicious! PORKCHOP: omg they are soo good, thinly sliced and marinated well! Dip it on their sauce that taste like vinegar with fish sauce! PAPAYA SALAD: so refreshing! Sliced fresh with shrimp and bits of cashew!!Price rating: 4/10 very cheap with the kind of goodness they offer!Get the porkchop they are the bomb!! The Pho is good as well! Perfect for any kind of weather!","Lived in the area for 10+ years but never came here until Pho Bang closed down. Was a little skeptical since I wasn't a fan of their Chinatown location but this one is definitely better! Conveniently located across from the main Roosevelt and 74th train station hub, Thai Son is open quite late and serves up amazing pho! The pho soup doesn't taste too greasy or meaty, almost refreshing and light. Their pork chop vermicelli is also delicious. Plus, the wait staff are actually pleasant which is a nice change of pace from other viet places.",Thái Son
269,"Lunch before an appointment in my former hood Forest Hills, Queens summons my appetite for Japanese Bento Box.  At first impression this business appears very quiet and empty after lunch rush hour of 2:29 pm,  but the quality of food is mediocre.  Customer service is average.  Japanese matcha green tea is not offered upon being seated, but cold water is provided... at least offer green tea to customers!  Business cards and takeout menus are available for grabs.B3. Pork Katsu lunch box special $11.95One large ball of rice, California roll, shumai, choice of soup or salad.  The sushi rolls were not solid as upon pickup using chopsticks it broke apart and fallen onto my Bento Box tray.  The shumai was average.  The rice is average Carolina, but not Jasmine.  The pork was immensely dry hard and way overcooked.  The Panko bread crumbs dried out the pork as it way overcooked and the pork was very hard.  The pork tasted like eating a rock.  It was very bland despite of applying Japanese curry sauce.  It was hard to intake this entree.  The salad dressing was a mayo dressing and the green appears similar to kale lettuce as I always prefer regular lettuce.  I am enamored with traditional Japanese ginger dressing, but this business do not use.  I agree with a previous Yelper that their soy sauce is very diluted with water embedded (or possibly they don't use Kikkoman).","I was craving chirashi and this was the only place nearby. The fish is mediocre. Nothing was spoiled, but fish was not the best [quality]. The salad dressing was nice and light, not as strong as most are. The sushi rice definitely needs more seasoning. I'm really upset that their soy sauce is watered down (or they don't use kikkoman). Overall, I would not come back.Update: TMI but I diarrhea'ed right when I came home. May or may not be related","I recently ordered delivery from here. A few of us shared a large platter of sushi and sashimi. It was good, had no issue with it, but within an hour or two, all 3 of us had an upset stomach, mine lasting until the next day or two. I called the restaurant and let them know (I'll always call just in case, it could happen to someone else). They seemed unphased. ""No one else got sick,"" or ""we've been open since 10am and no problems."" I told them I was just letting them know, to be on the safe side. It just felt very defensive/accusatory. I was not looking for anything free or compensation, just wanted to let them know...All in all, will not be ordering from here again.","I was wary of this place, given its name, but was recommended it by my boss who I trust has very good taste (he lives in Flushing), so decided to give it a try with Seamless. I was pretty impressed with the quality at first bite. In fact I liked it so much I made a 2nd order immediately after for my husband who was on his way home. (Sorry to the delivery guy who had to come all the way to my apartment twice!)I then decided to come in-person with a friend last week and we were both impressed even more! The raw fish was really fresh and the prices were pretty reasonable (we both spent under $25 each including tip and tax) for 2 special rolls and 2 regular rolls - total of 28 nice sized pieces). The sushi rice seems well seasoned (not just plain white rice) and the seaweed they use for the rolls is higher quality than any sushi place I've been to in Forest Hills so far (and I've been to almost all of them). I hope they keep up the quality and keep the prices affordable! Delicious and have been telling many of my friends and neighbors about it!","This place is a stone's throw away from where I live and I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars, but I don't want to be part of rating inflation.It's a sushi restaurant so if the food is garbage, it will obviously not last long. But from the few times I've been there, the food was just fine, decent in portion and good in quality, I've had their bento box before and liked it just fine. But it's on Austin St., so it has to appeal to people who don't just want good food; they want an experience. The time I took my roommate out for his birthday and they served us a large portion of sushi and sashimi on what a serving board with... colored lights. I flat-out asked ""Why are you serving sushi and sashimi with colored light?"" She looked very confused and said ""That's how we always do it."" I ate from the curious serving board thinking ""They're on restaurant row here so they have to stand out. But man, they are trying way too hard.""Good food, if you always go to Austin St. I'm sure you'll like this place just fine, but the ambiance, the differentiating gimmicks, I don't care for those. The restaurant row location drives up prices and necessitates gimmicks and I'd rather go find something elsewhere that is dirt cheap and wonderful. A little effort goes a long way.","I've been here way too many times to count because my mom loves this place. I'm not too sure why because I think it's just okay at best. If you do come here, the hot appetizers are probably the best on the menu. I like the boneless teriyaki wings and chicken negisaki. For me the pork buns here are not tender and not well flavored. The tempura is just okay; there is a bit too much tempura flour that is sloppily battered. The sushi is ok. I would say that it's hard to mess up on soft shell crab. I got the black widow which had eel and soft shell crab. The cucumber roll was also just average. At the very least bamboo ya is consistently mediocre.",Bamboo Ya
270,"If I have to rate the food it's 4-5 and if I have to rate the service it's a solid 1-2. So I'm middle grounding. Food: I usually get a combo stonepotted bulgogi and mix soondubu medium spice cause come on now did you ever see the nonspicy one? It's legit egg water. And if you can't handle spice, what are you doing at a Korean restaurant. Their haemul pajun is a safe choiceService: is the reason I'm always reluctant about going. The time before the last visit here we had 3 orders of the combos and I'm trying to remember all 3 of our orders and I mistakenly said the soups first then I said oh these are all combos mind you in Korean. The servers goes mam, you don't order like that in a very disgruntled toned. Like woman, it's a minor mistake you can write it out correctly. Not only that, but there was one Spanish worker that legit smell like BO. I'm all about providing opportunities but if your employee smells like BO in customer service and of all things food industry where you come across the customers, you should be taking action. Either they should be disciplined or they should be working in the back.","I came here for a friend's birthday. I didn't love their menu choices, thought there would be more options. I was disappointed because bbq option wasn't available to order. We orders a mix of apps and tofu soup. I was surprised at how good the food was and the price was fairly reasonable. Not sure if I would come back but I do recommend trying it once.","Went there for lunch on 8/10/19 and place was crowded so that is always a good sign.  However upon closer review the place was FILTHY. When wife went to ladies room there was dead cockroach plus bay window had large amount of spider webs. Additionally the kids play area also had spider webs and half filled cup.  That just shows that they don't clean up often if at all.  We ordered lunch special and kids menu. (Kalbi with cold noodles with chilled beef broth, bi bimbap with dumpling tofu soup) After eating food wife and I was very tired and son got diarrhea. I think the food had high amounts of MSG.  Lunch special is over $20 and while I overlooked high price in the past after this will not be coming here again.","Casual Korean restaurant. The restaurant has a parking lot which is a great convenience for northern queens. I came here for lunch with a colleague. We ordered some kale and spinach dumplings. They were crispy and tasty. The entrees come with a lot of sides so an appetizer maybe a little too much food for some people.I ordered the soy bean tofu dish. It was not a spicy dish. It was earthy and savory. The entrees come with side dishes including kimchi, brocoli, bean sprouts, pickles, and mushrooms. The service was very quick.","Great experience for my first visit..They bring out a bunch of stuff including kimchee,  pickles, broccolie, squid salad, cold crab salad with cucumber, etc to munch onReally enjoyed the seafood soup with some spice to it.Had the bbq beed ribs","After being excited to go to KBBQ for a week, I made my encounter with a throat infection so bye bye KBBQ and hello BCD soondubu! Located in the heart of Ktown, BCD tofuhouse has brought consistent, delicious tofu stew for many years. You can count on this place to be FAST and to be oh so delicious. I arrived on a Friday afternoon at 1:00pm and was seated immediately with my party of 4. Note: they don't let you sit until your entire party arrives so plan accordingly! As BCD is a chain, you can expect their signature fried fish and banchans which regularly consist of veggies, spicy squid, pickles, fish cake and their fresh kimchi. I ordered the Kimchi soondubu which comes with a choice of pork/beef. I opted for the pork because I wanted a kimchichigae feel (kimchi stew that is traditionally made with pork). I chose mild for the spice level because of my throat infection and because I REALLY didn't want to get the plain flavor (that's just tofu water to me). As expected the food was hearty, flavorful and came quickly. Served with a bowl of Korean sticky rice and burnt tea rice, this was the perfect comfort food.I highly recommend eating at BCD. I think what stands out here is the exceptionally quick service and the consistently delicious food. BCD is the perfect ""go-to"" spot because it is a staple that just doesn't disappoint.",BCD Tofu House
271,"Worse service ever, the waiter very rude, the staff is rude , messed the order, mr attitude waiter sat down across from us eating his food completely ignoring our Table. Now on the menu it states happy hour 3:30-6:30pm. The waiter said we don't do happy hour strike 1, I order roasted chicken, came back 10 minutes nope we don't have any chicken today another strike. We order steak sandwiches with fries on my order. The worse  fries not fresh ! Don't waste your time or money on this restaurant!","We are in the neighborhood because we are staying near the airport for our flight tomorrow. We wanted a good dinner for our last night in NYC. We ordered the steak, chicken, rabbit and octopus. The octopus was perfectly cooked, firm on the outside and still soft on the inside, without being undercooked. The steak was ok too, but the chicken and rabbit were over cooked and dry! We couldn't even eat the rabbit, and this is something we enjoy. Even worse, when we complained about the rabbit they took it away and didn't even offer anything in compensation. Full charge!","Dont know why this place has almost 5 stars. I am gonna have to hold back on using profanity. Came on mother's day to treat my mom to a seemingly nice restaurant - was convinced from the photos and reviews. We were given a piece of paper as a Mother's Day special (understandable since it was a holiday) but it was rather weird to not be given the regular menu on the side. Most restaurants during holidays give special menus alongside their original ones. Nonetheless it was very limited so we asked for the original menu and we were immediately cut off with rudeness by the waiter. Told us that WAS the menu and there was no other menu. After a few moments, my brother asked a different guy for the original menu and he finally gave it to us. When we wanted to order, the guy snapped at us and said 'hold on!!' but we only asked once. All the food was subpar. Dont ever ask for the chicken sandwich. They literally just put a strip of grilled chicken between two pieces of bread. No sauce, no lettuce, nothing. I also feel they only cater to their regulars because of their unwelcoming behavior towards anyone else.TL; DR: Incredibly rude service. Below average, dry and EXPENSIVE food. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I feel bad because my poor mom didn't enjoy her meal.",Great Portuguese food at very reasonable prices. You won't be disappointed for steak and seafood. Walking distance from Jamaica train station LIRR. Oh and they have off street parking available.,"Sunday lunch here was not planned but street parking was available. Walked into a bar scene where everyone stares at you like you don't belong (western movie style). The guy behind the bar greets us and tells us to sit anywhere we wanted. The dining tables are in the back, covered with white table cloth. When you sit, they give complementary bread with butter and olives. The bread was cold so that sucked. I ordered the steak on stone $24, this came with fries which I changed for a salad. The salad was iceberg lettuce with some baby tomatoes and onions, nothing special. The steak looked about 9oz and came out sizzling. It looks delicious, however I think it was lacking flavor. A good steak can be great with just some salt and pepper but this one was missing something. So the steak kept sizzling on the stone for about 15 minutes, causing oil splatter on the table, clothing ... I had to hold the napkin up to avoid the greasy splatter, see pics. Overall, it was ok. Not planning on coming back but not hating it either. If I'm really hungry and there's nothing else I'll eat here but I won't go outta my way.",You cannot go wrong with Portuguese food and you won't go wrong eating here. Today was Mother's Day and they had a special menu. I chose the spinach soup as a starter. Savoury and thick based stock with a hint of bacon flavor. Thin strips of fresh spinach along with tasty sausage. For the main course I chose the suckling pig with a hot garlic oil sauce and thinly sliced homemade potato chips. The pig was crispy on the outside and tender and moist on the inside.  The staff were pleasant and the service was quick.,A-Churrasqueira Restaurant & Bar

They have several dishes that you usually don't see at other Japanese restaurants such as oden. The location is a little unusual, hidden under the subway in a area with not many other restaurants but definitely worth going off the beaten path for. You can get sushi and ramen combinations!","Awesome low key place in LIC! They have really great prices for the quality of food. Last time I came I ordered a draft Sapporo for 4 dollars, and the ramen + sushi roll combo for about 14.  Usually, I order the ""duet"" or ""trio"" sushi roll combo, which is 11 or 14 bucks depending on how many rolls you want.The space is great, I love sitting at the bar which is quiet and a perfect spot for a date or to have a solo dinner. The sushi rolls are of the best quality I have had in LIC/Astoria. Really tasty, fresh, and holds together well. The fish is also the right temperature and not too cold masking the flavor. The ramen was pretty good too. No broth choice, but that's okay. The broth that comes with the ramen is somewhat sweet, but they provide some spicy chili oil that you can use to liven up the broth. The roast pork was super tender and fell apart in my chopsticks. The egg was over cooked unfortunately (hard boiled... I think soft boiled or medium is more traditional), but that was really my only complaint.Service is good. A tiny bit slow getting the check but that's just because they don't want to rush you out.  Other than that, they are friendly and happy to talk to you about the menu. Also, they have a unique happy hour deal -- free chicken wings with the purchase of a drink! I will definitely keep coming back. Love this spot.","Great small sushi place with very friendly people. We ordered the cheaper sashimi option and it was just okay, maybe the more expensive option is better. The Alaskan and Philadelphia rolls were amazing. I highly recommend trying out the soft shell crab (appetizer), it was amazing in flavor and crunchiness. However, make sure to check your bill carefully as the bills were hand-written by the servers and it's prone to have mistakes when it's busy time. Our bill were added more items of the nearby table (which we did not order) but we believe these were genuine mistake. The restaurant was full when we dine in (dinner time Friday night).","This quiet Japanese sushi bar/restaurant has warmth, good food, and notable service that its outside appearance may not suggest.Coming for an early dinner, we were greeted and served by a cute older Japanese woman who gave us recommendations and charm.We ordered a Salmon Teriyaki dinner box [Salmon teriyaki, ginger salad, california roll, fresh fruit] and the Astoria Roll.Everything came quickly and tasted freshly made! The dinner box even came with a small miso soup which wasn't too salty. The salmon was cut-thin,  flavorful, and not too sweet. The ginger salad had a spicier ginger dressing which I appreciated.The Astoria Roll was generous in size but nothing special.A great place to have a light dinner/snack and they have a happy hour deal that gives you an order of chicken wings with any alcoholic drink purchased!",Suzuki Shokudo
275,Disgusting. Found a nail in my food!Wish I would have snapped a picture before I threw it out. Garbage.,I asked that the taco toppings come on the side and was told that would consist of a separate dish and additional charges.  I will never recommend a restaurant that has items listed with a dish and do not offer as a side...... Not only that a true Mexican taco is meat onions and cilantro...... This place have a list of items they put on a taco....Thank you for responding. The only reason you responded is because it is LIVE AND ON THE WEB. Never once did you or your staff feel a need to communicate to me about my concerns.  Because I raised these very concerns before posting.  If you were so concerned about my well being one of your employees or yourself since you have so much to say NOW. HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE ME,"Embarrassing. On Mother's Day. That waiter is the definition of failure. Spot has so much potential, and we really drove because of yelp. What an embarrassment.","After the best meal I've had in the area I am plotting how to convince my wallet that I can in fact afford to come here every night for dinner. I'm a stickler when it comes to guacamole and Paloma's wowed me with the freshest, most flavor balanced guacamole I've had in a long time. The ingredients were obviously fresh, ripe, and it was made to order. The steak fajita my partner got was sizzling and delicious (sorry babe, I ate your leftovers last night ‍) and my enchiladas were so good I had no leftovers I don't give 5 stars often, perhaps not ever on here, but they earned it!","Excellent Mexican food very reasonably priced.Killer guacamole and the fried avocado slices with the chipotle dipping sauce is a textural masterpiece!Our server was friendly and everything was prepared and delivered on time.I'm not a big fan of cilantro and they made accommodations for me when preparing the food.My daughters had the sangria which I thought was a little on the sweet side, but they liked it.I will be back!","Just read the last review and everything was completely false! The food here is always amazing! The staff is always friendly and never disappoints with their quality of service. Have been coming to this place since it opened and can I just say it's the best of the best.Let's begin with some of the food: Appetizers My top 4 are the Nachos (steak and the shrimp are a must!), corn in the cob (man the sauce is to die for you can literally scoop it up with some of the nachos and it's amazing alone) avocado fries ( these are breaded to perfection and a small bite of heaven paired with the sauce on the side it's one of my favorites) and my last to top off the top appetizer list the quesadilla (steak is my preference but I have heard that the chicken is great as well)For Mains: My staple is the chimichanga de carnitas ( think of a burrito but to the next level!!) it's a beautifully deep fried piece of heaven with carnitas, cheese, rice and beans. Quite an amazing meal that will leave you filled and satisfied.The Fajitas (a must is to have the steak and shrimp together) it's a little more for the two meats but WORTH EVERY PENNY PAID! The flavors are amazing and pair well with the traditional sides of tortillas rice beans and guacamole and sour cream!My other fave is the Steak!!! Man o man this dish right here is everything!! The steak is a perfect cut and cooked to your liking with the side of potatoes and a perfect sauce to pair everything together is the best!For those who are seeking to wet their whistle don't forget the Sangria (hands down the best) or a Michelada which they pair with your beer of choice!Overall a great place and as a client for more then 2 years it's been a great experience looking forward to see what Paloma's will put out next!!!",Paloma's
276,"First time visiting this place...The atmosphere, food and the guy behind the counter was great very polite and welcoming... But the waitresses they were rude and inattentive. (Especially greek old lady with glasses)  Well only with me the rest of the customers they would ask them if they needed anything or if the food was ok..(the other customers were all Caucasian) I should've left the minute she ask me to change from the booth table and sit towards the back.. Everyone else sat wherever they like and it was no problem... smh! All paying customers should be treated equal no matter what race they are...","Unlike real life, this establishment is the family that never lets you down. I usually order the lamb souvlaki but I urge others to play menu Russian Roulette as every dish they serve seems to be an absolute banger. Small and unassuming, you will find that Family Corner is the ultimate dark horse of Greek diners in Astoria.","Great spot for a quick breakfast/lunch or brunch. We came here spur of the moment and certainly weren't disappointed. I loved their chicken wrap! And my boyfriend loved his omelet. Whenever we're back in New York, we'll have to stop here and grab a bite with the NYFD.","Love everything about this place! Breakfast is always on point- lunch and dinner probably are too, but it's diner food, so lets be real Breakfast is the way to go at any time of day. Oh, and their blueberry muffin pretty much changed my life! My only complaint is that they're not open on Sundays, but being as Family as they are I get it, they need a day. I just wish their chosen day was maybe Tuesday? because I've certainly needed that blueberry muffin on a Sunday morning more than once!","My boyfriend and I came here this morning. We were actually on our to grab bagels and decided to stop in here instead! It's a small cozy place but we had no trouble grabbing a table. I believe this place is cash only, so make sure you have some on you. They do also have delivery on yelp and grubhub as well though. We were told to take a seat whoever and sat in the back. The waitress came over soon and took our drink order. We decided to order a bacon egg and cheese and blueberry pancakes. Everything came out fast and was cooked perfectly. The only complaint I would have is that I wish my pancakes had more blueberries! Overall though all the people were friendly, the atmosphere is a local cozy diner and the food was delicious. My apartment is relatively close so I'm sure I'll be back or ordering online from them soon! Nice addition to the neighborhood.","Idk why I havent reviewed them sooner....Been coming here for yearsssssssss! The owners and staff are the best! It's definitely called family corner for a reason, you literally feel like family in there. The portions are great, made with quality ingredients and are fairly priced. Almost everything is homemade from scratch (obviously the non homemade exceptions are fries and mozzarella sticks, stuff like that). Wether you want a burger, breakfast, salad or a nice comforting & Authentic Greek dish this is your place. I promise you wont be disappointed.",Family Corner Restaurant
277,"I should have left after we ordered our drinks. Probably the least welcoming least comfortable restaurant I have ever been in.It was like a circus. We were seated in a room where there were obviously 2 to 3 parties going on. The bus boys were setting up and taking down table settings and literally sliding chair after chair, across the floor- opening Up folding tables and banging them on the floor to set up and open. Throwing table cloths up  in the air -   all with total disregard for the diners who were sitting around. My husband, however, always the laid back guy, wanted to stick it out so we did. I requested a table change - which we got - and that room was slightly less circus-like.  Anyway the  food was okay but certainly not worth the $70 for 2 pasta dishes and a salad in a horrible environment.","Underwhelming. Service was okay nothing special, waiter took a while to come take our order. Food came out really quick (not even 10 minutes) which makes me question the quality of the food since it seems everything is premade. Pasta was bland, pizza was bland artichoke dip was definitely pre made and warmed up as the center was cold. School food version of Italian cuisine. Not to mention their prices aren't justified by their food.","Can here four times. The first two times the food was great. The last two times food was really not good at all. Service the last time was horrible, waiter never came around at all till it was time for the check. It's a older looking place, could use a remodeling since it's a nice big space.","If you are looking for excellent food and incredible service, this is your place!We had my son's rehearsal dinner here a few nights ago, and it couldn't have been more perfect! The separate room was exactly what we needed, and our servers (Andrea and Janine) were beyond amazing! Theresa was incredibly helpful in the planning and choosing the menu, and Armen was my contact the night of the event - he was wonderful - so helpful and kind.The food was delicious - the guests were raving about it all night - start to finish, this was the best experience I've ever had hosting an event. I highly recommend Dee's if you're having a party! (It's also excellent if you're just going out for dinner!) I don't know why this posted twice, but I still feel the same, so it's all good :)","If you are looking for excellent food and incredible service, this is your place!We had my son's rehearsal dinner here a few weeks ago, and it couldn't have been more perfect!

This quaint restaurant serves homemade pasta and brick over pizza. I've enjoyed both. Neither one disappoints. Their focaccia bread is everything, plus more! I've enjoyed their meatballs, pesto pasta, tacos (yes, tacos at an Italian restaurant), and pizza for lunch and dinner. I've dined here for lunch and dinner. It doesn't matter the time of day, their service is up to par.It has a main dining room and a another room that also serves as a private party room for guests. They have a full bar. I have tried their white wine options. Their options aren't any different from other nearby restaurants, but they are enjoyable.Happy Dining!",Dee's
278,"Boneless chicken or drumsticks with spicy sauce are to die for! The sweet potato fries with the chipotle aioli sauce are a great combo too. They also have lambic in a few different flavors, so that's a plus for me. My only complaint so far has been the kimchi fried rice. It lacked flavor and just wasn't very good. It's still one of my favorite spots for fried chicken!","Enjoy the vast beer selection but the wings are sometimes hit or miss. They lack soy garlic sauce at sometimes, therefore not tasting as great as they can be. Most recently, been disappointed with the lack of sauce when ordering and didn't have an enjoyable meal because of it. If they add a good amount of sauce for your order of wings consistently, I think I can give at least one more star because that is what I would mainly come for.","Wings were delicious but i was expecting a more balanced assortment of both parts of the wings.  There were, literally, 2 pieces of the flat or middle part of the wing.  This was my substitute bday dinner at home thanks to a sick kid.  And the other kid ate those 2 flat pieces.  #sadbirthdaygirlhere #parentingsacrifices  but also","Thursday night, wanted to try something different in the area (i.e. not mexican or halal food). Thankfully this chicken joint is open late and has an inviting interior boot. Easily able to get a table as not many people were there.Menu has a surprising number of food options aside from chicken as well as a solid craft beer list. Settled for the Two-Piece Drumsticks ($6), Coconut Fried Shrimp ($10), and a draft beer ($8). Drumsticks are slathered in a sweet and spicy sauce that are cooked well. Fried shrimp is definitely heavy on the oil and coconut, but cut nicely with the side of aioli. Service here is quick and accommodating, as the waitress gave some suggestions. Definitely better than I expected, so will gladly come back.","Actually, I came here because of the beer selection and ended up with some of the best wings I've ever eaten. I couldn't decide on what sauce to get on my wings so the waiter suggested that I get both, 3 wings with Soy Garlic and 3 with BBQ Mustard. The BBQ Mustard ended being a lot spicier than I would have guessed, but delicious.I chose to go downstairs because a) it's less crowded and b) I think I read somewhere that that's where you need to be to order beer. Regardless, that's where I posted.While I'm happy to give 5 stars for the AMAZING beer selection and the quality of the food I ate, one thing was a little weird. The aforementioned waiter, when I asked about one of the beers, told me that he didn't drink and didn't know anything about them. Oh well, I guess I'll have to rough it. ;-)","Nice and quiet ambience. The staff very welcoming, helpful and fast services. Menu is very simple and easy. I was in the neighborhood and stop by since i grew a new found love for Korean fried chicken. The price was very good. Bill came up to 42.00 for two ppl which was very decent. The food is good portion size and food cooked to perfection no complaints. The peach ice tea was delicious and you get free refills. They also have draft beers and draft beers to go. Good spot for date and quiet outing. I ordered 3 drum sticks and 6 wings. I'm happy you can pick two sauces, i didn't like that it was so much sauce compared to other places and the soy garlic was to much soy flavored but still delicious. The cheese fries were good enough to share for two people",Unidentified Flying Chickens
279,"Terrible, TERRIBLE service... The right hand does not know about the left hand experience. We had a reservation for our grandfather's bday dinner (6 people) for 7pm, got there 30 minutes before, sat down 30 minutes passed our reservation time. 25 minutes later later (we are now an closed to an hour passed 7), no waiter ever comes to the table. After complaining for the lack of service, a waiter came over to say ""he'll be right over"". again, 10 more minutes passed before we all decide to head out and over to another restaurant. waiter comes to the table as we are ready to leave, we communicated the reason why and his reply was very nonchalant ""ok"". In my opinion, if you are about to spend a few hundreds on dinner? do yourself a favor and skip this place. maybe just drinks at the bar.","Went here last week Sat. for the nightlife vibe for a friend's birthday.  We booked bottle service 3 days in advance.  We were advised to select the Sliver Package ($300) which includes 1 Liter of premium alcohol and 1 bottle of champagne.  We also requested the birthday add ($50) which includes shots, hookah and a birthday sign with your name on it.  This was booked and confirmed last week Wednesday.  We also called to confirm our package and birthday add on the night of which was last Saturday, everything was in order.  Upon arrival, we were asked to leave a card on file which is normal.  There was a lady in the front with gray hair and red pants who was very condescending.  We asked about our birthday add on and she simply said that was no longer available.  This placed was originally Penthouse 808 but is now The Penthouse under new management I am assuming.  We explained to her that we confirmed this twice and if we knew that this was not an option, we would not have booked bottle service there.  She was very blunt and simply disregarded anything we had to say.The service was terrible.  We arrived to the rooftop area and people were still having dinner with the tables out after midnight!  I came here back in January under Penthouse 808 name and it was an amazing experience.  I don't know who these new people are but they are quite unprofessional.  They were putting tables away during the ""nightlife"" event.  The DJ was terrible, he only played spanish music the entire night.  The placed smelled like mold.  The server attended to us twice which was to bring out the bottles and to clean up!  She never brought out the sign with my friend's name on it.  The place was empty as ever.I don't expect this place to be open very long.  They have completely downgraded their professionalism and customer service.  They are lying to customer to lure them to the place and then denying them services that are offered over the phone!","Another let down of a rooftop bar. Similar to the previous rooftop bar we had checkout on a Friday night, this was way too overcrowded. The music wasn't of ambience, we were expecting lowfi, calm music for our friends from San Francisco but instead we got loud club like music (although this makes me sound like an old lady I'm actually only 22 y.o.) This was a disappointing rooftop bar compared to ones I've been to outside of NYC. What's worse is that they tried to sit us RIGHT IN FRONT OF A SPEAKER and told us that the other tables were reserved (only a few tables actually had reserved signs).","I came here for a wedding dinner. It was a party of about 30 people, the bride and groom had reserved a table on the rooftop.First off, the place itself is gorgeous. You get beautiful views of the Queensboro Bridge and the Manhattan skyline. Five stars is for the service. Sao was great! She was so nice and accommodating. Some guests were being a little extra with the requests and she accommodated everyone. The dinner included unlimited drinks, a choice of two cocktails along with beer and wine. Drinks were flowing throughout the night consistently. They also brought out the cake with sparklers and a little sign congratulating the bride and groom which was really nice of them.The food wasn't great. Honestly, the menu needs work bc I felt like there wasn't a consistent theme. We went from Thai to Peruvian to fried chicken so I was a little confused on what the restaurant has to offer. Most of the food was pretty bland and over cooked.I enjoyed the cilantro lime rice and that's about it. I would probbaly come back for dinner and give it another try because of the amazing service.","I went to Ravel Rooftop ""Penthouse 808"" on September 21st to celebrate a Friend's Birthday dinner.I was a wearing something appropriate for what I thought was dinner. Upon waiting in line the door person singled me out saying "" bro, no sneakers allowed"". I didn't think I needed to be over the top dressed for a dinner at a restaurant that doesn't have any Michelin stars and is a rooftop. He was very disrespectful and rude. At this point I had no desire to get in. I stood there to make sure it wasn't just me but then realized he allowed several patrons to enter in wearing sneakers that were athletic such as nike etc.I on the other hand was wearing a high end brand designer sneaker and wasn't allowed entry because he said they were ""running shoes"".I figured I didn't want to ruin my friend's Birthday so I considered going home to change. My Fiancé exchanged words with the door person with  her displeasure and we left. I drove 30 minutes back home and then back to the venue. After we got back to the venue we were both wearing totally different outfits. Both people working the door clearly recognized it was us. One of the door boys said to the other ""they are back. I walked back up dressed wearing a pair of $1500 SAINT LAURNET PARIS boots so I was sure I wouldn't have any issues getting back in. The tall African American male with the beard who I cursed out earlier said I was fine to enter but my Fiancé was not allowed entry. I was more furious than I was earlier but at I point I decided to go wish friend a Happy Birthday and leave. After being inside I witnessed even more men in sneakers. I immediately left and walked back out  and to my surprise, I saw 4 NYPD officers surrounding my Fiancé. I carefully approached the officers to find out what was the matter. They stated that they received a phone call that a female threatened the door person with a firearm. They asked my Fiancé to leave while she briefly waited for me and when she refuse they deliberately lied and made a false accusation to get the cops there.We were both humilated and disgusted by this entire ordeal. I tend to stay away from low class establishments like these that are run by unprofessional staff. We made several attempts to reach management in regards to this issue and all they said was they would look into it and then they offered complimentary entry to their Sister location. I could care less about a free drink or free entry. I want to make sure this individual is FIRED and he and/or his colleague working the door will never have another chance to work in hospitality ever again.","Been there, done that. And only because my friend had an outstanding Groupon for dinner that she needed to redeem. Located in the Ravel Hotel, we arrived earlier than our reservations but were seated immediately. The space was large and given the time, it was empty. A surplus of staff seemed to be waiting off to the sides for the potential rush later. The views were breathtaking but due to the sizzling temperature, the roof and shades were put in place.  Our table was close to the railing with a full view of the Queensborough Bridge.Our waitress was helpful and service was good. We got things started with the Pacific Sangria cocktail. I liked the combination of flavors but it was a bit on the sweeter side.  At $14 per cocktail, we switched to different ones a bit later.As far as food, we shared the Sushi Burrito which was cut into 4 pieces and strictly vegetarian. With the temperature feeling like 100 degrees, my friend and I were cautious and avoided ordering the raw stuff (nearly impossible since most of the menu was sushi related). In addition, several reviews questioned the freshness of the seafood.In addition to the Sushi Burrito ($14)  we also shared the Cantonese Noodles ($24).In my opinion, both were acceptable but not outstanding. Portions were small. Along with our food, my friend ordered the Blueberry Mojito while I selected the Kentucky Smash. They were meh.I'm a lightweight when it comes to alcohol,  but we agreed that we barely felt a buzz. It wasn't our goal to fall on our faces but we felt as though we drank mocktails.As we were settling the check, the roof and shades were retracted and we took the opportunity to snap a couple photos of the view.  Again, very pretty.Overall, I would not return. Given the prices, quality of food/drinks and the portion size, it isn't worth the trek (speaking for my friend and I).",Penthouse 808
280,Eh. The dough tasted really fried and seemed nothing special. The special donuts are like $7The rainbow crumb cake was pretty tasty though - a little too much jelly on it. Very moist cake tho,"Wife, baby and I stopped here for breakfast and could not be more satisfied. We got the McGruffin with turkey bacon. Best breakfast in a long while!","Updating because after trying more things, the doughnuts and breakfast sandwiches have exceeded my expectations. It gets even better because they offer additional treats like Rainbow Cookie Crumb Cake, Rice Krispie Treats, insane cookies, and soft serve (stuffed in cookies too).","I need a few more visits of the same experience I had today. The short x6 person line made me feel important enough to be here. The glass display of all the donuts stirred the cream inside me. I couldn't wait to jump over the counter and take precise bites from everything. I'd even eat their counter type mood. I took the Horchata, Banana Choc, & a trippy French Cruller home to go... I'm now speechless on my green couch. I want to cry and thank my mother for never letting me get addicted to low quality sweets. $5 donuts = Wow in my mouth.Also. I purchased at 10am cause baked goods are true when freshly baked.","I'm so sad to have to rate an interesting donut place 1 star, but it has to be done.The biggest problem we had was with the Nutella Creme Brûlée donut. I'm all for novelty flavors, which is why I was initially excited about this place, but that specific donut tasted like cigarettes. Inexplicable, I know, but three people sharing this donut all got big mouthfuls of the cigarette taste. We didn't finish eating it.We also didn't finish our horchata donut. It seemed like the actual donuts themselves, without considering the toppings, are boring and a little dry. Imagine the texture of a day-old donut, and that's what we got here.Finally, the ordering system here seems like it needs work. We waited behind people who couldn't make up their minds about breakfast, and all I wanted was 2 donuts. Maybe a separate line for just donut orders could speed things along.Unfortunately, we don't go back again because we're all non-smokers, and the whole thing left a bad taste in our mouths.","Seeesh. Comfortland was more than comforting. It is filling to a T! The joint wasn't too packed on a Saturday AM, but the line was out the door afternoon 11AM. Highly recommend getting there earlier. Twas a great experience and one that will be relived later in life. What we snagged: -Creme Brûlée's doughnut that was CRAZY GOOD. THE Best in shoo. Highly recommend.    -low county friend chicken sandwich. Good, but TOO Fried. Chicken was dead. Slaw was flavorful, and sauce was succulent. They need to work on a more succulent piece of chicken. -Regular bacon egg and cheese. Very good. Best dish we had. The biscuit was fire. Overall, will be back for the regular egg sandwiches. However, until they get the chicken more pronounced, I won't dabble.",Comfortland
281,"Yesterday, I ordered some take out food from Ihawan Restaurant which took them more than an hour and a half to prepare.  I was so disappointed and will not go there anymore.  The lumpia Shanghai was soggy and burned, the crispy pata was so hard and burned too.  To top it all, the embutido was frozen and not even cooked.  I steamed the uncooked embutido and it wasn't even meat.  It looks like wood chips marinated with some weird spices. I end up throwing it out.","Food is always good but i believe its the skinny cashier sometimes a lilBit intimaditing and her tone of voice is a lil rude, if you wanna pay with two cards, minimum for one card is 10$ and for two cards its 20 per card, hahahahha i work in a restaurant and i find it confusing or they just dont want to pay extra in the bank i guess,",Ang lungkot ng pagkain dito.waited for like 40mins for our order pag dating ng pagkain namin minicrowave lang style nyo!,"I've had this place on my list for about 6 years, and I'm so glad I finally visited. The food and service were more than I could ever hope for. The service was one of the best I've ever experienced!The Platter for 2 ($34) was larger in person than in photos. It's very filling for two people. The Lumpiang Shanghai (spring rolls) were so delicious, my mouth is watering just thinking about them! The rest of the food was amazing as well.The Cantaloupe Juice ($3) tasted just like fresh cantaloupe. It was pretty sugary, but not enough to stop me from drinking all of it.The Halo-Halo ($5.50) was good, it was the perfect way to end the meal.Everything was so authentic. I've never been to the Philippines, but the atmosphere made me feel like I was transported to another country. My cousin ate Filipino food at her friend's house multiple times and said this was truly authentic. Her Filipino friend was actually the person who recommended this place.I wish Queens wasn't so far away from me, but maybe it's for the best because I would probably go here once a week.","Amazing Filipino food ! They are known for their bbq and skewers! So definitely come for those, not only do they have bbq but they have your typical Filipino food as well. Palabok pancit and sigsig. Definitely don't get shy when ordering a dish you have no idea about, I'm usually cautious but the food here is delicious ! Everything that comes out of that kitchen is just pure home-y Filipino cooking. I also heard that the avocado smash(?) or slushy was famous. They give you a purée avocado mixture with condensed and shaved ice. You mix the whole thing yourself which is kinda fun especially for kids. But the drink itself isn't too sweet but just enough to taste the avocado flavor and not overpowering it.","I've heard my Philippino best friend recommended this place to me for YEARS and with all the expectations built up, this place didn't disappoint me, yet amazed me with the passionate service, happy-n-chill vibe and authentic Philippine food - that is what dinner with your friends and family should be like, and this is definitely a great place for a delightful date (unless you don't want to chat with him/her, the music here is not as noisy as the ones in Manhattan, so...be prepared to talk LOL) With the platter combination, you get to taste different dishes on a huge leaf-covered plate. The taste is as good as the look of the Platter of 2, cute and vibrant, layers of flavors just popped in your mouth. I'm so glad we went with their recommendations! Guessing the ingredients can also be good conversational topics (date tip here, again!) Happiness in this restaurant is contagious. You can tell how happy everyone here is while enjoying the foods & drinks. The waiters here are by far the kindest ones I've encountered in New York, the experience is absolutely wonderful. Next time when you pass by this area, don't hesitate, walk straight from that normal entrance and head upstairs to enjoy this authentic Philippine culinary experience! Get the platter combination for your group, get some special drinks (you'll need them after having the flavorful foods).",Ihawan
282,The pork liver was raw!!!!! Terrible I will never eat or order from this disgusting place again!!!,Menu keeps on growing each time I come but somehow still maintains its home cooked feel.,"One star gives to food only, which its taste can be found in other Thai restaurant in Queens.It's NOT worth to try comparing with the bad manner of the waitresses. After we checked, we went to have dessert in another cafe shop nearby. After 30 min we stayed in the cafe, the waitress saw us and she came to complain us as we paid the low tip for them!! The funny thing was she remembered exact subtotal amount of food price we had and showed us calculation that we paid lower than 15% tip. (She calculated from grand total, not food price before tax, from which we normally calculated the tip.) She felt so upset and complained us in the cafe for almost 5 min. This manner totally ruined every normal to good thing about this restaurant.I believe that tip is a gratitude. It's NOT a requirement by law or necessary to pay if you don't appreciate. This waitress just provide lower to normal standard of service, e.g., not smile, monotone when she talked to customers, not ask us anything after all food is served. Nothing is impressive on their service. How could she expect us to give her 18% tip? This restaurant received cash only. No credit card fee the restaurant must subsidize. Due to this bad manner, we ensure that we will NOT come back this restaurant again. Additionally, I will NOT recommend this restaurant to my friends or others.","Located on the ground floor of a residential apartment complex, it feels like you're eating in a Thai family's home. Upon opening the door to the restaurant, you're instantly greeted with the aroma of fish sauce that permeates the vicinity. That's how I knew this place was a winner. We had:Esan sausage (perfectly sour and savory)Crab omelette (it wasn't bad but not a complete standout like the other dishes)Pork Larb (which also had pork liver, pork stomach, ground pork, and also pork ear. The texture and flavor combination was out of this world. We ordered ""spicy"" which was 10 chilies; which wasn't the most spicy level; but it was HOTTTTT)Pork pad krapow (also pretty damn spicy but in a good, masochistic way)Looking forward to my next visit! Wonder if I can handle the Thai spicy (15 chilies!)","After reading all the rave reviews that have been hitting the press in recent months, and discovering they deliver to my apt, I knew it had to try Hug Esan.Unfortunately, I came away underwhelmed. Was really excited about the pork larb but it ended up not being to my taste, prefer the juicier version from SriPraPhai. Grilled chicken was also only ok - thought some parts of it were a bit dry. Papaya salad I ordered the Laos version and it ended up being too funky for me - probs should have stuck to the Thai version. To my surprise, the Pad Ka Prow (chicken) was unexpectedly delicious and my favorite dish. Coconut pudding was surprisingly dense but a good flavor. I really wanted to like this more than I did - perhaps I need to visit in person and try the popular fish dishes / crab omelette.","I came here for lunch with a friend. I had the curry noodles lunch special which came out to $11 and my friend had the fried fish lunch special, the one that's been very popular amongst their customers and is about $13. The lunch special comes with soup and spring rolls. The soup had an unexpected flavor. It was sour and sweet, and refreshing. Overall, it was an okay meal. I would like to go back and try other dishes from their menu. I think I can find something that I like even more. The service was really good. The restaurant closed for an hour, for the employees to take a break. My friend and I were still in the restaurant, almost done eating, when we realized it was their break hour, so we left, but they were very nice about it. They didn't even mention anything about it and didn't rush us at all.I ordered their papaya salad to-go once and I really liked that dish. It was crunchy, tangy, and light but still satisfied me.",Hug Esan
283,"DISCLAIMER: this is a service reviewOnce upon a time not too long ago (2015), my view on desserts was a donut from D&D and some gummy bears. After experiencing places like Spot Dessert and Prince Tea House, my tooth had converted from savory to sweet.I first experience at Prince Tea House was in Sunset Park. I remembered feeling as if I was waiting for Queen Elizabeth to appear from the back. The decor is very elegant with Lenox style dinnerware and an extensive drink and dessert menu. I remembered the service was attentive and the food/drink met my expectations. So when I visited the Flushing and Astoria location, I wondered if it would meet my expectations from the first visit. For me, the service and food was very similar at all of those locations. In this case, having the consistency at all the locations was a huge plus. This location may be the closest late night (open until midnight) dessert spot in the area that is reachable by subway. This particular time, after hours of fighting the urge, we arrived at 11:40pm. Needless to say, we were the last ones there and still the service was very attentive and did not rush us at all. We ordered the potted caramel tea and the coconut panna cotta, which came out with the same look feel and taste as always. We did end up leaving a few minutes before midnight (fast eating), and they did close the doors right afterwards. Just the fact that they served us and didn't give us any grief or emit negative energy, I keep this place as a must visit for all you dessert fans.",This place harrased my friend for a tip on our way out. The order total was $26 and change I made the total even $30 this is more than 10% tip. Now i see that i was charged $31 and change which is one of the suggested tip (18%). They charged my card an amount i didnt authorize which make them unethical business! I always came here and never had this issue before. I am not sure if its the recent waiter or the managment changed! This is not okay! It's only a dollar change but charging my card more than I authorized is NOT Okay! Their AC was broken and we sucked it up in this heat and we didn't complain but to go this far is not right! I am very upset at this; first harrasing my friend for a tip when we added tip and now charging my card more than we authorized!! Be aware!,The desserts aren't very good. Maybe the tea is better? I was surprised considering the menu items weren't cheap and the place had really good yelp reviews. The waffle was soggy. I also tried the trio sampler and the fruit tart + raspberry creme brulee were so sad. They were so small but I couldn't even finish it because the crust + brulee tasted stale / artificial.,I love Prince Tea House! I usually go to their Flushing location but tried out this location a few months ago.I got the Honey Toast and Green Tea crepe cake - both amazing! The green tea crepe cake had the perfect amount of cream.  I got the cold rose milk tea - my favorite! I usually get 30% sugar but it still tastes pretty sweet to me.The decor is really cute and atmosphere is great. Highly recommend.,"Had a pretty bad experience. Waited to be seated which is fine, but we were still waiting 15 minutes after several tables were cleared. We knew this because we were standing in the doorway watching people leave. But no one bothered to call us over.Once seated, it took a while for someone to come take out order. The food came pretty quick, which was great. We had ordered some wine as well but it never came. We only saw the waitress twice throughout this whole experience. Once, when she took our order. The second time was when we had to flag her down for the check. We practically had to beg. We had thought that she'd at least eventually come check up on us. When she never came, we even stacked the empty plates and cups in the middle as a cue. She was helping the tables beside us but didn't bother to turn her head and ask us if everything was fine? At that point the place was mostly cleared out so we figured we'd at least get OK service. That was too much to ask for.Anyway, we had to tell her that we never got our wine and that we'd like it stricken from the check. Unfortunately this kind of turned us off this location, as we had been here once before and really liked it. Oh well, all in all it was one of those things we kept laughing about throughout the night because of how bad it was. Silver linings, I suppose.","This was a cute little cafe. that is so pretty when you enter. The ambiance was very fresh and clean. There were plants everywhere, in cute matching pots. There were plants on almost every wall. The colors of the cafe were light and classy. The presentations of the desserts were nice. I usually like only sugary and sticky desserts, and their variety were not from my usual picks. However, I tried all the desserts my friends ordered, and I liked all of them. They were not to sweet, but they were rich in flavor. Their presentation was also very attractive to the eye. The waitress was very sweet, answering all our questions and always following up with us, making sure we are all satisfied with our food and service. I would definitely recommend, if you are looking for something sweet while in the area.",Prince Tea House
284,"The CBGB and Grilled Cheese Waffle w/ buttermilk chicken are absolutely phenomenal! If you haven't tried these two, you're missing out!",Try out kotosouvli & buffalo calamari for dinner you will be licking your fingers!!!a+++ experience,The food was mediocre and and on the pricier side. The waiting time to get the food was ridiculous.That's all.,"Actually 3.5 stars.Tasteful contemporary decor coupled with a nice ambiance. A good place for a social dinner since the music is not loud. Seating is also generously spaced apart.  The food here ranged from good to mediocre, but nothing mind blowing.  Completely acceptable if it was half the price. BTW, this should be listed as a $$$ restaurant instead of $$.The best dish was the Monastiraki bifteki. Naturally delicious meat texture, without being mushy or with cheese added. IMHO perfectly seasoned.The grilled octopus appetizer was seasonally priced, whereas every other Greek restaurant I've been to in Queens charges a fixed $17 to $19 for a comparable serving size. Of course when the bill came, it was $28 for the standard 2 tentacles. It did taste good though.Lamb chop special of the day a shocking $42!The Garidopilafo curried shrimp sounded amazing but tasted uninspiring, partly because the rice was tastier than the shrimp. On the other hand, the Greek coffee skirt steak and accompanying mashed potatoes was too salty. This inconsistency is just sloppy for a restaurant that aspires to be higher end.Service was efficient and friendly, and we still had a good time, so no regrets going there.","Inviting and comfortable.Good food. Great service.I really liked my experience, as did my friends.","Had a delicious family brunch here. I don't venture to Astoria often and happen to be there visiting family friends and found this place via hand-dandy Yelp! It was a great find. I had their Coffe-Steak & Eggs, which I was hesitant to try but it was SO good! If I am ever in the area, I would visit this place again or reccomend it to friends.",Ovelia
285,"Don't come to this restaurant. Should really call on the health department to this establishment. I was so excited to come here after a friend told me they do $27 per person all you can eat. We came on a Friday night, waited 58 minutes to be exact, of course they told us we will wait 30 mins, it was around 8pm so we expected to wait. Now food, is really bad. First of all they have more pork options than meat... the brisket beef is the only one that's acceptable, we also got bulgogi and steak. The bulgogi I had SO much fat in it! They only give you the bad portions. The steak tasted a little like iron and liver! really cheap and nasty taste. I'm a fan of steak and I always get it, and this one has a terrible taste!!! They only give you two side dishes that are the less common and less tasty. We had to tell them to refill our bottle of water after they took the empty one...the other options you got to order like stew paste soup and rice... they don't even fill it all the way up.... THEY DONT CHANGE THE GRILL, so all the beef and pork gets cross contaminated and that's really bad. CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS THE WORST!!!!They were NOT friendly at all, you want to ask them a question about the beef? Better not, they won't even give you an answer just keep quiet. My boyfriend asked the chubby waiter (that waits at the door and calls your name if your next) that we had another order of brisket beef coming, and if he could just check if it's on the way (because we were done with what we had on the grill and waiting for the next order) and the guy just looked at my boyfriend and walked away like ""fine I'll check"" he didn't even say anything! And he has a nasty attitude. When we left, the same waiter was picking up the check, we stood up said thank you and he didn't even say anything.... they don't even greet you when you come in or say goodbye. Other Korean places do it because it's good manners but they all got bad attitude. Don't come to this restaurant.","Accommodated our group of 8 gracefully on a weekdays afternoon. The lunch selection options were a bit more limited compared to the dinner, nonetheless, delicious! They cut the meat for you (a big plus for me) and had excellent side sauces. Ambience isn't as nice as other AYCE KBBQs, but it did the trick.","BAD AND DISHONEST BUSINESS PRACTICE. THEY ARE OUT TO CHEAT YOU IF YOU ARE NOT AWAREMy son went to O2 with a few friends, a party of 4 but a youthful group. When they received the check a 20% gratuity was added on the check. All the other receipts posted by others on yelp do not show this charge. It also does not specify on their menu that there was such a charge, even for larger groups. AND this is not a Jean George or Nobu, they should not be charging any automatic tip of 20%, or in this case even more.Firstly, if they even specified that they would charge the gratuity, it should not be 20% on the total, including taxes. Tip is correctly calculated on only what is ordered and should exclude the tax, as no service was provided for the tax. Secondly, this establishment has discriminated against a group of young people, as I could only concluded that they felt it was alright to assume that 'these kids' will not pay any gratuity, so then it would be acceptable to CHEAT them of additional money by adding on a gratuity charge that is too high. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND CLEARLY WRONGThere are plenty of other places with great Korean BBQ there is no need to support a place that is dishonest.","See if you can find parking in the shopping lot right across the street or you will most likely have to find parking in the neighborhood. As a group of 5 friends we had about a 30-40 minute wait around 8pm, so get ready to grab a seat in the lobby or hang out outside. If you do hang outside they will go outside and call your name when you're up.This is my second time here so I had a more focused choice, beef brisket and bulgogi were our favorites, maybe a little basic but I think these are great. You have about a little over an hour to eat as much as you can! Continually order after every completion. You can order the grape soju, my friends love it.The servers were great, funny and accommodating, we had John, a cool dude. Ask them to teach you how to play the cap game with the metal cap of a soju bottle.","Similar price range as Cast Iron nearby, and I love O2 too. I really appreciated the ventilation and how spacious the seating was compared to other korean BBQ places I've been to. Naturally you're still going to come out smelling like KBBQ smoke but the air is far less dense in O2 than at other places I've tried. This is a huge plus IMO because if you're going to an AYCE KBBQ place, you're probably already going to have difficulty breathing if you're doing it right. The ventilation and space in O2 makes your life markedly easier.Service was excellent. Easily the best service I've had at a KBBQ place. The server was extremely friendly, prompt, responsive, and made good recommendations for which cuts to try and ways to dress each cut (sauces, radish, etc). She was also a very clear communicator, which is kind of a rarity.The meats however, didn't feel as good as Cast Iron or non-AYCE places. They're still decent to above-average, and the marinade is right, but the mouthfeel for the top blade/kalbi had less 'bite.' Could just be this one time -- I'm definitely coming back to try it again.So one corollary to the excellent service was that they brought out everything extremely quickly. Once the cooked meats were 60% eaten, the new batch of meat was brought out. Which meant that we were stuffing ourselves at a rapid pace. We ordered 5 different things from the jump, and we were already finished with those 5 orders within 30 minutes. I'd recommend pacing yourself to maximize the experience and food. That would also mitigate cross-contamination from the raw meat which drips to the cooked meats which are 'lower' on the pot. A way to avoid this would be to collect all of the cooked meats onto your bowl, but I personally prefer keeping the meat warmer. To be clear, that's not a mark against O2 -- just something to keep in mind when you enjoy yourself here.","My boyfriend and I decided to try out Korean BBQ for the first time and we chose this location because of the amazing reviews. We arrived around 8pm and waited for about 15 minutes before we were seated. The set up was very nice at the table,however since this was our first time, we were not familiar with the sauces or different types of side dishes. When the waiter did come over, he asked us if we were ready to order and I did ask him to explain how the ordering works. He did explain, however it was busy so it felt rushed. We ordered multiple meats and my favorite was the spicy chicken. The food was amazing and the all you can eat made it even better ! 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish they explained the set up, sauces and ordering set up, but we will def be returning !",O2 Korean BBQ
286,I bought Jolly Hotdog for take out and when I got home i saw 2 dead fucking cockroach I called them to repot this issue then they told me to send the picture to their email and I did they said they gonna call me back after that I never heard from them they didn't call me back they didn't do nothing to fix this issue !! This place is terrible!!!!!!!! Dirty as hell!!!,"We usually order certain dishes only. The palabok and spaghetti don't have enough sauce.  We buy Family Pack, sadly it taste dry.  We tried to call to complain but no reply.  We even end up adding more spaghetti sauce that we made.   If we are going to make our own sauce, what's the point if buying it from Jollibee!   And it's expensive too!","To be fair, this review is for their fried chicken only.  I've never had any of their other offerings, besides their peach pie (which was good).  I was in the neighborhood, and walking by Jollibee, so decided to get a bucket of chicken to go.  The bucket only consisted of 6 pieces (3 drumsticks and 3 thighs) and a container of gravy, for $9.99.  People on Yelp rave about this chicken but I thought it was just ok.  Nothing special.  It wasn't spicy at all and the gravy was...just gravy (not bad but not that good either).  I'm glad I tried it and satisfied my curiosity, but I wouldn't order it again.  Maybe I'll return to try their other items.","Friends were raving about it, so SO and I decided to try it out. First time we went to the Manhattan one, and we came to this location twice. This location is significantly better (and cheaper too).First time here I got pineapple juice and a big box of spaghetti to go. Pineapple juice tastes real (and it's pretty cheap), and the spaghetti is somewhat sweeter than what you'd expect. Can't stop eating it though! Second time, we got a chicken joy 2pc meal with pineapple juice, spaghetti, and the mango peach pie. The pie is warm, perfect amount of sweetness, and just so rich in flavor. Spaghetti and pineapple juice I still have the same opinion as before. Chicken joy at this location is definitely better than what I had at the Manhattan one, juicer. However, not the best fried chicken out there (skin isn't super good), but definitely above average. Lots of people here - be prepared to wait! Food is prepared very fast, and definitely come if you want some decent fast food with a new twist!","Really great food here and such fast service. Finding parking can be a challenge, but its worth it. My favorite thing from here is the peach mango pie. Without holes in the box, the pie remained perfectly crispy on the outside and super hot on the inside. If there's only one thing you try from Jolibee, TRY THEIR PIE. I ate two of these before having the meal. Trust me, you won't regret doing it.Their ""ChickenJoy"" (fried chicken) with gravy is very good. Its very juicy. Definitely better than your local KFC. Their 'fiesta noodles'/ pancit palabok was SO flavorful. It comes with noodles, meat, a boiled egg, shrimp, scallion and a shrimp sauce. Its so easy to eat a whole box of this. The crunchyy chicharron pieces on top really add a nice funky crunchy to the dish. I could eat these all day. With the meal, you get to choose a drink. Their pineapple juice is very refreshing. We downed the pies in the car before even leaving. There are some tables in the store, but they were pretty crowded even after normal dinner time.","As a lover of all chicken fried, I've long awaited trying Jollibee. When it comes to fast food fried chicken, I'm a Popeyes over KFC fan. I'm looking for juicy, meaty chicken, with a crispy, flavorful skin. We got a family meal of 6 pieces, mashed potatoes with gravy, fries, and the pancit noodles. It also came with 3 mango pies. Also got a Halo haloThe pros: I am a typical Asian and only like dark meat which is what they serve here. The skin is crispy and not too oily or heavy. You can't go wrong with gravy. The fries were decent.The servers are super friendly and happy to answer any questions. The mango pie was a nice change from your McD's apple pies.The cons: The chicken itself did not live up to Popeyes. It wasn't as juicy and the skin wasn't as flavorful. The sides were very mediocre. Nothing I'd crave. The prices were much higher than other chains. The restaurant was super overcrowded and hard to get to seat. Overall, too expensive for what you get. Popeyes ftw!",Jollibee
287,East Ocean palace is our family's favorite dim sum place in Queens. It is always crowd in the weekend but the wait isn't bad. They serve decent dim sum with high quality and reasonable price. Our only complaint is sometimes you need to *fight* with other people to get limited dim sum.,"It's been a while since I've last wrote my review. In the last two visits, they haven't been great. Once it was extremely crowded, given it's the only dim sum spot in the area, so instead of waiting, we did take out. The prices must increased because WOW this spot got pricey. Damn near $50 for a small handful of dishes. Taste is just okay. Another time we arrive at 9-9:30AM and there was only two people dining in the restaurant. Came in with a double tandem stroller that's easily collapsible. They asked us to leave the stroller by the entrance. Since it was empty, we asked if we could close it up by the table (that way its not in the way of the carts but still have our stuff nearby) but they said no. It's EMPTY so we decided to leave. Didn't feel welcome or family friendly. So disappointing because we did like this spot. Oh well.","Best Chinese restaurant in Forest Hills and environs. No other, old or new, comes close.","Food was good but not great. We came for dinner so the crowd was not there unlike what happens in the morning. I felt the food was a bit overpriced for Chinese food and didn't have the quality it should. NO dim sum after 2:30.We ordered the half oven chicken which was tasty and the house special fried rice which wasn't good at all. Idk if that's how it should be but I don't like fish in my fried rice,  especially that smelly fish. A bit discouraging to eat and the portion was large enough for 2 people. We also got the sea bass with vegetables (Broccoli and mushrooms with congee soup (on the side)). He fish was good, the flavors were there; Garlicky and buttery. Their jasmine tea kept coming and that was the best thing I would say. I have to make a point to check them out for lunch to try some dim sum. Our order total was $80. Excluding tips.","So so dim sum experience on a Saturday.  We did not have to wait more than 10 minutes for a table for 3 because of the many smaller tables in the middle of the dining room.  The larger groups of 8+ had much longer waits though.  Upon seating and getting our teapot (chrysanthemum), the carts started rolling to our table, with the dim sum ladies giving a rundown of what they were serving.  East Ocean is not as big as some of the other Flushing Cha Laus, so doesn't offer as many special items nor cooked to order dishes.  You can still special order noodle and rice dishes to supplement the dim sum carts.All our usual dishes were available, though not all at once and had to wait for a couple of rounds to get certain dishes.  Har Gow, Shui Mai, Ngau Cheung, Har Cheung were all good, as expected.  A couple of dishes such as the Pork Riblet Mini Claypot Rice was unusual, cute and tasty.  In addition, we ordered a large plate of Crabmeat Yee Mein with good flavor, but was not worth the $17.95 price because that wasn't real crabmeat in it and what was there wasn't very much (not exactly sure what kind of crustacean it was or maybe man-made?)  The highlight though was the may toy (dessert).  The egg tarts were crispy and the Malaysian steamed cake rolls were fresh, sweet and spongy.When the bill came (mai dahn), I was shocked!  $92 for 3 people is pretty steep for dim sum and that was before gratuity!  Granted, we ate a lot, but not nearly as much as what 4 of us normally have at Good Fortune and they already include gratuity.  Plus you have to pay $2.50 for parking on Queens Blvd.  So long Forest Hills, I'm going back to Flushing.","Hello and welcome to another angry rant on Yelp! I'll start with the good, which is the food. I've been here several times and the food is great, no complaints there (spoiler alert - its the service that is lacking)The restaurant is mostly full, I come in and grab a number and wait. I notice there's an empty table which is odd but sure, whatever I can wait a few minutes... until another family comes in and takes it! They ask for a number, just like us and they are directed straight to the table. I ask the hostess what's the deal and she rolls her eyes and says - they have 10 people, she then turns her back and walks away. Pretty frustrated at that I grab the manager, who is already giving me a look. I ask him the same and he doesn't bother explaining anything, just ' That's our policy, if you don't like it..."" Great! It turns out I don't like it, I'll go somewhere else to eat. I read some of the other reviews and yup not like I was singled out but they do this to a lot of people, but man what a hit or miss spot. Next time I want some dim sum I'll for sure suck it up and just drive into Flushing. 24 hrs late and I'm still seething!",East Ocean Palace
288,"Thought I was getting a poke bowl, but there was literally no salmon pieces in it. There was some kind of blended up mush that might have been salmon? But who knows. Eel is also not fresh. Definitely the canned stuff from the market. Most disappointing rice bowl I've ever had.","PSA:I love this place and it's the only place I go for ""poke"" but it's just not as good anymore. It's now $1 extra for avocado, other toppings are still available but there are a few missing, mango disappeared, I don't know what else. Of the proteins it's $1 for shrimp, and $1 for eel. the fish may not be as fresh anymore since my cats smelled it but wouldn't eat it, usually they're all over good fish. Base bowl price is $11.95, but the bowls are smaller than before. :(",Great food but customer service terrible!!!yesterday was the third time I went there around 9:30pm and they said it is too late and are closing now. No more food and all chairs on tables. So why open hours are 11:30-10:00 pm ??? Change it to 9:30pm if at 9:30 there is no chance even for order to go.,"So, I'm new to the whole poke bowl world. I've been wanting to try it but I'm very weird about my fish. I love sushi but I hate cooked fish so I was nervous to try poke. I decided to try Kissfish mostly based on proximity. After my first bite I was hooked. Their bowls are always fresh and delicious. Everyone that works there is super nice. They have a loyalty program which is amazing!! A lot of places don't offer that anymore and it's so great that they do. Definitely check them out.","I've gotten poke bowls from here a few times (to go) and it's so good and filling.. they could put some more fish/protein in, kinda stingy/cheap on it but still so filling because of the rice.  It's a small place..there are a few tables to sit on the inside of the restaurant if needed but it's always hot and awkwardly silent in there and kinda lackluster inside, so I'd rather take it to go..Usually my fave is the salmon, tofu and when I'm in the right mood, spicy tuna (can be a lil fishy).. ask for all the (free) toppings and you've got an entire meal... would come back here again! Location is very convenient, right off the Forest Hills stop..Also, they have a rewards system, if you make a certain amount of purchases (8 or 9) you get a free bowl/wrap/or 3 combo handroll!","My bf and I would go to this place a lot, esp after the gym etc. I use to really like this place for their food, and service. Not sure what happened but it started going downhill. So let me talk about the food first. It's pretty average for a pokebowl place. I prefer the rolls more since the bowl doesn't have as many toppings as other poke places. They also started charging more for avocado, which is fine and understandable. Their station use to be really clean, where the guys would wipe it down very often. Today, on a monday, during lunch, it looked like a mess and not everything was prepped yet. Not to mention they didn't have some items such as nori and shrimp? it's a freaken Monday and you're operating a restaurant with minimal ingredients for crying out loud. Okay, so lets get into the service. My usual encounters were with the guys that worked there. They were great, nice, and have a happy face and greeted you well. They def made the ordering process fun and enjoyable. They made THIS place seem like a fun enjoyable place to chill and get food from. So the question is, where are these great guys??? Today I was greeted by a pretty rude condescending female. Lets just say, this girl was the worse. If you had a happy morning, she'll bring you down with her. She was so rude and moody like as if the world owed her something. Before, the ordering process was you just pick what you want in your bowl, as they put it in, which was what I was use to. I guess now, you just have to tell them every ingredient you want and pay first. She didn't bother to tell me of course, instead she just stood there rolling her eyes silently.. which was awesome. Got my mood going. Then, I forgot what some of the ingredients were, so I asked to clarify, and she would do an undertone sigh and aggressively tell me what it'd be. It's like dude, if you hate your job esp in customer service, just quit. nobody is holding a gun to your head to make you do this. I don't understand this hostile attitude. As we left, my bf told me, he should have warned me beforehand. He mentioned whenever he went, there'd be 2 girls who would have this awful attitude. The guys are great and nice, but the girls are horrible with customer service. Anyways Kissfish, if you want to maintain better service, I'd advise you to retrain some of your employees. This def put a sour taste to my experience so not sure if I'd wanna come back. I don't think anyone wants to go to a place where they're paying to just get a quick bite, and end up leaving feeling disrespected and irritated. You guys have been warned. Put on thick skin if you're being greeted by the females there.",Kissfish
289,"I am amazed this place stays in business.  Service here leaves a lot to be desired. Our server was very nice and sweet. Though she never checked back on us and kept us waiting to order. But the entire restaurant runs around as if their heads are chopped off. It's utter chaos, and not in a good way.  Coming here always seems like a good idea until we actually do. Then I always regret it.","Created my own burger to go, having a bison patty along with turkey bacon and aged cheddar, among other elements.  Was a tad pricey but meat was moist and was quite filling.","A would call this a hipster burger place. But these hipsters know how to make a good burger. They have a veggie burger called the ""Impossible Burger"" but if I wanted veggies I'd order French fries or onion rings.

290,"This is a well-decorated restaurant across the street from LaGuardia Community College. The food has gone downhill since the restaurant opened, a victim of its own success--it is so busy now large groups may have to wait for a table. Still, it is tasty enough, and the strong spice in almost every dish makes up for any shortcoming. It is more expensive than many other eateries in the neighborhood, but still affordable.If you can't stand spice or dairy, though, then you may want to try another restaurant.","Underwhelmed. It was the greatest canteen style Indian restaurant, they are missing the mark. I'm Indian so I know by default they are missing the mark. I didn't understand the hype. The baby tandoori chicken was alright. Marinate didn't go all the way through inside the chicken, it's a baby chicken pretty easy to marinate not sure what went missing there. The naan was good. Only the butter naan was good.Cheese naan was not good. It was soggy and chewy. Butter chicken was extremely watery.It needed to be boiled more or needed to have less water! Disappointing. Appetizer was okay for a $6 dahi batata puri I expected more. There should have been atleast 5/6 of those. The price for that is steep. Overall not impressed and another unpleasant thing was every 5-10 minutes of the 1:30 hour (including the wait time for food) we stayed there, we were being asked and eventually bothered by servers asking ""if we are okay"".... it created a bit of an issue for us since we were being interrupted for no reason literally every 10 minutes.... when we asked one of the 4 servers why they were only asking our table so frequently, there answer was ""we have reservation for 10 ppl next"" okay and that's our problem .... why? Not coming back.","Totally underwhelmed. Went there based on all the great reviews, expecting much better than what we got. I would suggest not to get the saag paneer. It was extremely bitter and had no gravy whatsoever. And expensive for what it is. The dhai puri was okay but they only give you four small puris. The famous biryani bowl is expensive for what it is and it's  serving size. Don't think I'd ever go back.",ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE! The staff are great and very personable. The food is incredible and love that they have local LIC beer too.Goat biryani and garlic naan were delicious. Start with the dahi batata puri. It's a cold appetizer that ends in a little spice.The whole wait staff sang Happy Birthday to my friend along with bringing out rice pudding dessert with a candle. It was super cute.,"My friend recommended this place and I loved it! The interior decorations and music give it a cozy vibe. We got puri, which is my favorite. I was first time trying that and the juice was just exploding in my mouth. Really interesting. Goat biryani is flavorful too! I like how it comes with a giant pot and you had to open the outside dough. Please also try their garlic nann! It is so garlicky buttery thin and crispy. This is definitely the best nann I have ever got. Finish them when you are there otherwise they get soggy. One star off for their paneer and khurchan. It is so salty that I believed they added salt accidentally. My friend has been to this place for many times. Even she said the paneer and khurchan is not good.","Adda is fantastic dinner option in LIC! I came here with 2 of my girl friends who knew exactly what to order. This place is also Halal which was great for one of my friends. We came during Ramadan so we actually had to wait a little before sunset/were able to eat. Luckily the staff here was extremely accommodating and understanding. We placed our order ahead of time, and they waited to cook/serve our food at the appropriate time.For appetizers we split the Kale Pakoda. And for entrees, we did family-style and ordered the Lamb Chops, Butter Chicken, Chicken Biryani, and Saag Paneer. Normally I don't go crazy for Lamb Chops (or lamb in general as depending on how its cooked, has a slight aftertaste) but the lamb chops here are amazing! They were seasoned and cooked perfectly. We also got a side of the cheese naan that was spicy (but soo good). Most of the dishes ended up being pretty spicy (which is expected), but everything was so tasty. My two recommendations are definitely the cheese naan and the lamb chops. My other two friends absolutely loved the Kale Pakoda - it was really good, but I wasn't crazy over it. Adda definitely has something right going on for them: their food is extremely tasty and fresh. Will be coming back for sure!Also, don't forget to check-in on Yelp for a free cup of Chai at the end of your meal. Beware it is not sweet, and you likely will have to add some sugar. Best way to enter a food coma!",Adda
291,"When I first came here the reviews were a lot higher. I see they've fallen off and I can tell the food and service have gone down even lower. Firstly, so many rave reviews about the mac and cheese so I knew I had to have it! Made an order to go and by the time I got home, I was saddened to see hard cubes of painstakingly yellow cheese still mixed in with seemingly ""hot"" food. (In my Killmonger voice) ""is this y'all spot?"". I tf not! There's something super gutterbutt about using ""government cheese"" in a soul food restaurant. Also it had no taste! Secondly, nor did the fried fish I ordered. To top it off, the service was incredibly slow as the young lady serving us was more into sweet talking the male clientele (insert eye roll here). Once again I'm sorely disappointed in what Richmond Hill calls ""good food"". I beg you all to broaden your horizons and venture out of this hellish wormhole and experience food of quality!","First started coming here a year ago and it was great. Then past couple of months they were inconsistent and not the best but we didn't give up in hopes that they will get it back together. Then tonight we received ROTTEN FOOD. The crab legs were dark, not dark spots, the entire leg was dark. Then some had dark bumps on it. It was terrible. We didn't even want to touch it. So sad because we want to support the small neighborhood business but we can't keep wasting time and money.","I came here yesterday for my friends bday brunch. I got one plate of food and unlimited ""mimosa"" but it was served with fruit punch ( that to me was different, not in a good way) However the music was great, variety of tunes. The upstairs part was for private parties, it was a big space but can be renovated. The food was served on white foam paper plate (very cheapy) they also had Hookah if you wanted to purchase separately. The food was good so this is why I'm back. There's a restaurant on the side and I was craving the grits and since I didn't get any shrimp I figured I'd try that today. I also am trying their quesadillas! I've heard good things about that food and since yesterday I had a good experience I figured I should try their restaurant as well.","Good neighborhood bar. Great tasting food friendly staff and good signature drinks. Bar has TVs and tables, separate side for dining. Open late during the week. Reasonable prices for food. 10-30 dollars, variety of food dishes.","Let me start off by saying Vibes is ALWAYS a vibe. I just absolutely love this place for brunch! They have brunch only on Sundays for $35(+tax) per person with bottomless mimosas as you dine. Their mimosas by the way are delicious and can creep up on you. I always order the crab legs for brunch they are a bit small but still always seasoned well with old bay and garlic butter. I highly recommend the Mac and cheese, the salmon cakes, and spinach. All very good side dishes. I've come here before and others have had the chicken wings and said it was really good as well. My friend had the chicken and red velvet waffle and said it was really really good. That food just touches your soul if you haven't been, I suggest you go, you won't be disappointed.","I came here yesterday for my friends bday brunch.

292,Ordered food from here. The food came promptly but 2/4 dishes we ordered were inedible- so salty we literally threw them out. One was the Al Pastor taco and the other was an appetizer with spicy sausage...really disappointed considering the reviews. Never again.,They delivered the wrong order just now. And there's no way to speak to the restaurant.  Their telephone # doesn't pick up -- and won't allow me to leave a message. Done. Not ordering from them again.,"Came here to celebrate my dad's birthday and the service and food was delicious. The drinks are bit expensive and not that great. They charge you extra for an extra empty wraps for your food. Anyway, we had a great time and the food definitely made up for the drinks.","Great food! I ordered fish tacos to go. Definitely, I'll come back. There are many Mexican places but I think this place is the best. Server was nice too.",I want to love this place but I can't I end up here because one of my friends loves this place if not I wouldn't come. I think it's overrated and expensive for what they offer as food and service. The sacrifice I make for my friends.‍,"This place rules. It wasn't too busy on a Friday evening and we got delicious, fresh guac made right in front of us! The service was on point, I think the manager took our order?? - always nice to see a crew that pitches in - and our drinks came out pretty fast. They make a solid margarita, and had fun Spanish music playing the whole time. I loved the atmosphere AND the service and can't wait to go back since there's still quite a few things on the menu I really wanted to try!",Chihuahua
293,"I come here for the best Grandma slice in Queens.I couldn't post this review because it was too short but it feels embarrassing to write about the savory tomato sauce infused with herbs and topped with a slight sprinkling of cheese. At every bite, your teeth sinks into the fluffiest dough and then through the crunchy bottom. Your fingers as you try to hold onto the hot spice and avoid the sauce. Finish it down with some soda because I'm here for a good time and don't need no sermon about how bad soda is for ya ok? Life is hard enough, eat at Louie's and give your actual grandma a call while you're at it.","Awesome pizza joint in Elmhurst.I can only vouch for the pizza as I got a pie from here once and I had no complaints about the food. The only thing that I found annoying was that they charge you tax if you use a card and no tax with cash. I realized that after I handed over my card and forgot I had enough cash. Nevertheless, I will be back and pay cash next time!!",Elmhurst needed a pizzeria like this.  Chicken Parmigiana sandwich is banging. Pastas are solid.Solid pizza and Sicilians.  Pepperoni rolls are legit.  Garlic knots on point.,"My wife and I arrived on a flight at LGA with an international flight scheduled at JFK later in the day.  We used the extended layover to try Louie's since it was a quick Uber ride from LGA.  It was the best pizza decision we have ever made!Louie was incredibly kind and welcoming despite being so busy.  He offered us a place to stash our luggage, asked where we were from, and made sure we were taken care for our entire visit.  The Grandma pie was amazing, but so was the other pizza we tried.  You know you are in the right place when locals are consistently lined up or calling to order.Now we are planning our next visit to try the pasta and ribeye that Pops is in charge of making.  The only thing that would make it better... Louie and Pops deciding to open the same restaurant in Texas!Thank you Louie!","Chicken Alfredo pasta . Good portion . Nice seating . Nice people. Fast service. Very bland . Overrated .Not seasoned at all . Tasted like milk , pasta & chicken. I seasoned it myself with the dry pizza seasonings . It needed more flavor .","Excellent grandma slice but I come here for the pasta first and foremost.  The chicken parm with pasta plate is fantastic.  Usually the pasta that comes along with chicken parm dishes at a lot of places are bland and kind of an afterthought.  Here, the pasta is well seasoned and tasty.Agnolotti-so good.  Just order it.Side note, I always call ahead and every time I walk in, the young owner (Louie?) greets me ""your food is ready, guy"" without me saying a word.",Louie's Pizza
294,I've been here in the past and just recently went with my husband over the weekend and I must say I was very disappointed. I've had their grilled octopus and it's definitely not the same as it was 1 years ago,"I was in this restaurant on a weekend. There was a middle aged woman in the front desk, she was so rude. She seats customers at her whim. We were so upset we have to leave. She did not even apologize when she gave two tables to two groups of customers who were there after us.","I have NO IDEA how this eatery get the 4 stars!? Its a mystery to me ! They might BRIBED  people for the good Reviews! I've been living in Cyprus on Greek part of the Island for two years and experienced the best of the Greek cuisine but what I have been served in that place was absolutely unexpected and WAS EXTREMELY BAD TASTE! - pork souvlaki was so tough and chewy even my dog refused to eat it - bunch of cold appetizers were even worse!"" tarama "" was passed the EXPARATION DATE maybe since Greece Independence year ! "" tzatziki "" had so much garlic - I can kill Count Dracula in one breath if I would be eating it and some kind of cold mashed potato from powder of "" Uncle Ben's "" package I guess ,was horrible how it's sound ! When I tried to ask my money back (it  was delivered)  I was denied of this option by very angry owner with ugly attitude and NO  professional manners, she threw the food I brought back out of the door and asked me to leave !!  To keep my $24 obviously was more important for her than good reputation of that place!","Went here for the first time last night and I have to say our meal was the best Greek food I've eaten. Although not pretentious, the food as super fresh and you could tell they took pride in what they served, with prices that were very reasonable.The service was excellent, especially the hostess/manager (maybe), who graciously welcome us upon our arrival and genuinely thanked us on the way out as we told her how amazing our meal was. You could tell that she really cared about her restaurant, as if she had invited us into her home to eat.Our party of three ordered the saganaki, skordilia and grilled octopus apps. The saganaki was amazingly cheesy, the skodilia creamy and the octopus perfectly cooked - you could tell how fresh it was.My two companions has pastichio, which was a serving size for two and excellent. I had the grilled red snapper - the best I've had and also clearly super fresh. Lemon potatoes are a must have.The dessert was complimentary and clearly homemade and the Greek coffee perfect.I'm not as much of a Yelp reviewer as I'd like to be, but when a place impressed me like this one has, its worth it to take the time and spread the word.Will definitely be back","We started with the Kyra Pikilia - taramasalata was ok, but tzaziki was off the hook. Pita is cooked perfectly, just a little crispy. Gigantes, Aggorontomata salad, saganaki, and oktopodi rounded out the rest of our meal. It all was very, very good. The place has a very family, oriented ambiance and people are shuffled in and out quickly. The kitchen is open and you can see all the specials on your way in. There is always a long wait, even with reservations. Arrive early. Street parking is usually available, but it could get tough depending on when you go. Service is much better if you speak Greek. I don't, but my friends do.","Went in today for lunch, great food, fast service We had the lamb fricasse delicious , the dessert was exceptional halva and galahtopourko which was of course treatedA wonderful neighborhood gem!",Bahari Estiatorio
295,"Update on below: the food is awful (at least when delivered). The meat is rubbery and it jist all looks so unappetizing. Ordered on Uber Eats. They gave the driver the wrong order. He never made it to us. Turned around midway then started coming back to us. Uber estimated another 17mim when I called to express my disappointment to the restaurant. She explained that they gave the driver the wrong order but not as an apology. She also said that the driver will be here in 5min. I told her it's actually 17 and that I was looking for more of an apology than an explanation, but then she started explaining again. Just unpleasant customer service.","Himalayan Yak is located about 2 blocks from Roosevelt Ave/Jackson Hts subway station, which makes it very easy to get to.  The ambiance of the place is really nice, with Himalayan artwork all around and traditional music playing softly in the background.  I also hear there is live music here on Saturday nights, which must make for a unique and authentic experience!  The waitstaff was a bit aloof, but not egregiously so.  Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed by the food.  Instead of ordering full meals, we opted to try a bunch of small plates on the menu.  Of the 5 items we tried, I would only consider ordering the yak gyuma (sausage) again; it was smokey and had a nice flavor.  Everything else from the Macha Tareko (fried smelt) to the pork and chicken momos were, unfortunately, disappointing.  The worst thing we had that night was the yak cheese (and this is coming from a cheese lover).  You know when you keep a hard cheese sitting in a fridge too long and the outside becomes hard and dried out?  That was what we were served.I'm usually inclined to believe that when I have a negative experience at a place most others rave about, that maybe they were just having an off night. So I might check this place out again if convenient, but I def won't seek it out.","Himalayan Yak was our go to place for every trip to NY and for every time we craved for Nepali food while living in NY. We visited Yak during lunch yesterday and sadly we could tell that none of the food from the regular menu was fresh. We ordered chips chilly ( could tell that it was not fresh - had old oil smell, pakora - disgusting, chicken lollipop - they were stale, chicken momos - the worst ever.  It was the first time ever that we threw away food while eating there. I felt nauseous throughout the day and to further add to the bad experience, I had bad diarrhea after eating their food. I was lucky to find the restroom in the middle of the city. Sadly, I have to say now that I am never going back to Yak ever again. They decided to serve us bad food early morning instead of telling us that they could not prepare fresh food in the morning.",How did I never heard of this place before ? Supposedly the most famous restaurants for Nepali food in Jackson height I recently stumbled upon this place The food was really good but got there around lunch time and we were the only two customers I've heard it's popular at night when some famous Nepalese singer from the 90s goes gigs here So cool !,"Yak meat and other products are something not that widely available in US. Yak momo is good. Yak chili momo is simply fried momo in chili sauce, similar to chili chicken. I would prefer regular fried momo, than chili momo. Fried yak gyuma, which is fried yak blood sausage was also good. Tibetan butter tea is a bland and salty form of milk. Not very enjoyable. Napali masala tea is almost same as Indian masala tea. Phapar ko dhendo was a dissapointment. Wheat bread had a sort of raw taste. Goat curry came with it was also not up to the mark. Other sides were not good either.","Vegetarian recs here! I had the aloo kauli tarkari (almost tastes like an indian shaak/subji), tofu chili (exactly what you would expect it to be) and steamed veggie momos (way over ordered for leftovers - it came out to a little over $30 with tip). Would give it 4.5 stars. Loved the music, the decor, the vibe, and the food was great too! A cool spot for a date or just to hang out. The food is well-priced and they serve big portions. The nepalese/himalayan entrees actually come out pretty quickly - it's just the momos that took maybe 15-20 mins.My only gripe are these aren't the best veggie momos I have ever had. They were good, but not amazing. The staff was slightly slow, but great. They even have WiFi and live music was even setting up when I was leaving! :) Would definitely make it back!",Himalayan Yak
296,"Yes this place is more modern looking than the old place. But what happened to this place? The clean plates were dirty. Dry food was still on the plates.Yuck. Ventilation has gotten bad. Service was non existent. I got a knife to cut my own meat. Puddles of water near the meat area. My favorite marinated short ribs had no taste. The meat was tough. Hot food section looked sparse. Chicken wings, string beans,dumplings and corn. The string beans were not trimmed. The people are happy and giddy to get a table after a long wait They don't see the dirty plates or taste the tough meat or care about the bad service. It is more about quantity than the quality of the meat. My gal pal said I know this place is your favorite but there's a lot of ayce Korean bbq restaurants on Northern Blvd. disappointed so I am moving on.","I've been coming here often as a place to go when I crave Korean bbq. Obviously not the best place to go for the most amazing meat but it's a place where we can eat to our hearts content. I've came several times and the food was always good and the service as well. But yesterday I came and I was unexpectedly shocked by this. Our basket of lettuce contains a large bug/fly in between one of the veggies. Its one thing to find hair but to find a bug bigger than my pinky nail. It was utterly disgusting. It wasn't even a small bug. It was big enough for me to see from a distance. Not only that, but I ate most of the veggies from that basket before we realized the last one had been contaminated. GROSS. It's obvious whoever cleaned the lettuce didn't clean it properly. They probably just rinsed it under the water and that's all. We brought the managers attention to it and he offered half price for one person. But still. The meal should have been immediately refunded. We stopped eating anything immediately. Couldn't stomach anything from this place anymore!!",I wish I could give 0 stars! The customer service here is outrageously rude. They do not accommodate big groups (at least not gladly) when the hostess kept making excuses on why we couldn't all sit together and then demanded we sit on opposite sides of the restaurant I knew it was going to be a horrible time not to mention they want to up-charge you an hour before lunch time is over. If you want Korean BBQ and enjoy it in a nice inviting space look elsewhere. Hostess photo attached because I was so shocked about how unaccommodating she was to for our group. When is a big group of people a bad thing for a business?0 stars for me!,"We came here on a Friday night around 9pm and only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. Once we were seated, we began our feast for the night! The food was incredible, and I particularly enjoyed that since this was ACYE, we were able to get the exact portion of meat we wanted (ex: two slices of pork belly rather than a whole plate as it's served in other places) because then we wouldn't need to pay extra for food wasted.The buffet bar with the meats, sauce, rice, and prepared hot foods was continuously stocked throughout the night. The prepared hot food bar had rotating items like two types of chicken wings, bak Choy, scallion pancakes, dumplings, rice, and different types of soup.The meat section had a bunch of different marinated meats, both spicy and non spicy. Our favorites were the marinated kalbi beef short ribs of course! They also had interesting items like spicy pork skin which was very crunchy when cooked.To top it off, we got free ice creams at the end!Overall, This place is great and if you pay with cash you get $3 off per person!","I know Picnic Garden is one of the OG AYCE KBBQ places - it has seen a move to its current larger space due to its popularity (I never went to the original location). Despite only giving three stars I had a pretty good experience here, but the reality is that there is newer competition out there and I like their way of doing things better.PG is a bit more expensive than other AYCE KBBQ places I have been to, but for the extra money their buffet selection is more extensive adding cooked dishes and a little more variety. That is also another issue - it's a buffet. A buffet of raw meat that is sitting out, people are walking around with plates full of raw meat. Raw meat and its juices just all over the place. I'm just not the biggest fan of eating on the same table with raw meat (can I say raw meat one more time? probably). I like other places such as Cast Iron and O2 where the wait staff put the meat directly onto the grill. The galbi was the most popular item with the group I went with and myself - nicely marinated and delicious. The service was very attentive as well - clearing the table, changing the grill, cooking and cutting the meat.Overall I think you will have a good to great experience here, the food and variety is good for the money. I would even come back if friends wanted to eat here, but for the issues explained above and better options available elsewhere makes PG only A-OK in my book.","Picnic is an OG KBBQ spot in the Flushing, Queens area. I remember going there back in middle school, especially during their cheap (cheap!!) lunch hours. The place has moved locations to a much bigger space and nicer interior, but the setup is pretty much the same. You have the buffet spread in the middle of the restaurant stocked with anything from galbi to kitchen-made ddukbokki. This spread hasn't changed much at all because they still have those sushi rolls (never tried, but they've always had this ever since I started going there). The grills are the same too, the silver metal grills.Picnic Garden's food is honestly pretty much like it used to be, but with a slight upgrade. I remember in the past they had frozen pork belly put out at the buffet. Their meat selection is larger than it used to be, which is pretty nice. I can't really complain about the food or the taste. It's standard for KBBQ, but as you probably know, the competition for KBBQ in the area is huge with spots like Cast Iron Pot and O2. Their grilling styles are obviously very different. The only annoying thing I have to point out about Picnic Garden is how fast the meat burns. I used to think that I was just young and dumb  and did not know how to properly grill meat. Better burnt than raw pork right? But after going to places like their competitors, I don't ever have burnt meat like I do at Picnic Garden. I'm not saying it's the restaurant's fault at all, but rather that it's hard to really have conversation as the meat cooks because sometimes you forget, and before you know it, the meat is burnt black. I get you can just move it off the grill and onto a plate, but maybe because I'm used to KBBQ grills where you can move the meat to the edge where it can keep it warm because the fire doesn't concentrate around the edges. That's my only real concern about Picnic Garden. I wouldn't voluntarily suggest to go here anymore because of this burning thing, but it was nice to revisit and take a trip down memory lane. Maybe I'll come back with some friends in the future, not sure, but we'll see! (Also, the prices here for dinner are more expensive than the other KBBQ places I go to now before tip and tax.)",Picnic Garden
297,"I have been here twice. The sweet spiced chicken sandwich is pretty good.  The bulgogi sandwich is a bit disappointed. The bulgogi meat was diced into tiny pieces.  When I open the wrapper,  some of it fell off.  Ut is very difficult to eat in the park.","Take out was a-little slow, when I got my food it was already cold. I didn't like the fact they had it in a plastic plate where I wasn't able to heat it up in a microwave","I wish the boy action Bronson could try this place and tell us what he thinks. I honestly think Omani is one of the best restaurants in nyc. Everything is valid they got no weaknesses. All restaurants got that one item on their menu that's not official but not omani. This place is the muhfucken shiett ma ninja. Last night I fucked around and spent 30$ here. I got the beef quesadilla (shit is crack), pork sandwich with kimchee (just stupid), spicy chicken box (od delicious) and fries (dumb tasty). Might even go back tonight","I ordered:6 piece fried dumplingsorder of friesBeef hero.So I feel a little weird about giving the restaurant 5 stars after just 1 order when only 1 out of 3 items I ordered warrants it, but the beef hero really does warrant it, and I think it's worth it for y'all to check it out. It's reminiscent of a Philly cheesesteak, but with a touch of Korean-bulgogi-ness to it along with a nice portion of semi-spicy cherry peppers chopped up into the sandwich (reminds me of the cherry peppers that Shake Shack uses). The meat is very tender, juicy, and flavorful, and the juices in the sandwich will drip down your hands if you're not careful. I can honestly say it's the best sandwich I've had in a while.I ordered delivery, and it took about 35 minutes, which was under the estimate, and the food arrived very fresh and still hot. The smallish fried dumplings were very crunchy, and even the crinkle-cut fries were still relatively crisp...or as crisp as crinkle-cut fries that were delivered can be. My two cents is that the fries are a pass (I only ordered them to make the $15 minimum) and the dumplings are okay but not mind-blowing, so just order 2 of the sandwiches and save one for later. ;)","I've been in this neighborhood more than half my life now and although I've only had this place a couple of times, I'm never disappointed. The food is always flavored well with good portions.I got the beef bulgogi sandwich my first time and I remember immediately loving it. The flavors had some Mexican food elements with the sweetness of the bulgogi. There were green peppers finally chopped and all the flavors came through very well. I was impressed.I didn't go back as often because I try to not eat out as often to stay healthy, but I got Omani again a couple weeks ago and it was still great. I got a dakgalbi lunch set and it was the perfect portion. I was worried about the dakgalbi being bland, but it was the right amount. Good for a corner store that sells different Korean meals. Dakgalbi is my favorite and there aren't that many places that do it in Queens. Glad to have Omani around! The previous delis in its spot changed owners a lot and I'm glad to see Omani keep going this long. Their staff are super super friendly and make you feel like family. Will be back whenever I'm craving!","Oh Man is their beef bulgogi good! I was going to wait until tomorrow and get one of their beef bulgogi heroes for our flight but wanted to go for a test drive first. A friendly man answered the phone, took my order and told me it'd be ready in 10 minutes. I was warmly greeted when I arrived and after a few minutes I left with the goods. The meal was perfectly placed in its box and smelled amazing. It was well seasoned and spicy enough to enjoy. The test drive was a success and we look forward to our flight meal tomorrow, and hope they're still here when I return.",Omani
298,"I was excited to try Tang because of the exclusive vegetarian menu - a rarity at most Korean restaurants. That was the main reason for making a trek here, deep in the far reaches of Eastern Queens.Things started promisingly enough. The restaurant is spacious but lively, and our first dish to come, the veg japchae, was above average. The kimchi pancake which followed was also excellent.However, the mung bean pancake lacked a kick. The real disappointment was the mushroom soondoobu, which was disgustingly flavourless - one of the worst I've ever had. It is not that hard to make a tasty vegetarian broth, but I guess some restaurants think that if you don't eat meat then you don't enjoy flavor.","Meh.  No Ban Chan.  The Soondubu was not as I expected.  It was lacking major flavor points and it was moderately spiced, even though I asked for it to be spicy.  The Japchae was not flavorful and was dry.  I wouldn't go back.  I should have realized It wouldn't have been good once I noticed the fusion menu.But, they open late!","The Tonkotsu and Sapporo ramens are so oily ! You can see the layer of oil layered on top of the broth , in the spoon and also in the bowl. The Pork chashu are tough and start to get stuck between your teeth when you attempt to try to bite into it. The soft boiled eggs have been marinated in soy sauce like when Koreans make jahng jo leem, so they are salty.","Great food, nice big selection menu with all the additional items.  So good .. all gone ..Big space for family gathering ..","They're open 24/7! They have valet parking but you can also easily find street/residential parking. They're a big restaurant and can easily seat large parties. We arrived with a party of 9 around 7:30pm on a Saturday and it was packed! But we were seated within 15 minutes. I think the best deal has to be the combo menu. You get to pick two dishes for $22 (it was $20 earlier this year ...). My boyfriend and I usually split two combos. I got the kalbi and seafood soondubu, and he ordered the kalbi and bibimbap. They start off with salad and the ginger dressing and a side of kimchi. I can eat salad all day if I had this dressing. Kimchi has a kick to it but it's not that spicy. Our dishes! The kalbi is marinated on the lighter side! It surprisingly makes you crave for more. The combo order comes with 6-7 pieces of kalbi. The soondubu is also yummy and they're generous with the seafood. We also tried the soy garlic wings and they were delicious! The chicken took a lot longer than the other dishes but it was okay since it gave us time to digest our food haha. The sauce is sweeter and less garlic-y. Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside! The service wasn't as attentive when I last went but  they were really busy. I had to ask for napkins and water twice before I received it. Also make note they can only split the bill with a maximum of 3 cards!","Tang has been around for a while now and it's known for being 24 hours. Sometimes if my friends and I are craving Korean food late at night or if someone comes home from a trip late, Tang is always an option for us. We've been going to Tang for years now, way before they started added new things on the menu. Their mixed pancake platter is great. I remember the flavor always being on point and the pancake was crispy. Their jokbal naengchae is also great and super refreshing! Honestly, their jokbal is a highlight for me and my friends. We always devour the dish so quickly because of how tender and not overly salty it is. Their soondaeguk is definitely one of my favorites because it isn't too salty like I've had at other places. The soup is rich and has so many pieces of soondae! Love mixing it with their radish kimchi as well! It's such a great balance when combined. I've gotten plenty of their sets as well and they're all good, nothing much to say. It's all pretty standard. Their Chilean sea bass can be a hit or miss depending on the cut of the fish you get. Sometimes it can be super fatty and salty and sometimes it's perfect and tons of meat. I feel like it's a little bit of luck needed here. The flavors are definitely heavy on the fish where I normally wouldn't go for it, but albeit, my friends love it. The only thing I didn't like was their soondubu because it's not that flavor I'm used to and it's a bit watery? The flavors are also not very deep, but I never go to Tang for their soondubu. I love that they serve salad first for free because salad is a great starter especially if you're eating a heavy meal. I learned this trick from watching a korean mukbang Star that said he always ate salad first to ""open up the stomach and build a foundation"". Great starter! I also enjoy their radish kimchi cause it's super crunchy, but they don't give that much (usually hidden under the kimchi), so you'll have to ask for more.I've always had a pleasant experience whenever I came! I don't think I've listed all that I've tried. Although I can't say I will try their pho or ramen because I choose this place for their korean items, but I do wonder how they taste here! They have korean fried chicken and other fusion items! My friend and her family also always get sushi as well. Their menu is huge and they're always adding new things. It kind of makes them a central hub for food especially when they're 24 hours! I think that's a pretty smart move.",Tang Restaurant
299,I've been coming here for the past three and a half years and the only thing I eat is the spicy kara miso ramen noodle soup and their vegetable and pork dumplings.,"I was disappointed.  I love tan tan ramen but their tan tan ramen doesn't taste tan tan ramen. It's just spicy no flavor. Gyoza tastes premade from factory.I'm Japanese. I think this place is probably owned by Korean owner. Food doesn't taste real.But, it's ok quality, but it doesn't taste Japanese Japanese food for me.",Got the champon ramen to go and it was still good when it arrived. Broth and noodles were tasty but there could be more seafood,"A chill ramen shop with friendly staff.The recommended items,CroquettesFried chickenMy friends had the ramen, which looked delicious.They have nice decorations. The music was a bit loud. They have decent bathrooms in the back. It's a great spot to stop by before visiting the Noguchi Museum or Socrates Park.","I have a really interesting story with this place because I stumbled in here for a quick lunch a few years ago when I was just a college student taking my first solo trip to NYC. I wasn't familiar with Astoria and never bookmarked it, so I was never able to come back and find it after I moved here. Now I live here and my bf and I stumbled in here once and immediately it hit me that this was the spot! Very special.Nostalgia aside, let's talk about the restaurant itself.Staff: 10/10 very friendly and attentive Ramen: 5/10Broth -- flavor is 60% there, but something is not tasting the best in the broth. I feel like with a bit of more research and development, finding out what is affecting the taste can help bring the broth to 100%Noodles -- noodles tasted like sun noodles that you could buy at Asian grocery stores. Not badPork Chashu -- a bit fatty, I don't feel like the fat rendered into the meat or anything. It just tasted like a chunk of fat.","Easily a 3.5. Thought the service was fine and ambience pleasant with ramen like vibes as soon as you walk in. Pros were the vast menu and drink options, as well as the spot being open till 11 on weeknights. Cons were just the overall taste of the apps (Gyoza & Pork Buns) and ramen there. It was decent and expected for ramen, but nothing to rave about or go out of the way for. The best thing about this restaurant has to be its location. With not a lot of ramen in the Astoria area, it's extremely convenient when you're craving a fix and don't feel like trekking to the busiest Burroughs and waiting in line.",Tamashii Ramen
300,"Food is fantastic but I have to take a star off for service. The server we had didn't speak a lot of English but managed to get by. He just wasn't super bright as a waiter because we had 6 people in our party, but he kept bringing 5 of each item (extra napkins, bowls, and spoons). We checked in for the free milk tea, which was super tasty and had lots of tea flavor. Also, be sure to call to make a reservation - game changing move.","Calling them cheaters maybe too harsh but I won't return.Three aging women having lunch. My friend said to the staff as she was ordering the Boiled Fish with Picked Veg, ""... we'd like to have the small."" - this dish comes in two sizes.""Yes, small would do."" We said. We don't and couldn't eat a lot.But when xicao (西曹) soup dish came in this giant bowl, we knew instantly it's the large size. We asked why but the staff just shrugged and walked away. We let it go. But we won't return.The food: average.The serving plates and bowls are pretty neat. The tea pot is heavy which I don't mind - good exercise for my bicep, tricep 4-cep ...  hey ... summer is coming -:).The decoration: above average in Flushing. Good ceiling height. But the booths by the window are uncomfortable: too far from the table and the couches are too low for the table. The worst: the glassed tables have greasy streaks. I had visited it when it was first opened and sat on the table, which had no glass.The service: was subpar. I have to signal for tea all the time, especially when it wasn't busy at all. They didn't offer rice, not even asked if we need or want rice. Again, we have to ask for it.Bathroom: a public bathroom, a little walk from the restaurant. Cute washbowls (the white towels underneath are ugly...) but a dirty bathroom.There was a dirty dish station by our table: I'm wondering, the restaurant is nearly empty, why can't they move it elsewhere or do NOT throw in the dishes n chopsticks. Unless, they meant to chase us away. We were there for less than two hours.The elevators are SLOW, very slow. Ten minutes slow. Parking is in the basement for the mall.",nice food for flushing.很好Yahhhhhhniceeeeeeeeenice food for flushing.很好Yahhhhhhniceeeeeeeeenice food for flushing.很好Yahhhhhhniceeeeeeeee,"Pretty delicious meal for a good price. Daxi Sichuan is located on the top of New World Mall. You're supposed to scan a QR code at the entrance, but that brings you to a page that's only in Chinese. My friends and I all couldn't read it and then thankfully, a waiter emerged out of no where and brought us to an available table. The couches are covered in a strange cloth. The table comes with a saffron tea. The wooden chairs on the other side of the couch were surprisingly very comfortable. This is definitely a Chinese, family-style restaurant. There's delicious free bubble tea with your Yelp check-in. The bubbles aren't regular chewy bubbles. The texture of these are closer to grass jelly and aren't sticky at all. I like them better. The quality of the milk tea is good too.For lunch, we ordered a cold century egg dish with a delicious garlic sauce & scallions, shovel chicken with numbing corn peppers and a ton of spicy peppers, pork belly with pickled vegetables under, and steamed egg white with ground meat on top. All of these were very good over rice. All the flavors were very different from what Cantonese cooking has. My favorite dish was the century egg dish. The sauce in the center is so good over rice. I'd like to come back to try some Sichuan style seafood and desserts. Took off one star because for such a big restaurant, I was surprised there was no bathroom located inside of it. My friends would be gone for a while because it was so far away and we lost out on quality time.","I wanted to try this place for a long time, today is mid autumn festival, so I took my bf here for dinner.We got here at around 7ish. The line was really long but no biggie, it's a Friday night so we can wait. The waitress at the front of the restaurant told us to scan a QR code to get checked in, and there were 12 tables in front of us. It was a easy process and I thought it was nice that we can track the tables on my phone.We walked around and came back to the restaurant when the website said there were 6 tables in front of us. Then, 45 mins passed, still 6 tables. I went up to the waitress and asked how long will it still be. She told me around 10 mins. I kept waiting, and one of the lady was complaining about the long wait, I overheard that she said she's number A32, I was A22. The waitress told the lady there were 2 tables ahead of her. So I realized that the tracking website is crushed, and it haven't been updating. I went up to the waitress again and asked how many tables are ahead of me, she told me 2 tables. Which doesn't make sense at all, apparently I came before the lady who has the 32 number because I was 22. Then some table got cleared out, instead of going by number, the waitress decided to let people who got upset with her in first. So be careful, if you are waiting PATIENTLY and POLITELY, sorry but you DON'T get to sit down at this place. We finally sat down after I told her that she already let 3 tables in, while she told me there were only 2 tables  in front of me. The food took about 45 mins to come. By the time we got our food it's 10:15 pm already. One of our dish never came, we had to cancel it because we have finished everything else, and waited for about 15 mins. The food was really good and tasted authentic, however the service really needs some work. For the amount of stress and starvation this place had put me through, I don't think I'll be back another time for the food. There are many more great Sichuan food in Flushing, this isn't the one and only.","Ok so I really wanted to like this place because it's rated highly on Yelp and from the pics the food looked good.My family and I stopped by Daxi because I wanted to eat some Sichuan food for my birthday. We've never eaten Sichuan food before. The menu was mostly pictures so ordering was a breeze, we just pointed to what we wanted. It didn't take too long for the food to come out.I was hyped about trying some Sichuan food. Food review time:The pig ears we got were standard, nothing special. Taste like what you would get from a soondae restaurant. The pork with chestnuts looked good but the flavor was meh. I felt like it needed something. Also, the pork was very dense.We also had the country rice (I forgot the name) which had green beans, chestnut and pork pieces in it. Initially, it was pretty good but it got saltier the more you ate it.The fish was the worst thing I ever had. I knew Sichuan had the numbing spice but it just wasn't for me. I did not like the sauce that they used on the fish. However my family was fine with it.The last dish we ordered was the kung pao shrimp which honestly wasn't that bad, it was on the sweet-side but it was fine. Not my favorite though. Honestly the best part of the meal was the Tsingtao beer. The flavoring of the food was off like it wasn't bland but it wasn't bursting with flavor. Everything had a neutral taste to it if you know what I mean.So would I go back? No. Was it a good experience? Yea! I'm glad I tried Sichuan food and I now I know that I'm not a huge fan of it.",Daxi Sichuan 大喜
301,PappaRich is still one of my favorite places for Malaysia food.  It is situated at the second floor of the building with outdoor seating.  This set up is rare in the busy and crowded Flushing downtown area.I feel that the food is authentic and the price is reasonable.   They do offer a variety choices of selections.  This is my go-to place for Malaysian food in Flushing.,"The food, price and service was alright. The cleanliness was not the best. I really liked their beef satay, extremely yummy but everything else was average.",Their food is really good and cheap as well.I ordered one day the iced coffee tea but it was nasty :/ is just a drink but the food you must order a few dishes if you come with a partner because it's not enough! But the curry sauce is the best :)) their service is kinda bad but hey they're always busy!,"I can't believe how long it took me to try PappaRich!This place is good, but not great. If you're looking for a Malaysian place that is clean for large groups this is the place for you.We were a party of 5 on a Sunday night and we chose to sit outside. The ambiance was nice for the Flushing area. It did take a while to get a waiters attention which I guess could be expected as it was a busy night.We were seated outside and had just enough attention from the waiter. I ordered the hainanese chicken. A typical dish, it was delicious, just the right amount of flavor and not dry.A great place to visit with friends and family to catch-up and have decent Malaysian food.","I can't believe how long it took me to try PappaRich!This place is good, but not great.

I think I've had slightly better Malaysian food in the past, but this place almost has it all, and I thought they did a wonderful job handling us.Given the large selection of food on the menu, the ordering process is very easy- you're given a little slip of paper to write down numbers corresponding to the menu items and desired quantities = less social interaction for me yayyy lol jk. The menu is very visual, like a huge colorful children's picture book of food, so it's very easy to see and expect what you're ordering. Upon handing our waiter the slip, it seemed like she had memorized and was able to recognize some of the numbers/items. She ensured that all of our food came out in the desired order, like if we wanted the dessert to come out along with all the food or after the meal.I ordered two drinks because I couldn't help myself- the 3-layer rose syrup milk tea and the lychee cincau. Both were excellent and came with grass jelly, my favorite! The rose milk tea was perfectly sweet and the lychee cincau was like a melted lychee slushy with actual lychee in it, which was super refreshing while I had some of the spicier foods. For apps we started with the mixed chicken/beef satay skewers and the roti canai. The satay was just okay, a bit too dry for me, but the peanut sauce compensated for the texture. The roti was delicious, soft yet crisp, and came with 3 different sauces. Those two went very quickly.While the rest of our table shared dishes family-style, I ordered my own entree, which was the nasi lemak, a staple Malaysian dish with coconut rice, sambal (chili) shrimp, curry chicken, peanuts, anchovies, and a hard boiled egg. I thought it was pretty decent; all the components blended together nicely. Funny story...my mom accidentally spilled a glass of water on my nasi lemak, but the waitress was kind enough to transfer the untouched parts of the dish onto a new plate and give a replacement cup of coconut rice. I was also able to have a taste of the steamed hainan chicken - very flavorful - and the lamb, which was thoroughly cooked and had a pretty strong kick to it. All of us really enjoyed the food!As promised, my pre-ordered dessert was ready right as I finished my entree. I ordered cendol, caramelized coconut milk-flavored shaved ice with wormlike green jellies and sweet beans at the bottom. It is certainly a shareable dish after stuffing oneself with all of that food. The proportion of flavoring to shaved ice was perfect- sometimes I get shaved ice with too much or too little flavoring so the dessert is too concentrated or diluted, but fortunately that wasn't the case here. The place gets very busy around dinner time as most Flushing restaurants, but the service manages to keep on top of it all despite the bustle. The restaurant is well-maintained and clean. Definitely come here if you're looking to try Malaysian food for the first time or just want to satisfy a craving!",PappaRich Flushing
302,The restaurant did not informed me that they accept cash only today. The waitress and the manager told me to walk to ATM to get the cash out. I said I will not walk to the bank because it is inconvenient to me. After long time the manager came back stating that she will take a picture of my debit card!!! I told her NO because someone stole my identity before and I will not let anyone to take a pic of my debit card. She went crazy on me saying that something is wrong with me !!! How can you disrespect customer that come to your restaurant 2 times per week.... I will never return to this place!!! Also customers can't fix management mistake remember you will loose customers acting like that !!!,"Got a takeout of six tacos(2 Shrimp, Chicken, Al Pastor, Carnita and Carne Asada) today! When I opened the bag and found one rectangle takeout box (generic black box with clear plastic case), I thought they forgot to give me the complete order. Alas, there were six tiny tacos (worth $29.94) all over each other in one box. The Shrimp and Chicken Tacos were okay. The mango raspberry chipotle sauce from the Shrimp Tacos was yummy but was spilled all over the other tacos. All in all, not a satisfying experience. I will give this place one more try though.",Their system is set that you tip on the tax as well which is illegal and SO WRONG and if you dont pay attention to the number you are being schemed wo knowing. ILLEGAL,"I love the happy hour here. The tacos are great, the guacamole and not to mention the sangria. It's usually very busy by peak happy hour time, but if the weather is good there's also outdoor seating. One of my favorite chill happy hour spot. Cute little Fias de Los Muerto decor. Conveniently located on Broadway.","I have been wanting to try Las Catrinas for a while and we finally decided to go last night, however i wish we did not. First and foremost I want to say this restaurant checks all the boxes when it comes to service, ambience, music and presentation of the food. 5 stars across for that. Our server was polite,attentive and personable. Main complaint is honestly the food. The food LOOKS great- and that's what drew us in. We were impressed with all the photos of the food on Yelp. However everything was incredibly bland. No seasoning on anything, The avocados in the guacamole weren't ripe (the avo shortage I know but just don't serve it then) and the drinks were EH. To be honest I don't think I would come back, defiantly left a lot to be desired and I think there are much better places in terms of Mexican food in Astoria.","The staff here are very friendly and accommodating. I noticed that although it gets busy, they don't ever try to rush you, which I always appreciate! The food is decent. Not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but certainly not the worst either. I will say that even though the dish may not say, be prepared that our dishes were very spicy! We never asked for extra spice, and the menu didn't state it but just something to be aware of if you aren't a huge spicy food lover. The drinks were nice. Sangria was good, and margarita on the rocks was also very good. Another friend got a frozen margarita and that was overpoweringly sweet. Stick to on the rocks! Overall not a bad place but not somewhere I would run to again. Worth a shot if you're in the area though",Las Catrinas Mexican Bar & Eatery
303,"Place is a big joke. First and foremost, this place is clearly racist. All patrons and everyone worked there was white. Clearly targeted, my server made weird comments through the night including asking if I asked for soy sauce when I asked for steak sauce and ordered steak and more. This girl took my card, added it to her digital wallet (Apple Pay) and wiped out my account - both checking and savings at three different ATMs in Bedford. I hope she is reading this because her dumb self got caught in every single camera and I'm having the police arrest her today. This establishment's owner after all of this, did not even offer a refund, didn't even apologize, didn't do anything actually. He kept saying luckily everything is on camera and evaded my question of me asking 5x if there were any blind spots. I'm also following through with a legal suit to this restaurant so probably won't be opened in the next 5 months. They really messed with the wrong New Yorker.","This place is a complete joke. After coming here for dinner last night, one of the employees added my card to their digital wallet and stole money from me, attempted to do it 2 more times and now this has been escalated to the police. They didn't even offer to refund the $100 dinner plus tip or actually anything for the experience. How disgusting is this establishment that you cannot trust a SERVER with your card?","Their steak is decent, most of the time I love their mashed potatoes. Not sure if it's a mix? Or real. Last time it tasted out of a box. Consistent. But, all I've had is the steak and burger. I won't order the burger again. It was disappointing.",Being new to Astoria I suck at I sought out a bunch of bars.As you can see I've been to several this place was amazing I definitely suggest that if you're new to the neighborhood or living in the neighborhood that you stop by and give this place a try.My service was amazing my food was amazing and I couldn't say enough about my great experience,"Ok let me break it down. It's hard to rate this place cuz it needs separate ratings for food drink and atmosphere. Overall it's more like a 3.5-4 stars. The staff is great 5 stars The drinks are good although I had a terrible martini. All olive juice. But lots of different kinds of beer. 4 stars. The food is the problem. It's just ok. 3-3.5 stars. And I want to give more stars cuz I really like the place but it came down to food for me. It's just. Ok.Overall it's a great neighborhood place but basically come for drinks, the lovely staff, and for a nice big place to hang and get some snacks. I'd stick to the basics. Fries wings etc. They have Happy hr 5-750 cent wings Tuesdays1/2 price burgers Thursday's The mac and cheese was eh. Missing flavor and pasta. I stuck my fork in so many times and missed. Needs more pasta and a bigger shape noodle. I had the special. Caesar Salad w grilled calamari which is probably my bad for ordering at a bar. I asked for dressing on side and it came dressed. I didn't send it back. The salad was creamy and not fishy but so overly dressed. Sooo much dressing. And the Calamari rings were cut up. They were just bland. Weren't grilled. They seemed boiled. Very chewy.","My friend and I tried this place for lunch. The lady who served us must be the one many reviewers raved about. She is a sweetheart. Very pleasant and accomodating, so much so that i wish I could have given this place an extra star. We had sticky wings and stuffed clams for appetizers- wings were pretty good, clams were okay.I also ordered french onion soup, which was unedible due to the salt content.  The lady saw it mostly uneaten and asked if it was okay. I told her it was salty. She was kind enough to  not charge me and apologized that the soup was actually really salty. I then had shrimp tacos which they offered as a special- i ate it, but again the chef seemed to be  really preoccupied with salting things to death. I was very thirsty for a few hours after.For beer drinker and wing lovers, i guess this would be the spot. Im sure their burgers and other pub foods should be okay, but they really need to improve on the food overall. The service from that lady was really wonderful.",The Brewery Bar & Kitchen
304,Service makes the establishment. It makes or breaks your dinner or lunch experience at a place. I've been here countless of times and not once have I had trouble until today. I can in on a Saturday for lunch and our server ELLA. Decided she was too busy for us and seemed as if we gave her a hassle when we ordered more drinks. We ordered two bubble teas and then later asked for an orange juice. Most servers would gladly take our order and give us no problem with it. But Miss ELLA decided it was appropriate to sight loudly and gave us an annoyed face. There's only one other establishment that I've ever had to bring to yelp about their service. This is the second. This is unacceptable! My table of 6 gave her no hardship. We only asked for more drinks.,"My go-to spot for AYCE Chinese food. They've got it all: sushi, Peking duck, ramen, sashimi, steak, mayo shrimp, just to name my first plate. They keep the place tidy and since it's always crowded, the food keeps getting freshly replenished so nothing really sits out for too long. I believe during rush hour you only get 1.5 hours of eating time so don't sit and chat, EAT EAT EAT!",I came to this place with high expectations - unfortunately they were not met.  The restaurant is located in a building with a private lot with valet parking that is reasonable - important in Flushing where finding a parking spot is difficult.  Don't forget to have restaurant staff validate your parking ticket in order to get the discounted rate.Buffet with multiple items.  I wasn't impressed with the selection.  Food rather bland.  Seafood did not taste fresh.  Best part was probably the desert table.  Drinks are included in the buffet but they are watered-down.  Price for buffet is high for the offerings/quality you get here.,"My parents love their Chinese cuisine so this was the perfect place to bring them for a buffet (for my graduation lunch; hey late is better than never right?)After being led to our table, we got to place drink orders immediately. Yes do get the milk tea. I don't know what type of milk tea it is but it's unlike the boba store milk teas that's for sure. It actually reminds me of royal milk tea in a way.I took a bit of everything to see which ones I would like to get more of. I'd pass on the fried stuff. Dishes that stood out to me were: steak (in some delicious teriyaki sauce?), clams in black bean sauce, steamed clams, mussels...yeah I mostly stuck to seafood cuz it was friggin' delicious!They also have a nice dessert selection too. There were three desserts with sago in them but just go for the mango sago one. The other two weren't sweet at all...the ice cream is great too! Don't forget to top it off with some strawberry, chocolate or mango syrup.Pretty cheap parking too; $2 for 2 hours! Make sure to get that stamp on the parking ticket!P.S. You might be vying with people for the crawfish and crab legs (saw people just pile heaps onto their plates) but the staff were awesome at replenishing the food","I recently went with a bunch of friends to this place. We had wanted to meet up so I consulted Yelp for a good place that was close to Flushing (Norinori didn't serve lunch on weekdays anymore). And I found The Buffet.Ohmigosh. I was blown away by how much it's interior did not look like your typical Chinese buffet. It was super clean and very pleasant on the eyes. Moving onto the food, it was great! In the cold food section, they had sashimi, raw oysters, soft shell crab, shrimp, green mussels, and of course sushi!I myself prefer hot food. They had clams cooked in this really yummy sauce, dimsum, fried rice, fried noodles. They also had this dish called Korean something veal I believe. It was delicious. I kept going back for seconds. The sauce that the veal was cooked in was absolutely delicious. I didn't eat much of their dessert selections. Kidding. I tried one of everything. The chocolate is pretty cool looking but the chocolate tastes like dark chocolate and I prefer milk. The pastries were okay, typical buffet pastries. They had frozen yogurt in vanilla and mango flavor. It was a bit watery. I also got a crepe. I think they overcooked it because when I started to eat it it was crispy, and I know that crepes aren't supposed to be so crispy that they start to break into pieces. There was also cotton candy. That was pretty good.As for the drinks, I only got water. I forgot they had bubble tea but I will definitely try that the next time I return!At around the end of the lunch period, their workers usually start helping themselves to whatever food is left at the buffet.","I am telling you this is an amazing buffet. Filled with everything you want Although the smaller then expected the food selection didn't disappoints. My dad and mom got plates and plates of raw oysters and clams. The oysters were phenomenal Not fishy at all and I have to say I enjoyed the cotton candy and chocolate fondue a lot also. My favorite pick of all, had to be the giant clam they offered. Sweet and steamed in its own juices. It was already cut up for you so it was easy to eat. Amazing amazing food. Definitely would come again",The Buffet
305,"In here you will receive the freshest ingredients of sushi you ll ever have! A must try! You may hv to wait a little cause they are very busy, but well worth it! High level sushi with decent price! The meal as shown if you eat at mid town might cause you 200+ but i pay only less than 100! With this quality of sushi is a steal!! Me personally eat there years but finally hv time to make this review, nuff says! Try for yourself and prove me wrong! Lol !!We have Uni sashimi, sashimi for 2, lobster roll and softshell crab roll!","No hot food except some small appetizers.  Spicy rolls taste like cream, no texture of actual fish In it.  The nigiri pieces have barely any rice and is poorly assembled. Prices are high for rolls .  Overall the food tastes fresh and the staff is nice, but I wouldn't come back here again.   Plenty of other choices.","Holy crap this place is beyond small. There's no bathroom so be easy on the drinks.The door is left wide open allowing flying insects to travel in and dine with you whilst there's AC on. I'm not quite sure how leaving the door open makes sense. I was playing tennis with the mosquitos. Their tap water is refreshing. We ordered two rolls each. I had the shrimp tempura and spicy crunchy salmon roll. He had something fancy -- I forget what but every time we have sushi I always enjoy his more (side eye). The rolls relied  heavily on the condiments to give them flavor. The shrimp tempura roll was huge and difficult to eat in regards to being completely filled with cucumbers and a piece of shrimp. The tempura batter was a soggy mess. Their idea of ""crunchy"" is rice crispy cereal mixed in with mashed salmon and rolled up and then served on a plate. Two stars for their lackluster sushi, but on the bright side the waitress was very accommodating when I told her the salmon was not fresh. She didn't charge my beau for the roll. Never again.","In Forest Hills for over a decade, Sushi Time has attracted a devoted crew of regulars for whom it is a second kitchen. I'll try to explain why. Sushi Time is more than the sum of its parts: the food is good but not very complex, the space is pleasant and clean but it's a bit cramped, and the prices are reasonable but not spectacular bargains. What makes Sushi Time stand out is that it's a restaurant that feels like home: the staff is always laughing together, and I frequently see the same customers coming in over and over again. The menu is hearty and changed every season to accommodate changes in temperature. The free boiling hot green tea is always welcome. Ideal meal: in winter, my wife and I come in and order Miso Soup,  Spicy Salmon Roll, and an Udon Vegetable Noodle Soup at dusk. It's a delicious hearty meal that makes early nightfall seem pleasant.  May this place never change!",Probably the best sushi place in queens!!!!Nothing close compares to them. Highly recommend.,"Sushi Time's online presence is a mess, so I decided to order takeout. A sushi combo box and gyoza. I got my food after a 10 minute wait. They packed the sushi nicely and there were plenty of napkins and soy sauce packets in the bag. They forgot the spoon for the miso soup that came with the combo box. The sushi was great and went well with the spicy mayo I ordered. The portions were small, however. In fact, each individual piece of maki, nigiri, and sashimi was smaller than they are everywhere else. The side salad came with sauce (ginger I think) and was probably the best plain salad I've had at a sushi place, but it's hard to get excited about a plain salad side. The option to get a side of rice or something else instead would have been nice. The gyoza was good, but it was slightly bland. The containers they use are made of cheap, non-microwave-safe plastic (#6), although you're not likely to have leftovers. Not a bad choice, but you can probably find better places nearby, especially if you're not dining in.",Sushi Time
306,Service and food flavor is excellent! The thing is...i visited here twice....i had food poison twice! I had to use bathroom before i left the restaurant. Not sure if the food was not refresh or too much oil. Not gonna take the risk :(((,"We got the sea bass with a double flavor pot! Specifically we got the spicy tofu pudding ( it's actually spicy)It definitely hit the spot, I personally don't eat fish with bones, but this was totally manageable and no surprised bones! So delish!My only complaint is that the potatoes were not soft enough, but that's a personal preference ( I like really soft potatoes)","Had to check out this place as a friend recommended. It is hot and spicy. We ordered the Frog Hot Pot and Grilled Squid. The Frog Hot Pot is a must try, but didn't really care for the squid. The restaurant is very crowded with Chinese as you can imagine it is in Flushing. Restroom was not very clean. There is limited parking. It's not a place that I would go back. There is another place that has better frog dishes. Check my other reviews for that.","Came here with a friend for dinner and it was great!We ordered the sea bass ($49.95) after being told that it was less bony than the other options. The sizes of the fishes, however, are fixed, usually 2-lb. The portion is quite large and would probably be ideal for three people. We selected the tofu pudding flavor and opted for the 4 veggies for $9 deal, choosing enoki mushrooms, black fungus, cabbage, and asparagus. There are a variety of flavors to choose from, ranging from mild to spicy, but we wanted ours with some spice. The service was superb and our server gave us his recommendations and advice because it was our first time there. He periodically changed our plates and made sure the spice level was to our liking, offering to add more soup if it was too much. Overall, I'd definitely come back! It is on the pricier side, but if splitting among more people, it's reasonable. You're also given a complimentary grass jelly dessert after the meal, which is perfect to cleanse your palate from all that chili oil.","The food is okay,just little too spicy, and the fish feel not very fresh. Other dish like normal Sichuan taste. The restaurant is clean and service is good. Price also as average in flushing area. With all I give 4 stars and might come back next time","Yummy and cheap eats for lunch!I came with 2 of my sisters and we ordered the sea bass fish with the spicy tofu pudding. It wasn't really ""spicy"" for me but more Mala. The fish did have a few bones but just keep an eye out while eating and you'll  be ok. The fish was delicious and flavorful with the sauce. We also ordered the squid skewers which came out great! The texture wasn't overly chewy where your jaws get tired.The menu is in Chinese with English subs in the bottom. It's sort of confusing to understand but the staff are more than willing to help out and answer any questions you have.We also came with 2 babies and they gave us a big table to leave room for the strollers!",Hot Space Grilled Fish
307,"Worst service.. Period! 40 mins passed and still didn't get serve our bfast so decided to write a review about it. The worst part of the waiting is they served someone else who walked in after us. I asked the server about the wait time and she said she will find out and never came back. I had to go ask her again. It's not like they are having a busy morning with restraint full of customers. I would understand if that's the case. I can't believe what just happened, they served another customer who walked like 15 mins ago. Anyways we are leaving right now. Enough if enough. Anyone wanna eat here, be prepare to wait close to an hour. And don't go asking what happening to your order or why they are serving others first who came after you, because the owner will put an argument that I ordered French toast which apparently takes over an hour to prep. Just save yourself and don't go there.",Closed for renovation but yelp shows as open.  Drove for 45 min to that place just to see it's closed with Spanish note on a window which I didn't understand.,"I have to update my review.  I used to like that place, but last 3 or 4 times i've been very disappointed and probably won't be back.  My last visit was on Sunday and the new girl that works there obviously not good at multi tasking.  They need more people!  We came for breakfast and there were probably 3 tables with customers we ordered and waited, but people from the street keep coming in to get coffee or other small things and the girl keep ringing them up completely forgetting that our coffee is on a counter getting cold.  I had to get up and ask her for our coffee after waiting for good 8-10 min.  One of the reasons i liked their coffee because it would come with hot milk, but she got us cold milk and I had to bother her again for hot milk.  She never refilled out cups and she got my order wrong bringing only one order instead of two like I asked.  I had to sit and wait while my family was eating.   The prices are hight the food was OK and service was horrible.  I am def. not going back.","If you're looking for good food at an amazing price,this is the place to go! With all natural refreshing juices that is simply perfect for this summer weather. And the breakfast sandwiches are great too! Ps. Take the large juice, otherwise you'll regret.","Love this place. One taco was big enough to fill my stomach and it was only $3.50! I tried the Chorizo-Chicken taco, which had everything I wanted: a spicy kick, cilantro, guac, well-seasoned chicken, and a taco holder. The Banana split waffle here is also amazing and not too sweet. I tried the Spinach omelette as well and it was good but also a taste you can find anywhere in any decent diner or cafe. Finally, the orange juice is a MUST here - it's so addicting! But while the other items on the menu are reasonably priced if not cheap, one orange juice (regular size) is about $5.50 and the large size is ~$10. Regardless, you must try! Most highly recommend.","This place is amazing! Being Mexican myself I can tell good Mexican food and this place delivers. It is small, however the food more than makes up. The owners are awesome and always remember us when we come. My favorite is the cactus with eggs and beans! This place just rocks! It's usually full with people which attest to the food quality.",The Haab
308,"For this visit I was not as impressed with the food as I was the first time. The quality has definitely eroded from my first visit. The specifics are simple.... over cooked rice on  the arroz can Moriscos and a shameful serving on the smallest mussels I have ever had.  Honestly it was just bad, I could have had better on Roosevelt Avenue. But maybe tonight was not a good night for them as my meal came when the rest of my party was almost  finished with their dinner! They did bring out a complementary dessert platter, but sorry that does not compensate for a lousy dish!!!! The crispy chicken I am told was good, as was the Grilled salmon and the appetizers.  The service was also not as good as our previous visit.","I came here on a Thursday with my parents for my mother birthday brunch celebration. When we came in, the hostesses was great and seated us to our table. Once we were seated our server Angelica came and introduced herself and began taking our order. We ordered a bottle of wine and informed her that we would like 3 glasses since there were 3 of us. When she returned with our wine, we had only received 2 glasses. Informed her that we just need one more glass of wine and with an unpleasant gesture she stated that she will bring the other glass once my dad came in from parking. Our entrees were served, my parents and I were having a great time UNTIL she took away our plates once we were finished. While she took away our plates SHE DROPPED FOOD onto my mother's white shirt. She then had the look of surprised due to this event. SHE DID NOT APOLOGIZE after this event and left once my dad PICKED up the food that SHE HAD DROPPED onto my mother's shirt. After few minutes when we asked for the check i informed her that she had dropped food onto my mother's shirt and that she didn't even apologize for the action. She stated that she did, she THEN TRIED TO BLAME IT on my father stating that it was him who picked up the food and that's why it had stained. I had to remind her that regardless who picked up the food the shirt would've still be stained because the food directly dropped on my mother's shirt. She apologized and left the table. While i was waiting for my check i saw that her and the bartender were having a discussion and i was SURE that it was regarding the conversation i just had with angelica b.c the bartender kept giving unpleasant stares directly towards our table. After the incident she bring over a dessert informing us that the dessert was on the house for her mistake. Although she gave us a ""dessert on the house"" I am leaving a 1 star review because during my time there I felt very uncomfortable during my interactions with the server. She was not friendly and tired to blame her mistake on someone else. I would not have felt sour or upset with this experience if she just owned up to her mistake and apologized from the start.",The food was amazing however we were charged for things we did not order. Our table ordered 2 bowls of guacamole and we were charged for four. Each guacamole was $12 dollars. We should have been charged only $24 but we were charged $48. I would just be careful checking your receipt before leaving.,"My daughters pick for a double celebration venue. I have higher expectations to the place  basing on the reviews I have read  prior dining. Seeing  few guests wearing sneakers and jeans was a turned off when we checked in. I know it's not in the control of the management if guests are more comfortable wearing those style but to diners... have consideration as the owners are trying to level up their place. The wait staff service was excellent... it covered my dissatisfaction in the beginning. Additionally, the food was delicious  ( I had paella, my family seemed happy with what  they've ordered) and honestly their sangrias were the best. Although the Manhattan  skyline was partially covered now by the ferry station, dining with the best skyline in the world view still one of the restaurants best perks.  Did I mentioned that it was pleasantly surprising to know that they allowed us in bringing our own birthday cake and oh well served to us with no trouble asking for it? Parking spot is difficult to find so it's  valet service is a big plus. It was funny though that the attendant took time looking for our car where it was just parked on the street in front of us. There is a free photo opportunity of the skyline within walking distance. A recommended place for a celebration.","I attended a Yelp Elite event at Blend on the Water many years ago, and decided to celebrate my 29th birthday here since I remember having such a good time! Be sure to make reservations, and dress to impress because the evening atmosphere will call for it. They dim the lights a bit too much, but their menus have LED backlights and the staff will provide additional candles upon request.As far as food and drink goes, everything I've tried here has been very good - but I especially recommend the seafood paella and pernil. My brother is vegan and I appreciate that they offer a meatless pollo a la plancha, as well. Valet parking can be a little slow on the way out, but it's easier than trying to find a spot in this part of LIC. Speaking of location, be sure to get a few photos with the waterfront view of the skyline right behind the restaurant afterwards - it truly encapsulates our beautiful city.","This place is AMAZING. Everything about it is top notch. **Strongly suggest making a reservation**First, we arrived and were greeted by the valet gentlemen (very busy.) We had a reservation for 8pm on a Friday and were seated right away. Our waitress came over and asked our drink order. We got a frozen margarita and a margarita on the rocks.We shared with the guacamole and then Chorizo Mac & Cheese as an appetizer. Guacamole we thought was going to be table side. It wasn't that great, so we'd skip that next time. But the Chorizo Mac & Cheese was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Strongly suggest. Wasn't too spicy.Entrees; we both did the Churrasco skirt steak. I asked for my steak well done but it came out medium. Our waitress didn't check on us for a while that I ended up eating it, but I definitely would have sent it back. The view is what makes this place. The restaurant has huge glass windows that you can see out of. Very dim light, romanic set up.  We saw lots of birthdays being celebrated here too.",Blend on the Water
309,"What happened to this place?  I have been coming here for the past couple of months and up to this point, it was delicious.However, at least for the namesake, that has all changed.  They have recently changed the broth.  This is it.  Your name is Pho Grand, you better make sure the soup is authentic.  The broth doesn't taste like Vietnamese beef broth anymore.  The spices and fragrances weren't there.  I was immediately taken aback, it was so obvious.  My sister had gone a week prior and noticed the same thing, but didn't mention it to me because she thought it was a once off.I know this is a Chinese run place (Pho Che is run by Koreans), but they were able to make the correct broth in the past and that's what convinced me to return.  It's very disappointing.  I feel like this was a bait and switch.In addition, they are quite stingy with the side vegetables.  Honestly, I have been to dozens of Vietnamese restaurants and NEVER been offered 3 small leaves of basil and 2 micro-planed slices of jalapeno.  The bean sprouts were wanting although not to that extent.To be fair, the remainder of the cooked food, rice dishes and appetizers were acceptable.The inability of a Pho restaurant to make a correct broth is inexcusable.  Cost cutting? Stick with Pho Che nearby, at least they continually get the soup right.","This place recently opened up in Bayside and seems to be a favorite amongst the locals. Flavorful pho, decent portion sizes, and cleanly restaurant. What more can you ask for? Prices were fairly reasonable and they had plenty of seating. Noticed that some of the waitstaff wasn't as attentive because they were too busy texting.","Normally, I wouldn't write up a review of a place on the same day that I had gone to the establishment, but my experience here was so awful, I just couldn't wait. (Also, as an aside, I just realized that this would be my 700th review, and it's a shame that it's going to be a pretty bad one).My mother, myself, and my boyfriend came in at around 7PM earlier tonight, and the place was packed, which we took as a good sign. Looked like there weren't any tables available, so when the hostess asked how big our party, we told her, and then... she disappeared. Didn't mention that there would be a wait, or how long the wait would be, etc. We ended up speaking to another staff member, who honestly would've made a better hostess, who did put us down on a waitlist and then shortly afterwards, got us seated.Our server comes by not long after and we place our order. The bf ended up getting a grilled pork with rice dish, my mom got one of their phos, and I ordered their Chinese broccoli dish. The bf and I also ordered some drinks, and then our server went away to put in our order. About five minutes later, she comes back to tell us that one of the drinks weren't available, which should've been a sign for what was to come.The bf's food comes first, and I told him to go ahead and start eating. Then, my mom's dish comes out, and she goes ahead and starts eating as well. I figured my dish was just going to take longer, so I waited. And waited. By now, both my bf and my mother have finished their meals, so I've waited about 30 minutes at this point. Oh, and at this time was when our drinks came in, too. Finally, we flag down our server, and we tell her that my food had never come. She goes to check with the kitchen, comes back, and tells me that they didn't have my dish anymore and if I wanted to order something else. I'm pretty livid at this point. She never came by before to mention that my dish was out, which makes me think she had never put it in. She had also never once come by our table to ask how our meal was, to refill our water glasses, etc. I had completely lost my appetite at this point and wanted to just leave, so I just asked for the check. I made sure that my item wasn't on the bill, and at least that was correct. I figured this would be the end of the snafus for the night.But of course, somehow, this place seemed to have one more disappointment hidden away up its sleeve because when we got our check back, I had received somebody else's card and receipt. Basically, everything you could imagine going wrong by dining out at a restaurant went wrong tonight.I get that this place is new and the kitchen and FOH staff clearly doesn't have its shit together, but the horrible service we had received here largely overshadowed the quality of the meal. The only thing I had managed to try was their soda with egg yolk and condensed milk, and that was okay, but honestly, I never want to come back here again after tonight. Caveat emptor.","Saw a new pho place had opened up near me so I had to try it out! This place is pretty spacious and could fit a large party if need be (10+). The food was good, it wasn't really special but still delicious. The portions are also kinda small so the 2 of us ordered 4 different things and took only a little to go. We ordered:Tom Yum Soup - very delicious, the pineapple chunks mixed well with the soup. I just wished they peeled the prawns that are in the soupShrimp rice vermacelli - shrimp was grilled and seasoned well but they only gave us 4.5 shrimps for this ~$15 dishChinese broccoli with garlic - as expected, was a little too sweet thoughShrimp fried rice - just like any other fried rice, big shrimp pieces though!As for the service, it was okay. The waiters/ waitresses didn't really understand us sometimes.","I was SO excited to try Pho Grand after having gone to the one in Chinatown for quite some time. The food here is average at best and the service needs a little work.We went in and waited to be greeted by a hostess, anybody really, but no one paid us any mind. When a wait staff finally came around, we told him we were a party of 4 and was told that he'd be right with us. Then, the lady at the front noticed us waiting and asked if we had put down a name, which the guy before failed to take. She went on to take out name down but in the meantime sat a party of 8 who came in after us. The mishap was quite annoying, especially since we now had to wait. Nonetheless, I wouldn't have even minded that if the food was exceptional, but it wasn't. The broth to the pho lacked the deep rich beef flavor you'd expect from Pho, the crispy egg rolls were under done with some of the rice paper were still a bit sticky on the inside. The pork in the bahn mi were pounded out so thin that you couldn't taste the pork itself and was missing the mouth feel of having charred  meat in a sandwich. I was also upset that they didn't even use a proper baguette, where it's super flaky and crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Instead, they had the bahn mi on an Italian hero. The pork had no chance with a bread like that! I was really excited to have a Pho Grand so nearby, where I didn't have to travel out to Flushing or Chinatown... but I guess the trek out for good pho continues.","The best part of the pho is a good soup. Pho Grand's soup is just okay, it doesn't have a depth of flavor. They also are pretty skimpy with the beansprouts for two orders of pho. The restaurant is clean and neat. For the price I don't think I would come back.",Pho Grand Bayside
310,"Talk about being overhyped. Large comfy cafe for loungin and or grabbing some joe while working on homework. I didn't come to lounge though but to try their specialty items that I constantly see on IG. The ice cream shake machine was out of commission and they literary had no pastries. Also, they serve hot food but the menu is no where to be seem. Lastly, way too pricey. Over 6 dollars for a small iced matcha? Wtf? I'm good.","Every time I come the temperature remains the same all year round. I just think it's ridiculous that they keep the temperature at 67 degrees. I feel bad for the employees and almost tempted to call 311 because those are cruel working conditions.  I was there while it was snowing outside and they kept the back door open. Allowing the cold wind to constantly be blowing inside. Everyone studying inside was fully dressed with their winter jackets, scarves and hats on. I just don't understand how a place allows their customers and own staff suffer in that kind of environment.","Quality of espresso drinks are definitely there. The prices also show for this. They have a bakery section (the maple donut is to die for) and overpriced soft serve (black sesame) ice cream. If you come to study bring a thick sweater at all times, no matter what season it is. They use the freezing cold temperature ploy so that customers won't stay long (an employee told me this herself lol).","Absolutely delicious cappuccino.All the drinks come with a double shot so it's actually a better deal than that big coffee store.Have a comfy couch in back, good music and WiFi.I typically come in the morning and there's just a few people in and out but I stopped by one afternoon on my way home and it was packed!Tons of students on laptops drinking coffee and doing homework. They also have some fantastic baked in house croissants etc.",A little pricey but absolutely delicious cappuccino.All the drinks come with a double shot so it's actually a better deal than that big coffee store.,"Ambiance: 5/5Service: 4/5Coffee: 2/5Interior of the shop is really cute with a lot of tables for sitting/working/chatting but it was crowded on a Sunday afternoon when I went so it was impossible to find seats for our group of 4. Got an iced americano to go but because it's so busy, it took some time to actually get it. I was unpleasantly surprised by how bad the coffee tasted. The worst coffee I've had to date. It tasted off and had this super sour note. Maybe the other stuff is better though. I give them the benefit of the doubt.",White Noise Coffee Co
311,"The food was ok, but this place was dirty. I can see why it got a C grade. There was a dead bug in our peanuts. When we mentioned it to the staff, they simply gave us a new bowl of peanuts and joked that this one had no bugs in it. We ordered several dishes. One of them, the sticky rice and crab, took so long to come out that we were just sitting around bored for a very long time. It took so long that we tried to cancel the order. The staff kept telling us it would be out in a few more minutes and ignored our request to cancel it. After almost 40 minutes of just sitting there waiting, the dish arrived. It was very bland. Definitely not worth the price and very long wait.","When you're in Flushing it can be overwhelming  deciding where to eat. For me I don't want to eat at a touristy place. I want authentic and so I really look at the reviews especially because this place doesn't have a website. It was cold out and were walking briskly to get here. We spotted it ran across the street but I stopped before we walked in and said they have a B grade! I quickly look up what the violations were. Cold and hungry I was willing to take a risk. I also hoped that maybe they've fixed them since their last inspection which was in July. It was busy as you would expect on a Friday night but there was no wait. I'm assuming it's because as we experienced the service is fast. We were seated and brought over some tea and nuts. The waiter wasn't friendly but not rude either. We knew we wanted seafood so that made it easy to narrow it down with all the options they have. We skipped appetizers. My friend ordered the Jumbo Hong Kong Shrimp and myself the Jumbo Shrimp with Walnuts and mayonnaise sauce which I've had elsewhere. We also ordered a side of Young Chow fried rice( included egg, ham, shrimp, scallions).While we waited for our food we wanted wine. I guess it's a Flushing thing because they only serve wine by the bottle and we didnt want beer again so no dranks for us. In an eye dream of jeannie head nod our food came. At first glance I knew I wasn't going to finish it all. The portions are big. To make this simple the food is good and solid. Both shrimp dishes were fried but not greasy. The mayo sauce wasn't too sweet. The atmosphere had good vibes. We didn't feel out of place. The place was clean. When I'm back in the area I'd come back and try something a little more adventurous.The 3 stars is because of the violations and no wine by the glass. Oh yeah don't drive to Flushing if you don't have to. Parking is horrible.","I had the sizzling black pepper beef for dinner. The flavor was excellent, and the meat tender, but the presentation could use some work. First of all, the food is supposed to be still sizzling on the hot plate when they serve the dish (many restaurants bring the dish on a separate plate along with an empty hot plate, and pour the contents over the hot plate in front of you). Here, there was no sizzling at all, and the places where the meat touched the plate weren't even charred. Additionally, the meat was in large chunks which had to be cut with a knife, which I found unusually for a Chinese restaurant.Still, I will give it a decent rating as the food was delicious.3.5 stars","I went in solo, but it was packed with families who are likely local to the area, which I believe is a good sign. And was I right?! (Yes!) I had the crab + sticky rice, and the pork chops. The crab + sticky rice meal was good, but not necessarily my cup of tea. Definitely worth a try at least once in your life. The pork chops were amazing. I would recommend this place to friends and family, and I would definitely come back in the future anytime I'm in the area.","I've been to Imperial Palace a few times for lunch on a weekend. As a certified ABC who knows good canto food, imperial palace is solid! The C rating in the front may scare you, but we've never gotten sick or anything, or saw anything gross in the restaurant or dishes lol. The less you know... #blissfullyignorantToday we (group of 8) ordered a bunch of lunch specials and also the fried crab with sticky rice and fried lobster. Everything was delicious! The fried lobster was battered just right; the inside meat was still juicy. Got a few mouthfuls of yummy lobster meat. Sticky rice was too delicious, beware... my husband had to stand up because he was too full lol. Other notable dishes: salty fish chicken eggplant casserole, sautéed chinese broccoli, flounder filet with snap peas, sweet and sour pork (ging doh qwuk). Will return when we're craving Cantonese food, especially with the closing of Canton Gourmet :( Really good fried seafood and lunch specials from $7 and up. Nice quick waiters who always changed our plates.","This is probably my favorite Chinese restaurant in the city...NY...US? The crab sticky rice dish is a MUST!!!! Which you can also get with lobsta, but I'm all about, all about, all about that crab - no lobsta!In addition to ordering the above, we usually order wonton soup, snow pea leaves, steamed whole fish, and pork chops - always mm mm good! They have that delicious food consistency on point! The service is a wittle rough around the edges, but what do you expect? You're at a Chinese restaurant in Flushing.",Imperial Palace
312,"I don't know why people are hyping this place up. One of the worst Afghan restaurants I have been to, even worse than the cheap spot in Fresh Meadows. Kababs are super dry, no flavor, especially the Chicken Tikka Kabab. I can't believe this restaurant is still in business. Never going back.",This place is decent. The meat is seasoned well. But the portions were a bit off. So much rice and so little meat. Maybe I am just not use to the way it is set up. But something different to try in flushing aside from Asian food.,"If I could give this place no stars I would. My fiancé and I went here last night and we regret it so much. We ordered the salad shirazi  , the beef tikka, and lamb tikka. Let's start with the salad we asked for them to add feta cheese to it as it stated you could. When the salad came out the cheese was in a block and wasn't even spread throughout the salad, pretty sure it wasn't even feta cheese. The salad itself was so bland. The beef and lamb tikka were okay, there's way more rice on the plate than there is meat. Definitely not worth the price. As for service , the waiters were pushy and kept coming to our table every 5 minutes which we found to be rather annoying as we are trying to enjoy a meal. Definitely don't recommend.","Delicious food, the lamb kababs explode with flavor in your mouth.  Get it with brown rice topped with raisins and carrots, and your in business.  Also you can ask for complementary roasted tomatoes, they come warm on the outside and juicy on the inside, be sure to wait a bit before you bite into it or you may be burned.  Service is great and ambiance is nice too.Kabul Kabob is a family favorite, drop by and see for yourself!","Ever crave halal food but don't feel like eating on the streets, or in your car? Or perhaps you're looking for the same cuisine but with higher quality? Food: This is the spot! The rice is so fragrant with the cardamom and spices. And the meats are so juicy and tender. I loved the salad together with the meats and rice. Their chili sauces and white sauces tasted fantastic with everything too. Writing this review kinda has me wanting to go back. Drooling.The only downside was that I'd realized how much MSG they use in their food immediately after walking out. I get body ache reactions and devouring the entire plate of food did just that. But what can ya do, it was really good. Would I go back? Probably yes. Food- 8.5/10Ambience: 7/10 It's a clean spot. But definitely not pretty or classy by any means. Just your average mom and pop type feel restaurant with yellow *non-fluorescent lighting. (fluorescent lighting is a nono)Verdict: if your girlfriend said she wanted a sit down restaurant but your budget is Halal Guys, take her here.","I came here with a party of 6 because we were all craving kebabs and we all left very FULL. The portions are huge and the meat is cooked so perfectly. The chicken is tender and not overcooked or undercooked. The lamb and beef are both great but I always prefer the lamb because it's more flavorful and has a much better texture. Beware of the rice as it is really addicting and will make you full the fastest. The best part is always the white sauce (the green sauce is good too if you're into a little spicy). The lamb chops didn't amaze me too much as I've had much better lamb chops at so many other places so I'd take a pass on those.Other than the food, the service and atmosphere are great. The food is decently priced too.",Kabul Kabab House
313,"A second review- showed up today (a saturday) maybe at like around 2, right after crew practice. It was a little more crowded on this day, but I was still able to get a seat at the table. I tried one new item this time, and while it was good, I think I'll try something else next time. It was the chicken curry. One suggestion I might make is that they should consider using boneless meat instead of the bone stuff, since my pieces of chicken hardly had any meat on them. Still, using bone in pieces of meat is the asian way, so I'm not sure this will change in the near future.The spice levels here are kind of odd actually. I believe the color of the item name is supposed to correlate with the heat level (green: not spicy, yellow: medium, orange: very spicy). The problem is that some of the items with the orange label aren't spicy at all, like the curry chicken. An order of one item costs $10.60 (kind of a strange price), in case you were wondering. I think I'm gonna start getting stuff to go from here more often. Remember, cash only...",Tried them again and if your not thai you get smallest amount they can serve you. Why doesn't the owner take responsibility.,"Why is it that everytime I come here they give a non Thai person less food of everything ,even rice (white rice) and a Thai person so much more... why ??? I have been in between two Thai peoples and seen how much they get and how much i do...I come here often lunch and dinner ... please management don't be like this. Correct your staff! Don't be racist !!!!  Your food is good but why promote racism yeh","Wow this place is the real deal. It's a little bit difficult to get to if you're in manhattan, but i think it's definitely worth the visit, especially if you have some other business in queens. We arrived at maybe 1:45, and it was surprisingly not that crowded- there was still a table left. You order up at the front however, so we didn't wind up tipping here. There are a ton of good looking things for selection. The standard order here is $9.00 for a plate of rice and two sides, or $9.50 for a plate of rice and three sides. For my sides, I got the ground pork, the garlic pork, and the fish stew/curry. I also got an iced thai coffee, and the 2 pork ball skewers for $5.Well, they certainly weren't kidding with the spiciness of the fish stew. It doesn't start off too bad, but it gets super hot as you keep eating it. I actually wasn't wild about the taste, but this is probably the first sufficiently spicy thing I've eaten since coming to America (aside from eating ghost pepper hot sauce straight from the bottle). The ground pork has slight spice, though very nice overall. I thought the garlic pork was great, as were the pork balls. The iced coffee was not as sweet as your standard thai iced tea, which I thought was nice. Overall, I can't speak highly enough of the food here, and am looking forward to going again.","I have been saying that I am going to try Khao Kang for so long and I finally made it a visit. In fact, it was so delicious I visited twice the past two weeks and I don't usually eat at the same place multiple times a month. Khao Kang is like a Thai version of those 5$ pick three places in Manhattan Chinatown and food courts in Flushing. I love their first dish which is pork. At Khao Kang, you can pick 2 or 3 Thai dishes over rice. When they say it's spicy, they really do mean its SPICY. I love spicy food and I could not handle it. It burns in the throat and feels like fire in your mouth. I learned to only get one spicy item each meal here. Even so, their food is delicious. They have a lot of seating and have self serve water, the staff is also very kind and welcoming. Their Longan drink was a bit weird but tasted alright. Not something I really like. However, their Thai Tea was superb and I would definitely recommend it.tl;dr - try one spicy item at a time, it's really spicy if you get three! Thai ice tea is super good. usually, there is a lot of paid parking around, 2/3 quarters will get you through your meal.","THE BEST THAI FOOD EVER!!! I'm originally from Bangkok and I confidently say that this place is better than a lot of places in Thailand. All of dishes they make is southern style which has strong flavor and spicy. I usually go there when I craving Thai food. The price is very affordable for 3 items. Very friendly service. Cash only. I wish I would've taken more photos but when I get my food, I just can't wait to eat it! 5 stars and highly recommend if you love Thai food.",Khao Kang
314,I ordered the signature Lanzhou beef noodle. The noodles were made fresh and the broth was soft. I added spice and vinegar which made it more tasty. I gave it three star bc I couldn't find anything that made this place stand out from the other Lanzhou beef noodle spots in flushing.,great!have twice time to have noodles hereif i come american agaign i will come back,This place is meh. Stopped by for spicy beef noodle. Got seated immediately but this place was not what I was expecting. The broth wasn't very flavorful. It tasted like warm water with a bit of flavor. It wasn't even spicy. I wondered if I got the wrong bowl of noodles for a minute because it was so far from what I was expecting and the picture on their menu. Also ordered the fungus and the chicken salad. Everything was just meh or below average. My water cup was also very dirty.I wouldn't recommend this place and I probably wouldn't go back.,"LanZhou Beef Noodle has been a Far-West-Flung icon of Chinese signature bow noodle soup all over the world. This shop under the name of Dunhuang Beef Soups place, whenever you have $20 bucks in your pocket or you may order $23 for a lamb stew dish, this neat little clean place is actually suits for people in all ranks.In this afternoon we two spent $23 dollars (with tips), ordered a chilly threaded chicken cold noodles, and a set menu, which consisted of a tin of Chinese traditional herbal drink, a side spicy cabbage dish, and beef in clear broth noodle soup.Everything we ordered were delicious in decent portions, the long starched  noodles were in good chewy way and service was attentive .Obviously we would like to go back if we feel like something simple or maybe in a mood for a heavy meal dish.",best everlike this nooldes so muchthis is gonna be my little kitchenprice is okayservice is fine,Price I like it Food I like it tooI tried many places in the state to compare the lamian I had in western China. This one comes the closest. The chewy noodle and home made hot sauce set this dish apart from all the nock offs around nyc and other state. If you come to nyc you have to travel to flushing to have this noodle. You will thank me for it. Me and my partner had two original noodle and the bill came out to be less then 20 dollars. We were full. The service is chill and layback. I will be eating this noodle everything I visit nyc.,Dunhuang Lanzhou Beef Noodle
315,"Get ready to get handsy at hot n juicy! Let's start off with saying the location is probably its biggest downfall. It's in the back of a slew of Asian restaurants in a small building in the middle of flushing. You see Asian people stumbling by to go to the elevators or the bathroom or what have you.With that said, what a gem! I always get the drool- hot n juicy medium spice with Cajun calamari. Medium spice seems to be a good balance of spice and flavor for someone who eats Asian spice. I've gone a handful of times and when it's really good it's top notch, hands down 5 stars. The first time I went the waitress was telling us the crawfish are fresh/live prior to serving, which is a plus.If I can, I would give hot n juicy 4.5 stars cause their sauce is to die for BUT I do have to say, it can be inconsistent. Ive had it too salty, too spicy--even the Cajun seasoning on the calamari has been inconsistent whether there wasn't enough seasoning or too much. It's just a bummer when it happens but it doesn't really stop me from going back.","Mostly won't return. Taste is fine so is service ... but ...Dined on a Friday evening at around 6:30, it's empty. I know it's the way ... but I really don't like to see and use styrofoam thing, bad for the environment!!We have the Drool under the experience with Hot n Spicy medium. (4 seasonings are Louisiana, Juicy Cajun, Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper and Hot n Juicy. Spicy levels are baby spice, mild, medium, spicy and extra spicy.) You eat with your hands, no gloves provided - so if you've just done your nails, think twice.It has two entrances, one on Prince Street and one on 37th Avenue. Parking isn't easy: street parking, lot parking and garage parking. No reservation and they ask to see ID when we pay with credit card, under $100, come on, really?",Not as good as I expected it to be....the menu isn't as broad as I expected..I went for the shrimp po boy  & Cajun calamari,Loved the food in short. Not a pretentious person place. You order seafood by the pound and you gobble it down with your hands: The hot and juicy sauce is sweet and spicy just the right combo. most times the have fresh crawfish which is awesome. I really enjoy this place! It's tucked away inside of a mall so don't give up,"Wanted some seafood and a beer, my partner stumbled upon this place in Flushing. I had never even heard of this place and it almost didn't sound like something you would find in Flushing. We were the first ones there and our server, Joel, was extremely sweet. He explained the happy hour special, the food special and the restaurant it self. I ordered a Crawfish Po Boy which came with Cajun fries and a soda. My partner ordered the catfish basket with fries. It was great. The fry on the catfish was really nice and I would get the po boy with that next time. Crawfish fried wasn't anything too special. Joel made the experience. He was attentive, had a great attitude, and just an overall sweet server. Would definitely recommend for a group of friends who want seafood and drink specials!","Even after visiting New Orleans, this is still my favorite crawfish place. I absolutely love that they provide you with a plastic bib and gloves because you get very hands-on when eating crawfish. The gloves don't entirely prevent your hands from getting dirty, but they definitely protect your hands from the worst of it. They even have the table protected with a plastic sheet so don't be afraid to get messy. I got so eager to get ready in my new gear that I forgot to take photos.I usually go for 2lbs of crawfish ($15/lb) so I can get a free corn and potato. But corn and potato are both quite cheap to add into your boil if you don't wanna spend so much on crawfish. This time I got 1lb crawfish in the Juicy Cajun flavor, medium spicy. The sauce is yummy: not too thick and not too watery. The corn and potato marinated in the sauce is delicious.We also got a fried catfish basket to share. The catfish was very light and almost fluffy on the inside with a nice crisp exterior. It came with a basket of Cajun fries which were also nicely seasoned.",Hot N Juicy Crawfish
316,"came here for the crepe cake dessert. the food was regular, tasted pretty good. the drinks were my favorite part! the pink drink reminded me of my trip to thailand. nothing worth mentioning over entrees. so, i wanted to come here for the crepe cake. i told myself if the thai crepe cake was sold out, we'd get the rainbow one instead. i read some reviews that it tends to be sold out for dinner sometimes, not this particular time. it was early dinner hours, maybe 5pm. when i ordered it, she said ""okay! -wait let me check if we have any."" I looked over and saw her pull it out of the fridge in the front, a cake half gone and covered with plastic wrap. honestly, it looked old. however, i knew that cake can last in the fridge for maybe a couple of days so... if they serve it, it must still be able for consumption right?wrong! it tasted old. it had no flavor! it tasted like a bite of fluffiness with no flavor. since i was so excited i happily ate it but then after a few bites i started to realize i was getting no thai tea flavor or no sweet cream taste. we tasted nothing. the sauce on top masked the lack of taste but it can only do so much. i do not recommend at all, unless it's fresh and just made. or maybe we got a bad slice. who knows. the thai iced tea ice cream was decent tho.pretty disappointed. maybe will try a crepe cake again.","I was looking for a cool dessert place on Yelp and I came across Dek Sen. I saw the photos and videos and it looked really cool! Then we get there and it is a tiny hole in the wall. And as you walk in you just feel a little grimy. But again the photos and videos look amazing so I give it a shot. I ordered the.          It comes out on a hot skillet. The presentation is nice as they pour a chocolate sauce I'm guessing on the skillet to make a boiling effect. Then you dig in.  Sadly it's just a few pieces of puff pastry, one scoop of vanilla ice cream and a dollop of whip cream. That's it. I was unimpressed. Long story short I will not be going back. The restaurant has a dirty feel and the dessert was forgettable.",Very authentic thai noodle street food style. Tom yum noodle is to die for. Cash only.,"this place is amazing. really wanted to come here because of all the pretty and enticing dessert photos. we did not try any dessert because we were way too full. we got the waitress recommended crispy shrimp pad thai, and satay skewer appetizer, and a thai iced tea. the crispy shrimp pad thai is a nice little twist to your regular pad thai. rahter than rice noodles, the shrimp noodle-less pad thai is sat on top of fried crispy wonton skins, so basically an asian nachos with the most delicious pad thai fixins you could imagine with 4 decently sized juicy shrimpthe skewers were well marinated, and juicy. you could see it was perfectly charred (you could see the salty sweet glaze had the slightest burn, yum!)it was also our first meal of the day so maybe that's why we were stuffed but we had no room for dessert after that. we'll definitely have to come back! i want to try everyhting on the menu.","The only thing I can comment on here is the tom yum noodle soup, because everytime I come, it's the only thing I order. I've been here over a handful of times, hosted a baby shower here and everytime it's the tom yum noodle soup. I've never had tom yum soup quite like this. Throw in some rice noodles and we're talking perfection. The spice will kick your butt, but it's so worth the sweat. Just writing this review has me drooling and dreaming of a nice big bowl of this. If you love tom yum soup, you HAVE to try this. You won't anything like this, anywhere else. The staff here is extremely friendly. Service is quick, restaurant is tiny so it's an eat and go kind of place. You will not be disappointed, I guarantee it.","The outside of the restaurant is kind of misleading and you don't realize how small it is until you come in.  It has a rough, homey and eclectic charm.  The tables and chairs don't quite match, and the utensils and plates have seen better days.  Nevertheless, it's a cute restaurant.We came very close to closing time (an hour before) and we were lucky to have been seated.  And even though our intent was to go just for desserts, we ended up ordering a couple of entrees and appetizer along with dessert.  We ordered the Moo Ping Brooklyn (pork skewers), Beef See Euw and Salty Fish Fried Rice.  The fried rice was very good and only had a subtle fish flavor.  I liked that it was topped with a runny fried egg.  The beef see euw was great and had more kick than I was expecting.  Delicious nonetheless.  My favorite dish were the pork skewers.  They were exceptional and grilled to perfection. By the time we ordered desserts it was 15 minutes before closing and they had run out of some items on the menu.  Luckily, they still had the milo sizzling roti and the chocolate lava cake. The desserts were amazing.  Both have ice cream as a component in the dish and the wait staff will ask you to choose the ice cream flavor.  We decided to go with plain vanilla, but they also offer green matcha and Thai tea flavors for ice cream.  The lava cake was delicious and not overly sweet.  And the milo sizzling roti was out of this world delicious.  I think it's my new favorite dessert right now.  The dessert consists of scoops of ice cream on top of fried dough, surrounded by mini marshmallows and corn flakes and topped off with whip cream.  It looks amazing when it comes to your table, but it gets even better as the waitress drizzles Milo syrup on top.  The whole thing sizzles and smokes--it's absolutely fantastic. A big thank you to the staff for not rushing us out as we were the last diners left in the restaurant that night.  We loved this place and will definitely be back.",Dek Sen
317,"Ordered From Here Last Night. I Guess It Was Late Or The Kitchen Was Closing, HoweverThe Food Wasn't That Tasty At All. Maybe It's Different Type Of Mexican Restaurant Or Whatever, But I Didn't Enjoy What I Ordered.Very Nice Inside Restaurant. Cozy & Intimate Décor.Maybe I Will Try Again In The Future, But With Some Many Mexican Cuisine Restaurant In My Bookmarks; It Won't Be Anytime Soon.","Food is excellent, as is the service.There was a little confusion with billing due to splitting the bill, but the owner corrected it all and is a very lovely.I would definately go back.","First, they charge you an additional 3% to pay by credit card. It is never mentioned until you get the bill and the menu has the cash prices. We had half cash and they still tried to charge us 3% for the portion that was cash. They gave us back that portion of the 3% and a free dessert after we complained but it is still wrong. The food was good and fresh. It is overpriced and the 3% makes it worse. We went on a Tuesday and they are understaffed. It has limited  Mexican but does have some tacos and other dishes. Octopus was excellent. Drinks were good but not very strong. Not sure if I would return, mostly because of the 3% up charge.","Went on a Saturday night. Sat down right away. Pretty small but food and service was great. Maybe it's because of the area but drinks were awfully pricey.It was kinda odd that they had a DJ there playing music, especially for such a small place. Do they expect people to dance? I don't get it. But it was too loud. Like we would have went somewhere else if we were looking for a bar/club scene. It was super difficult to talk and hear each other. We went there because I was there for a bday brunch a while back and the food was excellent, great staff overall good time. However, their Saturday night vibe was not what I was looking for.","Came here on a date with my husband (new parents!) There was no one else in the restaurant, but we were in between meal rushes. So the service was pretty great. We enjoyed the food - and the drinks! Everything was fresh and flavorful. I had the suadero tacos, which I'd definitely order again. The chips and salsa for the table were tasty as well. I get what people are saying about it being a bit pricey, but I don't agree. We were happy with the portion sizes - not enough for leftovers, just enough.","This place is a great find. Definitely 4 stars for the food. However, I feel that the entire restaurant is so overpriced that I would knock it down a star.Pros:+ Great dishes - the queso fundido is amazing. Definitely a great appetizer to share.+ Great drinks - I highly recommend the Picosito. It's a jalapeño cucumber margarita and is a perfect accompaniment on a hot summer day.Cons:+ Chocolate lava cake - While a great start, I would put this in the cons because there were several things that really needed to be improved. The glaze was described as passion fruit, but I am pretty sure there were just strawberries (kinda a disappointment after waiting for such a long time). The other part of this I think could be improved is the ice cream. It was overly frozen and had the texture of ice crystals. While this was an overall good attempt, it was not work the $13 menu price.- Limited parking - what else is new on Bell Blvd?- Generally overpriced for the quality. I would have been happy to spend $30 for my meal, but it was easily $45 (lacking the quality to warrant that mark-up).",Spanglish NYC
318,"Came here for some good congee on a cold day. Congee was good.  Pretty consistent with all of the franchise-like restaurant establishments in New York City named something ending in ""Wong"", ""Wang"". These serve your usual congee, noodles and rice dishes of all kinds.Buy each of these types of restaurants also serve rice rolls (or Cheung Fun) with some sort of filling inside, usually pork, beef, shrimp or dried shrimp.Congee was good... But the shrimp rice rolls was a disaster. It came out looking like a blob of brains. Quite literally ugly and unappetizing. The rice roll was very thick and there was no art or pride in the way it was rolled. It was just a blob of stuff.I would imagine they have the good congee, rice and noodle dishes, but certainly stay away from the rice rolls.","The soup dumplings we're not the best I've had. A bit over priced, but overall, good food. Extensive menu with lots of dishes to choose from.","I have no idea how this place even have over 2 stars on Yelp, this place is trash.When I went here, it looked like a run down restaurant. The dining area wasn't visible and they had no host so it's a little confusing at first whether you can dine in or only order to-go. The server was in the dining area too so you have to actually go deeper inside to receive any service. The first thing you see when you get inside is the kitchen, and some fridges. At the right of the door is where you can order to-go. At the left side, they had a desk with a bunch of office supplies and some fruits or maybe veggies. The dining area is at the left side but you wouldn't realize it because it is a little hidden and there was an old man watching something on his tablet while peeling something right beside the said desk.When I got seated, I asked for water but the server insisted on just settling with their hot tea. The server was quite old and barely spoke English so it was a little difficult to communicate. I ordered the three meat and rice combo since it was the most reviewed one and it looked good in the pictures. When I got my plate, it actually looked promising. But the moment I took my first bite, I've never wanted to just walk out of a restaurant so bad in my entire life. It was terrible. The rice was cold and so were the meat. I felt like I was getting fed some left over food. I told the server about it, and he took my plate. I can almost guarantee everyone that they just microwaved it. It was the same plate, and it looked untouch. Except this time, it was warm. At that point, I already lost my appetite and just wanted to leave, but I never like to waste food. I finished my plate, paid, and left.I'm never going back to this place. I absolutely do not recommend going here either, you wouldn't know if you're getting fresh food or not. This place should be put under review.","Food is delicious! And staff super friendly, if you want authentic Chinese food, go here. shrimp noodles so good!I took away one star because of the cleanliness,z the bathroom is broken down and filthy, I guess use the bathroom somewhere else lol","This is a super authentic Cantonese restaurant. It is exactly like the old school ones you would find in the Manhattan Chinatown. I have had many of their items here - soy sauce chicken, roast pork, roast duck, beef with broccoli, Peking pork chops, beef chow fun, and more. They have all been consistently good quality. The only thing that might turn some people off is that the place is kind of old and run down. It does not take away from the quality though.","We order congee, wonton noodle and roasted meats here on a regular basis. Food is consistently good and price is good also. Sometimes hard to communicate on the phone to place order if you do not speak Chinese",Shun Wang Restaurant
319,"This place was my bread n butter for a while.  I'd go for the white fish.  You gotta get it from the back, not from the front.  Tell the chica not to put too much oil.  Parking is a nightmare.  The surrounding neighborhood is a horror show.  My buddy munds once got food poisoning from a fuzzy tomato, a disaster.  I never had a problem.  The line is unbearable unless you got a raid jacket and can go to the side and order from Estanita.  Grab a seat and watch some Telemundo.","I have frequented this establishment many times because as others have said the food was good in the past. My one star is due to their poor customer service skills. Do not expect to be treated with respect by the cashier.I ordered food for pickup on 07/01/19, which was Combo # 3 for $38. A relative picked it up in my place. The cashier told my relative that the cost of the food was $38. There was an error on my part for not giving the right information HOWEVER what the cashier proceeded to do is unacceptable. In a frustrated manner he went to look for a 'menu' to give to my relative. He shoved it in his face and told him to check the prices himself. As someone who has ordered food from this restaurant an infinite amount of times I would expect at the very least a modicum of respect. I have also recommended this establishment to anyone that lives in the area.  I don't care how busy the place is- there is no reason to talk down to a patron. This behavior is bad for business.The sub par customer service skills that the workers exhibit along with the food [that has become mediocre at best] is not worth it.",Everyone that works here is racist towards black women. Especially the bald man that hovers over your food while you're checking out... I live on the same block I will never eat from here again .,Tried this place for the first time. So glad I did. Just what I needed after a long days work. The beans are flavorful alone. The same for the rice and stew chicken. The passion fruit juice was so refreshing. Will be back,"I found this place by accident and it has changed my life since.I've always been a fan of Spanish food, it literally rocks my taste buds! You always get a lot of flood, packed with flavor and great quality.It's buffet style line up, so you pick what you want. I asked for the fried whole fish, rice and beans, beans on top, and Sweet plantain... ONLY 13$ with a drink! WOW! So much food, and it was so good. The food was good I went back the very next day for the same meal! (don't judge me)Seriously, try this place... and try the passion fruit juice. Beware of the LINE....... can be lengthy!",Not to happy. Doesn't taste bad but I grew up in the neighborhood so I taste the difference in the food.

320,Unresponsive management. Left note and emailed owner. No reply to either. Seems to have time to cyber bully reviewers however.,"Burgers are too thick and difficult to eat without much flavor. If you have to eat a burger with a fork and knife it's not really a burger anymore it's a slab of meat between some bread. Service was uninspiring also. P.S.

See salt and bone.",Nothing great here!  I had the Marilyn burger and it was a sloppy over priced mess with less than a hand full of potato chips.  Staff inattentive and spent more time outside visiting with each other than the customers.  No A/C and ceiling fans were worthless.  Loud music consisting of every other word being the N work.,"This may be the best burger in Long Island City.My first experience with this place was in the summer.  We came here in the thick of summer and it was so hot in there.I am not sure if the AC was broken or if there is no AC?!?!We each got a burger, different dressing and styles.They were both good.  We've been back since and gotten a different burger.I don't remember which burger I got, but I would say that they are all good based on the 3 burger sample I've had. LOL.The only negative I would say is that when I ask for certain sides, they have run out for the day. It's happened the two times I've been there.They also don't have fries, but that may be because of their craft of burgers or it may just get too hot with fries?We have not tried the beers, so can't attest to that.Overall, I know I'll be back and I would recommend this place.","EDIT (per response): I'm afraid I go there almost every week! I thought I expressed much of the goodness that comes from this place. I refrained from leaving a bad review along with a bunch of others at the time as I do like this place. Though, as a manager, you can be a bit more receptive to feedback whether it's late or not. After all, you're in charge of making this place look good here! I hope :)--------------------------------------Oh Baroness. You could easily argue that their basic burger is the best burger in the hood, if not the whole city. But I'm a relatively basic guy so feel free to explore the huge selection of burgers (and beer ofc!). I can say that Dixie and Priscilla are also decent burgers but can be too sweet for some as the sauce is strongly flavored along with the patty. Also, one common flaw across all their burgers is the outside of the buns which are very oily. Not sure if it's by design or from the gloves but I'd prefer it without much oil. I considered this place a solid 4 star but docked off a point due to one terrible experience. I believe it was on Memorial Day when there was one person working with a lot of crowd. He seemed to struggle but more importantly nearly all the customers were beyond frustrated. It took 15+ minutes just to get the server's attention and then a response: ""I'll be with you in ten minutes"". Sigh. I was also losing patience but in retrospect I don't blame the guy. I'd more so point the finger to whomever made the decision to have one person working on a national holiday. That sure was a disappointing experience but won't stop me from binging their burgers.","I came here on a Sunday evening with a party of 13. A few of my friends went to the bar (most of us are bartenders ourselves so we're well aware of what good customer service means) One of my friends asked the bartender to recommend a stout, to which he replied, ""well I'm not gonna pick a beer for you!"" Super rude! We received no kind of greeting whatsoever when we initially walked in (even though the place was dead and looked like they could've used the business) Overall, a short and unpleasant experience and I will not be returning.

321,"This had been a go to place for awhile, but it's gone down. This last tone was it. Disinterested servers who basically scoffed and got snarky because they decided that due to the rain(huh?) they'd end the lunchtime special 30 minutes early, and refuse to honor it, despite being there and being a regular. Doesn't help to have gotten a taste of good service and honorable people at another restaurant. We may be back. But nothing's worse than rude people who don't appreciate loyalty or good customers.","Although the food is OK everything else is not. It's carpeted which is an immediate dirt trap, it often needs to be vacuumed, usually dirty countertops, our server insisted on doing the cooking for us for some reason which really pissed me off. It is called I cook, not YOU cook.  Tehehhee. We even asked him not to and he still did. Then we got ignored. Nonetheless, nothing special about it, wouldn't go back.","This is definitely a very bad experience, no smile service, if that is called service. When we sat down, the seat was broken, and there were a lot of plates on the table. No one came to take the plate away. Every time we needed to stand up and wave, someone would come to serve. When we say that all things only need 1-2 components, but they are still the weight of our four people, we refuse, they do not accept?  We are going to eat what we don't need? Then tell me, if there is no food, there will be a fine? This is my friend's special purpose to call them over, empty the desktop! It's half empty! ! I won't come again, if my friends want to come, I will tell them about my experience! !","One of my favorite all you can eat hot pot places!The selections are amazing and there are many house specials you cannot find elsewhere.In terms of the soup base, some of them can be a tad bit salt so beware. I like their herbal and tomato the best. Tom Yum is a little more oily and spicer than I expected.I loved how they had a dozen selection of balls, veggies, etc. Many of the options are super traditional and cannot be found unless you go to a la carte hot pot locations.","We are relatively new to the hotpot craze. Until now, our only experience was one about two years ago, and it wasn't all that memorable. But we've been wanting to give it a try, so we checked out iCook. Our hesitation until now is that we are not big, big eaters. So an all you can eat thing is not our style. When we say that iCook has a lunch special, we jumped. It was not only affordable, but it helped limit our options, as the menu otherwise can be very overwhelming. We LOVED it. And, it's now become our latest craze. We now are at least doing lunch here once or twice a week.First of all, it's a great spot. And, the service is wonderful. We usually have Mike as our server. He's friendly and attentive, and now he knows our order. Actually, I think most of them do. But Mike seems to really be on the ball.The food is fresh, and they have a tremendous amount of sides and sauces that you can get.It's the perfect place for a taste of hotpot. The food is always good. If you love hotpot and you want a great place to get it, then iCook should be at the top of your list. They're also the only one we've found that offers a non-all you can eat option.","iCook is my go to hot pot spot because it's the closest to me in proximity. What I like about this place:1. Staff is very attentive 2. Orders come out quick 3. Sauce bar is always stocked4. Food is filling and most of the time, good.What I dislike about this place:1. Hostess can be dismissive2. The quality of the meats can sometimes switch up on you in between orders. You can have 2 great orders of fatty beef and then the third plate will come out looking like the meat's been in the freezer for weeks or something. (It also affects the taste)",iCook Buffet
322,"Am I missing something here? At the very most for $3 per slice, this slice is average. So what gives the 4.5 stars of 240 reviews?! Supremely average and tbh I would've still given 3 stars had it been $1-2. There was sufficient amount of sauce to cheese, nothing extra, not flavor not ingredient. The crust is neither stone fired, bubbly, nor innately distinctive whatsoever... but an average crunchy gluttony crust throughout with no char nor much flavor. But it was the right thickness and crunchy I'll give you that. But that's it. That's already going too much into it.Makes me think who's reviewing this spot.

Because it does hold such a prestigious title, the slices are a bit pricey. This is absolutely not a $1 slice establishment. You will have to walk a few more blocks for that. The pizza is always hot and the crust is crispy. If you're in New York, you must try it. Steps away from the train station.",Average cheese pizza. If you want any pizza with topping expect mushrooms from a can scooped onto a pre cooked cheese slice. Nahhhhh son,"Hands down the best pizza place in queens. The quality of there pizza is awesome. I have been Coming to margherita pizza shop since I was a kid.And the taste is still the best .from there pepperoni and chicken slices ,to there sausage and mushrooms slices. What great pizza, just enough cheese on it and just the right amount of grease on it.there pizza has separated themselves from the rest for years .And the competition is none .it is not the biggest restaurant but it has the best quality pizza. It is a landmark in jamaica queens. People come from all over to taste their famous slices .The restaurant is always a little crowded. But the atmosphere is peaceful. And if you want to sit down and eat the have some tables and chairs in the back.Most people take out or eat right there at the counter .so if you are in the jamaica queens area or on jamaica ave stop by and try some of there pizza","Hands down the best pizza in new York. I've been eating here since I was a little kid. I have tried pizza in many places. However,  the pizza at margarita is tops. If you want some amazing pizza, I urge you to give them a try. I promise you will not be disappointed.","So, this is hands down my favorite pizza place anywhere!I've been coming to Margherita's since the 80's. The recipe is exactly the same. Most of the people are the same as well. The current owner used to be an employee and bought the place. His daughter has been working there since the late 90's and she's still there. He's kept everything the same, including the decor. The only thing that's changed is the price, but that's okay...If you're from Queens you may know there used to be this big debate of Margherita's vs. Gaby's. Margherita's won...  I always thought they were better anyway. As for the interior, there's not much to say - it's green and white, long and narrow, the oven is smack dab in the middle, and there is limited seating behind the oven to the back of the pizzeria. In the summer, it can get really hot in here. Most people come here grab a slice and go. Current price of a plain slice is 3.25, you know - cheese only... So, run your pockets...lolAnd, this place is CASH ONLY. Never Forget. However, if you do there's a couple banks in walking distance - this is the Ave.",Margherita Pizza
323,It's so disgusting. Ask him for a little chili sauce. Give me a small dish and collect me three dollars.,I picked up my food and drove home and i opened my bag to this!? It's not even fully filled. Really disappointed that they charged me money for this.,How the f can they expect me to eat a burned rice with water?  Noo roong ji is supposed to be light brown as if the rice is toasted.  The bottom of rice was straight BURNED to BLACK ASHES.  The server woman who made me sit next to noisy seniors can screw herself too.  Soup and banchan were still good.,"My friend comes here all the time and she introduced it to me. It is a nice little restaurant somewhat by the corner of the block. I almost missed it which I don't know how. Just a little tip, there is a small parking area in front of the restaurant but there's also street parking around if the lot is full. The staffs are super friendly and constantly coming over to ask if we need anything and if we need any refills on the side dishes. There is a good selection of food options but a little pricey. They do have lunch special except on holidays and Sundays. The seafood noodles are really good and it is a good portion for the price. The soups in the hot stone as well as the rice. The  appetizers are really big and it is a great portion to share. The cheesy ricecakes is an appetizer that you should def try!Will go back again when I visit my friend","This place was excellent! Great friendly service, homey and the food was very good.  Banchan excellent, I could've made a meal from that alone .I had the dolsat bibimbap, the veggies could've used more flavoring, and I felt the hot sauce could've used a touch more sugar. Our seafood pancake was very good, but slightly undercooked.  We couldn't finish it so we took that home, when we reheated it in our air fryer is was great!!They constantly checked in to refill our glasses, our banchans and gave us very attentive service.  This place is open 24 hours, so perfect for late night after party food.  The only thing that was annoying was the tv screens w K-pop playing...not a fan lol.I would've liked to rate 4.5 stars, bc the service and the banchan was that good. I'd definitely come back here.","I was originally going to give them 4/5 stars but after my recent visit, I had to change it. I come here very frequently and every time I come here, I order the Galbi + Soondubu combination. They are usually good with the amount of meat that comes with it but today, it was far less. It was literally 6 pieces. From those 6 pieces, 1 had no meat. When I commented on the amount of galbi pieces that were given, the waiter's response was that that's how it usually is since it's a combination order. He added that they cook 2 rows of the galbi. 5 pieces of galbi in 2 rows?  I'm sure that is definitely not true. Their rice was undercooked as well. The stone pot they have their rice in was not even toasted on the bottom. It was just one disappointment after another.Other than that, their soondubu is good here so if you're just ordering the soup, I highly recommend it. Do not get the Galbi + Soondubu combination. I'm hoping that this was just a one time thing as it's my go to place.",SGD Tofu House
324,I live less than 5 minutes away. Food took more than an hour to be delivered. Ordered DLX nachos but instead of nacho chips got fried tortillas to go along with it. Disappointed. Tried to like this place twice. Don't see the hype.,"We used to order from here all the time until I found a bandaid in my burrito. They were super apologetic, but I'll never eat from here again.","I live nearby the restaurant, but It took over an hour and a half to deliver.... tacos were not as expected... not the worst tacos, but they are not good either... not buying from this place again... oh the sauces weren't good either.","Best street taco takeout hole in the wall. They do have seating inside, not the most luxurious but worth it for the delish food. I haven't had one item yet I didn't really enjoy off the menu. I typically order off of Grubhub for takeout from here. The Grubhub app explains each taco and its toppings where their menu does not. So if you are new to homemade taqueria I HIGHLY recommend checking grub hub first. Order from here you won't be disappointed","Best street taco takeout hole in the wall.

They serve up street style Mexican food that doesn't disappoint. The atmosphere is not the greatest but it's super easy to overlook when you try the food. I had three tacos and was full after the first two, but needed to try that third because they all just looked so good. If this place was a food truck in Williamsburg or at some food festival, they could easily sell their tacos for 8$ a pop, but this place is cheap! $2.50 I believe for a taco. I'm not sure why people are writing reviews about poor service and their experience. It's a quick bites, local & authentic spot. It's not meant to be a full service date restaurant. My pro-tip if your a local is ordering through grub hub just made my life SO easy. Ready in under 10 minutes.",Homemade Taqueria
325,"$7.95 for half quart size rice roll. What a rip off.  Will not go there again.  They use those smaller than quart size but bigger than half quart container.  And the rice roll is not even full, so this is equal to half quart. $7.95 is expensive for a rice roll with mixed sauce.  Will not go there again.  The rice roll is very hard and salty.8/11/19:Called 88 canteen today to verify price of the rice roll. And the guy said it's 3.95. Then it must be someone in the shop who is stealing money from customers cause someone also posted they paid 5.75 for one order  of rice roll from this shop.",This place has good foodBut totally rapes you on the prices of cold drinks. Price listed on wall is not correct.,"Rude racist assholes.I went ONCE and I waited on an empty line for 5-10 minutes while the cashiers stared at me, and just took the Asian customers BEHIND me (I was first in line) instead. Is it because I'm not Asian, that they think it's okay to treat me like I'm less than them? I was born here, been here all my life, but they looked at me like I was some sort of weird monster that didn't belong. When they finally served me, I asked for spaghetti with TOMATO sauce and I got meat sauce. Told them it's wrong, they said ""no, you said meat."" I said I asked for tomato. They said okay, and took it back. I got a new plate, still had meat sauce. I AGAIN pointed it out and then they finally fixed it. Moral: don't go here if you're not Asian","You've got to understand that this is primarily a bakery/cafe but it serves food on the side. I don't expect bakery food to be on the same level as HK restaurants that specialize at making actual dishes. However, their menu is HUGE and the dishes I ordered exceeded my expectations. I only wish they had printed copies of the menu instead of the size 12 font for their menu that's 3 feet away. Be prepared to squint!Milk tea was so creamy and sweet, most likely loaded with spoonfuls of sugar but that's to be expectedIndonesian fried rice was out of this world! I absolutely love when fried rice is fragrant and this one hit my nostrils from the moment I opened the takeout box. There was a decent amount of meat and seafood in it and a delicious fried egg on top. There were also a few pieces of beef which were AMAZING! I wish they had put a few more because they were so good. Braised pork over rice noodle was tasty as well. I loved how much sauce was in the dish, it was enough to completely drench my food in yummy goodness. The pork wasn't melt in your mouth but it still hit the spot. Both dishes were roughly $8 each and had generous portions. The cafe operates like any other so it's pay and go, so no tip! Delicious, quick and easy meal.","I love HK and Taiwanese breakfast and made sure to get some while I was visiting NY. Found 89 Canteen and made my way towards Flushing! The restaurant is easy to find but seating can be limited. Since they serve breakfast, the place is busy but people come and go pretty fast.This is my first time seeing condensed milk with peanut butter toast! I just had to have it! I don't eat bread at home so when I'm out, I gotta get it. I got that with the Breakfast A set and an iced milk tea. Nothing special, typical breakfast but it sure hits the spot. If I wasn't full, I want to try their noodles. Until next time!","Love this place. I come here for lunch often and always get there lunch specials. Most of their rice lunch specials come with a delicious cup of the soup of the day. Chicken curry rice is excellent. So if there fish fillet with tofu. There oven baked rice/noodle dishes are good too. So is there stir fried noodles. Actually.. everything is pretty solid. My wife really likes the flavor of there noodle soup and they go out of their way to make it spicier for her because she likes really high heat levels in her meals. Locally owned and operated place so the owner is always there with her workers in the morning and lunch shifts. Only thing preventing five stars is that they do get really really slow during lunch hours on weekends. Has been a while now and they haven't been able to solve that issue, which prevents me from ordering from them on weekend and holidays. Recap*Order lunch special rice dishes for daily soup.Stir fried noodles have good flavor.Weekends expect long wait and order ahead.Street metered parking available. Also free local parking available if you look around the block.",88 Canteen
326,"If you know, you know.For all the newbies out there, make sure you guys get a lot of green sauce.",Hidden gem!! It's a mixture between Chinese/Mexican food. This place has the best ribs and green sauce. I usually get the chicken and ribs combo with yellow rice and broccoli. Their ribs are so tender that they just slide off. I definitely recommend getting their green sauce because it literally goes with everything! The rice is so bomb. I always come out of this place with a food coma. They get pretty busy during lunch time but you can order ahead and they'll have your food ready. The only bad thing about this place is that they're located so far from where I live.,"Large portion 1/2 chicken with two sides & pita lunch special with soda ..Lacked flavor, tastes like chrarbroilGot the mAshed, didn't offer gravy, and mac n cheese which was bland.Employee smoking by front door and place could use a cleaning.","Chicken Lovers is a great place to eat if you're looking to get a solid meal that will make fill your appetite. This is one of the best bang for your buck places in the area. We ordered the whole chicken family meal with 3 sides.... the chicken is full of juicy flavor that will keep you wanting more and we had leftovers the following day! The green sauce.... Quality, and get a lot of it, because it is a game changer. For our sides, we got Mac n cheese which was my personal favorite, is delicious, broccoli which was also delicious and red potatoes which you can't go wrong with. Make sure to call ahead of time, this place is always busy, rightfully so. The staff is friendly, quick and attentive if you're in the mood for chicken, ribs or wings... look no further.","To all the chicken lovers out there ... You should go get some Chicken Lovers. This Chinese-Mexican chicken joint is cooking out some good old American BBQ chicken. First, the chicken is grilled to have the perfect balance of char and flavor. The white meat is juciy and tender. There's no special seasoning, just the basic salt and pepper. Next, you can order a combination of sides, ranging from steames broccoli, Mac&cheese, rice, potatos, and a few more. Finally, you will receive the secret ""green sauce"". This sauce is almost neon green, which casts some doubts on how it might taste. I am happy to report, it tasted amazing. The flavor is a combination of spicy avocado and mayo. Lastly,nthe portion is huge and the cost is reasonable! 1/2 a chicken with 2 sides is about 10$ and I can barely finish it in one sitting. This price is their lunch special and ran from 12-4p. (Highly recommended)It's no surprise this place is popular among the locals, because I can see myself coming here for lunch on a weekly basis as well.","My goodness does this place just have great and humble food. The chicken and the ribs are amazing, and the sides are even better. You can get yourself a hearty meal for about $10-11, and you may even end up leaving some for the next day. If you're planning on having a family meal it may end up even a little cheaper. I notice that people tend to either get rotisserie chicken or ribs(1/4 puns or 1/2 pound), but the last time i went there i actually decided to order the chicken wings and that was a hands-down phenomenal decision. These wings are awesome! The roasted potatoes, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese are all really good options, but if i had to choose the best option out of the three it would be the roasted red potatoes. GET THE GREEN SAUCE AND GET A LOT OF IT!One thing to keep in mind is that they have a set amount of food that they will make for the day. This means that if you get there later on in the day they may have run out of certain things. You can always call and order ahead of time because it gets quite busy at this place. It is usually a 25 minute wait to get your food. All in all this place is a really great choice if you're interested in some straightforward good food with no frills. The young lady at the register taking orders is also really sweet, and the rest of the people working there move quick.",Chicken Lovers

Super cool!The salsa and chips are good, a standard. I got the quesadilla with chicken and I liked that they used breast meat as opposed to some places that use rotisserie which ruins a quesadilla for me. My friend got a chicken dish that came with really good fries and my other friend got the carnitas tacos which were good but small. All in all the prices are great and a good dining experience. My only complaint was that we were asked several times if we wanted a drink and felt judged because we kept saying no.","I am so conflicted about this review. I came here for a date night. I like the overall aesthetic it's cute warm and cozy. The food and drinks was a miss for me. My boyfriend and I initially started with margaritas which tasted salty? It was odd, there was salt in the bottom of our drinks and we could taste it every time we sipped our drinks it was unbearable and we had to send it back. Instead we got Coronas and sangria which was fair. My boyfriend ordered the churassco with yuca fries which he enjoyed. (I tried the fries it and it was really good.) My red snapper wasn't cooked all the way through because it was pan seared, which I do understand it can happen with fish, but it was kind of gross to see how undercooked it was. Our waitress was really nice though! Really nice and accommodating! Manager checked on us as well. Overall I liked the attentiveness or staff and the aesthetic.",Lunera Modern Mexican

There are two things on the menu, it's cash-only and the ahjumma will make you leave as soon as you're done paying.BUT their spicy beef bone soup is bomb & it's the best cure to a hangover, so would I come here again? yes.PSA: I really just want to emphasize that they're not the nicest people here. I warned you.","ABSOLUTELY adding this place to my go-to list in Flushing! This is a super casual, specialty spot where they only serve one dish - Beef Gukbab. So you know it has got to be gooood. Once you walk in, the waitress just gonna ask ""spicy or no spicy"".They have freshly made fried egg omelette, picked radish, jalapeno, and crispy seaweed for banchan. And it's UNLIMITED! Yes, they literally refill any banchan even before you ask for it. I can just have a bowl of rice with fried egg and seaweed and I'm set. JK you can't pass their Gukbab!!! The broth is so rich from all the stewed beef bone. And if you're like me I'd add a little bit of salt into it. There's plenty of beef and clear noodle inside. It's hard to explain but you can tell the noodle is freshly made cause it tastes so buttery. All dat for $14? SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!Oh and from reading the other reviews, it's true that the waitresses keep saying 'Scuse me Scuse me' every time they walk by even if no one is on their way lol","5 stars for the food and service.1. Fresh banchan- the waitresses are super attentive and constantly refilling your banchan 2. You walk in and they're already taking your order (you just decide between original or non-spicy) 3. The attentive Hispanic waitresses saying ""excuse me"" every time they walk out of the kitchen holding hot soup so no one gets hurt4. The egg made fresh and not pre-made5. The large quantity of dangmyun (glass noodles) cooked in the soup","Fourteen dollars gets you an unlimited supply of peppers, seaweed sheets, pickled radish, and freshly fried egg omelettes, along with your main entree of seolleongtang. Water is self-serve and you don't really have a choice of what to order-- only an option to adjust the spice level(I prefer a mild spice for that extra flavour). Parksanbal is great at making its one menu item. The meat has never been overcooked the many times that I've visited and flavours are consistent. The work and time that's put in shows in the soup. The portion is enough to fill you up, with a side of rice.I am a big fan of the omelette here. I've been to too many places that give you cold omelettes for banchan and these fluffy, piping hot eggs completely change the game.(Possibly?)

Which is reasonable, I'm not mad at that. What I am annoyed at though is that there was 4 adults and 2 children (9 months and a 3 year old). She really tried to play that 2 kids are gunna have their own plate. Which they didn't. A infant isn't going to eat the diners food and 3 year old just shared a plate because it's insane to give a 3 year old child their own plate. We didn't argue with the waitress, we assumed she really needed the tip. Never coming back lol","To me it's sad to see what this diner has come to. The old location was an example of a perfect dinner but the new one is far from that experience. There was a dead bug in the window, lots of garbage on the floor and the food was subpar. I truly hope they get it together.",Great food!

330,"Was seated at the noodle bar for a quick meal.  The night chashu men ramen was serviceable, with decently portioned amount of meat and a sprig of broccoli rabe.  The chicken wings were disappointing, as there were only five minuscule pieces ($12.50); it had a decent spiciness.  It was explained that the prices were reflective of the increase in minimum wage, but it was still dismaying to not be sated with the incurred cost.","Eh...So many fusion-ized Asian spots, so little appetite. The Original Takumen Chicken Wings aren't bad. But the Night Chashu Men Ramen Noodle was so salty, it was almost inedible. The Ban Ban Chicken Ramen Noodle was a bit better, but still nothing supreme.","3.5 really They keep on changing the menu...although some dishes are consistent and goodMiss the pork/bacon dishPricey drinksI guess the no tipping policy didn't work, so back to the client subsidizing the owner...or need to redo the numbers","Certainly not a destination dining spot, but a good neighborhood option for LIC with a nice casual vibes that's also baby / stroller friendly. Great for catching up with friends.The prices here aren't cheap but the portions are deceptively large. From the photos I was expecting to be hungry after ordering the Hawaiian tuna poke bowl, but ended up being very full, since as it turns out, the bowls that the rice bowls are served in are massive (which is why the portions look so small in the pics). I liked the variety in the bowl - from the cucumbers to the seaweed to the avocado. You're not coming here for the highest quality tuna but it works well with the sauce and the rest of the bowl. The TakuMen chicken for me was the standout - very juicy with a nice crispy exterior. Would recommend getting it as a side. Ramen seemed less impressive from what I saw - my friend's ban ban chicken was too salty.","I came here on a weekend night for quick dinner with a friend recently and had a good overall experience. It is a very casual restaurant and is probably better for a lunch or cup of coffee than a date night, but we had an overall good experience.On a weekend night, the space was full, but we seated ourselves at one of the remaining empty tables. We were promptly acknowledged and ordered drinks from their large selection.  We ordered a few sake and soda drinks (yuzu and peach) and were generally happy.  For our meal, we ordered a fried octopus appetizer and rice bowls (Hawaiian tuna and avocado assort). The octopus was good but not remarkable. Both rice bowls came with shishito peppers, which were the spiciest shishitos I've eaten--they were spicier than a jalapeño! They were so spicy that the table next to us commented about them to the waitress! To be honest for a place that services sushi and other raw fish, I was a little surprised that the tuna wasn't a little more flavorful. The avocado bowl though was delicious, especially the tempura avocado! In general, the meal was good but expensive for a casual atmosphere and basic rice bowls.  I'd definitely consider this place for a casual lunch or quick breakfast pastries, but in general the experience and food itself didn't warrant the prices.","It's not your traditional ramen or izakaya restaurant. Their menu contains more of the modern variety of Japanese food. I've never felt like it was a real izakaya place, where you can get an abundant of skewers or small little dishes. Their portions are usually big and expensive. They also have an tasting menu I've never tried but it looks worth it. I've had a numbers of their ramens but nothing where I craved over and over. The cilantro ramen is a bit tasteless and weird but others do like it. The ban ban chicken is okay. The goma miso is probably the best one with the heartiest broth. I've heard great things about the Hawaiian poke. The miso crusted wings with peanut is salty and feels heavy but tastes good. I've had few cravings for this place but would be worth to give other items a try.",Takumen
331,I have been here 3 times. First time was amazing. I decided to bring a friend again another time. We both loved it. The 3rd time was a disaster.  I brought another friend to show of this little Egyptian spot and the food was bland. It wasn't good like before and the worst part was there were roaches everywhere. TWICE they were crawling up my leg. One was behind my friend crawling up the chair. What the heck? It was so uncomfortable I got the check and left. I am so disappointed. I hope the chef can clean up his restaurant. Some of the stuff is just too old and it's borderline hoarding. It just needs to be thrown out and cleared. That's why there's roaches all over. I am sorry I won't be back unless I see he did a cleanup. It was really a letdown. :(,"I can't imagine anyone but an idiot not liking this place. Truly a one-man operation with chef-owner-waiter. My wife and I came here on date night, and it was a blast. BYOB so it's guaranteed to be affordable. We got the lamb cheeks, Shrimp Alexandria, and Tagine. Kicked ass! If the lamb was a woman, I'd have fucked it. Nothing bland or boring, done just right. Gotta love the few morons leaving bad reviews; particularly liked the asshole that was in Cairo for a few days (probably ate every meal at TGI Friday) and claimed to be an expert of Egyptian cuisine. Astoria neighbors: check this place out!","I stopped in this place with two friends from out of town who wanted to try Egyptian food.  The place is definitely cute from the outside and inside.  That's why I give this place 1 star and not 0.  The rest was an overall bad experience.  The service was VERY SLOW.  We waited about half an hour before we were able to place our order.  We wanted to leave, but then thought maybe the food was worth the wait.  This turned out to be wishful thinking.   The food was simply Blah...sooo disappointing, the two appetizers and the fish dish were just bland and the lamb shank was overcooked and dry.  At one point, one of the customers sitting next to us said to the owner, who is also the server (and apparently the cook which somewhat explains the very slow service) that he would step out to the mosque for his prayer and hoped his order would be ready by the time he returned.  The owner rudely snapped back at him "" you're wasting your time, don't bother praying, the gates to paradise are already shut"".  You can tell the poor guy was embarrassed. After this guy walked out, the owner loudly kept complaining to other customers why people bother praying, how stupid they are.. etc..  Really, skip this place.

My husband, sister and father treated my son to dinner here this past weekend to celebrate his 21st birthday. I've encouraged him to pick a cuisine that interests him and I do the leg work of finding a place that can execute it well so he has a good experience that's different every time. This time, though, I picked the cuisine and went with something along the lines of Middle Eastern.Because he's on campus in Long Island with a ton of work to complete, he just came for the night. I actually made reservations for an Egyptian spot down the block but we also had the baby in tow and the place we reserved was far too small for us to fit the stroller. The owner of that establishment directed us to Mombar, another Egyptian eatery, because the size would accommodate us and the owner, Mustafa, is family.Luckily, when we arrived, there was no wait. It's very small but they fit as many tables as possible in the space. There's an open kitchen and the decor and layout makes you feel as though you're dining in someone's home. Upon first impressions, it seems cluttered but I choose to see it as eclectic and authentic. We were able to squeeze out stroller in between tables but would have probably had a more difficult time had they been busier.This is not a place where y be grabbing a bite and running out. If you come here, be prepared to take your time, slow down and really enjoy your meal, company and the ambience.

Great for sharing and tasty.Be-Sara - Fava Bean spread, served with warm pita and so very good.Lamb Shank Special - covered in spinach and served with your choice of couscous or rice (get the couscous) which has fruit cooked in. Flavorful and spiced well. I loved it and the portion is enough for two meals.Lamb Chops - these were only ok to me. My son ordered and I tasted. He enjoyed it better than I.Steak - hubby ordered this. It tasted really good and was serve with veggies.Whole Striped Bass - my dad ordered this and loved it. He finished the entire platter. Yes. Platter. The fish was prepared for him and deboned so all he had to do was put fork to mouth.Lamb Tagine - my sister had this entrée and enjoyed it very much as it was also served with couscous.The spice situation here is on point! All of the food was really good. We enjoyed everything. They have some items for the adventurous eater such as, rabbit, lamb brains, tongue and testicle, but we kept it pretty neutral. I love rabbit but I didn't want to try at an unknown restaurant and apparently, their duck is a hot ticket item because they were sold out by the time we arrived.While I don't think I'd venture out to dine here again just because of geography, it's certainly worth a visit. The owner was so amazingly attentive to each and every patron and there were even a few regulars that came in to dine. Those kinds of diners are always a sign that you've stumbled upon a good thing, a hidden gem.","This worth checking out as a cultural experience and maybe slightly less so as a dining experience. The chef-owner is also an artist and craftsman whose work includes the intricate inlaid table tops, ceiling, floor, and densely curated objects on the walls. Service is quiet and somewhat ponderous. Try not to be anxious and appreciate that time moves differently here; he and his assistant in the tiny open kitchen won't hover or offer water incessantly. They will talk you through the menu and specials and then leave you alone until you're ready to order. We thought the Mombar, little sausages of rice and minced offal (liver?), delicately spiced in snappy chewy casings was the best and most interesting to eat. Neither that or the quite good mashed fava beans appetizer was photogenic, but both were quite good. The lamb tagine, on the other hand, was mediocre, neither well-seasoned or that tender with vegetables that were most likely from a frozen package. I only have a photo of the small pyramid of couscous to show you. Go and order something else and sit in for a slow ride back in time.",Mombar
332,"We came around 11:30am. There was only 2-3 tables but the staff were very busy preparing for lunch take out orders so it took about 10min for someone to come take our orders and another 5 minutes to bring tea after we had asked several times. The tofu dish came out before the tea arrived.We came for stinky tofu but it wasn't stinky enough.   Half of the tofu were hot and half were warm. They probably put some left over from breakfast on the plate since we came just after their breakfast menu was over. It was disappointing when we are expecting to bite into something hot and it was warm instead.We also ordered the spicy assorted mini hot pot. It looks nothing like the picture. The picture has clams in it but the actual dish doesn't have any clams. It cost $20+, overly priced for the portion. The portion is exactly what it's name says: mini---it has some noodles, some cabbage, few pieces of tofu, 4 pieces of beef, 2 pieces of frozen fish, 4 pieces of fish ball, 3 pieces of shrimp, and a few small thin pieces of pork intestine. Flavor was not that good either. Might as well add a few dollars for all you can eat hot pot.","Found a piece of PLASTIC BAG in the stir fried cabbage! Unbelievable, I almost eat it! Can I ask for a refund?","Food is good but the way they run the business is nor very honorable. I ordered the minced pork rice take-out and the cashier asked me if I want to pay $1.25 extra for the smoked egg. I declined. But I ordered the same dish many times via delivery services and for the same price, it always come with an egg and a much bigger portion. I hate to say this but it seems like they rip people off whenever they can. What a shame. If you don't believe me, just take a look at all the pictures posted by other dine-in customers and here is what I got.","I have finally found my favorite TW place to eat in NY. I even would say it's as good as Irvine, CA places. We went for lunch and got a few items from their lunch menu which come with a soup and a bowl of rice and a few other dishes from their regular menu. Service was intermittently slow which was irritating only Bc we got some dishes but the woman promised she would bring the rice 2x and was just too busy (and I wanted / NEEDED to have my rice with my food).  The soup was so good!! I would say everything was delicious and portions were proportional to the prices. The quality of the food was amazing and nothing was overly salted (they don't use MSG here thank god) and there was just the right amount of oil on EACH dish. I can't get over how legit each of these dishes tasted to TW food back in the motherland!! Their hot chili oil (is made in house) but you have to ask for it.I have been coming here regularly a few times a month for over a year and I am never disappointed. They also take credit cards which is a plus. There are 2 parking spots (4 & 5) which I think you need to get a card / paper to place on your windshield since I heard her asking every customer who came in. IMPORTANT: DO NOT park in the Home Depot parking lot and leave the premises to come here or anywhere. There are people who watch the lot like hawks and will tow you. We came back from a quick lunch and lost our whole afternoon waiting for the truck to come back to us ($125+tax and its cash only). Lots of other people also were towed lol so that made me feel better. Be careful and park on College Point instead.","My favorite Taiwanese restaurant in Flushing. I feel I've gone to so many and this one even my picky mother won't complain. There are 3 parking spots in front which also make it such a good place. Where do you find parking spots in Flushing like this? I love the food - it is not oily, no MSG after feeling and the taste is always consistent time after time. I love ordering the Pork with bean curd, three cup chicken with no bones and the sizzling beef platter. The salt and pepper pork chop is also good. Classic Taiwanese dishes like beef noodle soup and stinky tofu and etc are also quite tasty. They also have the normal Chinese dishes; beef chow fun, Lo mein and fried rice. They have a sister restaurant Ok Cannan on Main St but I like this one.","I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. We ended up selecting this place by chance, while looking for places to eat.I shared the salt and pepper chicken and ordered a white rice. At first I was worried that this would be like popcorn chicken and that it would be too dry to eat on its own with just white rice. Surprisingly any additional sauce wasn't necessary. It was pretty good just on its own. Full disclosure - We asked the waiter if the dish was supposed to come with sauce and was told that people normally eat it without sauce in Taiwan.The chicken was juicy and flavorful and spiced nicely. One dish is definitely enough for two people to share. The texture is different. Its not like fried chicken or popcorn chicken, it was more like battered chicken with salt and pepper spices.",OK Ryan Restaurant
333,"Boon Chu's $2 ice cream they serve outside during the summer is soooo good. We got the red bean and matcha and they are both flavorful and refreshing. For $2 Matcha, you really can't beat that.As for the food, we tried the Pad Kra Prow and Beef Larb, both of which we had spicy and really hit the spot.","The food at this place is great. I would have loved to give them 5 stars but unfortunately there was a roach in my Thai tea. Even though I let the waiter know, she still charged me for the Thai tea that was undrinkable.","I love the Kaw Kluk Kapi here and the price of the food is very affordable. However, I had a horrible experience with ordering Pad Kee Mao. I ordered delivery today. First, they completely forget to make the Pad Kee Mao spicy after I requested for it to be between middle spicy and regular spicy. I called to complain. It was great that they send me another one; however, the new one is so spicy it is inedible. Why couldn't they do anything in between....","4.5 STARS - Been coming here for more than 7 years and the flavors are consistent. Have I had better? Yes, but there's something that keeps bringing me back. Faves are the spicy fried rice eaten with the fish sauce and peppers floating on top, papaya salad, and Thai fried chicken.","This is a Thai restaurant that you can visit regularly, prices are friendly in elmhurst, portions are decent, but seats are limited, I recommend for take out. Tips, the ice cream stand in front of their store belong to them too, I think. Very Thai style, no fancy cups or packaging, but worth a try, because it is very cheap and taste good.",They've upgraded the place since my last review and it looks great!  The've gone wood-centric from the walls to the tables and chairs.  They even updated the wall paper.Food is superb as always!,Boon Chu Thai Place
334,"The place is not on the beaten path, not too off the path, it was close to our hotel, the food we got was good. Waiter did keep my waiter full. Little wait in between us sitting and him coming back to take order and it wasn't that busy, but it was fine. The table was pretty sticky I just wiped myself. Wanted to get the curry, but it didn't come with rice had to pay extra that was disappointing so ordered the fried rice with tofu, I literally got 4 pieces of tofu.","I am a local, frequently I have been in the restaurant for more than 20 times, yesterday I had some colleagues in my apartment. I told them that os a really good restaurant so we ordered. I gave the order and my phone number to pick tge order up. Nobody called me after 40 minutes I gave them a call. They said its ready! Why they did not call me I don't know. I asked them they said we forgot. I went downstairs pick up the order,  No apologies from their part. When we tried it the food was cold. Then the vegetables were rotten (see photo attachment). Amd then we got sick with stomach pain. Its unbelievable how a good restaurant can be the worst, even report them to the consumers protection",Food was either extremely salty or bland. Their thai curries didn't even come with rice!! They charge extra $3 for rice which is not even one portion. Never been to a thai restaurant where curry was water and rice did not come out with the dish...,"Came here to grab a bite to eat before going out at night. I'm from DC so I don't know the area, but I would say that it is not in the loveliest of places. However, their food and service was exceptional. We ordered the basil fried rice with chicken and it was great. The food had a very unique and authentic taste to it. I also appreciated how the restaurant was decorated. I highly recommend eating here.","I love coming here when I'm at work - either for lunch or dinner! The quality of food is good. I always get the pad kee mao noodles and the Liu San. The liu San sauce is spicy and so yummy! The chicken wings are also super good, crispy and spicy. The Thai tea is also very good here- I don't like it when it's too sweet but it's just the perfect amount of sweetness. The chicken skewers were just alright - I've had better! Service is very good - the waiters/waitresses are very attentive and food comes out quick.",Nice cozy spot.  App was ok.  Mini pillows of ground chicken and shrimp.  Fish (recommended one). Whole snapper overdone.  Fried about 5 minutes too much.   Duck dish was overdone.  Legs were dry and hard.  Sorry,House of Thai
335,"I really have no complaints coming to Uncle Peter's. I really do love their complimentary bruschetta. There's so many menu items that I could recommend to you so ask me if you want. Some of my favorites are their penne ala vodka, entraña de la casa, seafood ravioli, the risotto, and salmon a la grilla. But really, I have no complaints. Everything always tastes delish.","Waiter sat us by the bathroom & kitchen entrance while there were seats available in the front of the restaurant... recommended the seafood salad which was amazing failed to mention it was $32 it cost more than both of our entrees , the house lasagna tasted like stouffers frozen lasagna I ate a corner of it & was gagging , in my drink I could hardly taste the Prosecco they claim is in the drink , will not be back & do not recommend",It's ridiculous to charge 25 dollars for a piece of salmon plus tax. I thinks it's overcharged,I went here today and had penne alla vodka the best I've had in my whole life like OMG!! Great service The area is in Jackson heights on a main road.,"Always on the lookout for a nice sitdown in the neighborhood. Friday night, no wait for a table of two at this Italian restaurant.To start off, ordered a bottle of Cabarnet ($35) - a thick, full-bodied red which went well with the two free appetizers they brought out. One is a small offering of bruschetta; freshly diced tomatoes over a olive oil soaked baguette slice. The other is a basket of fluffy bread that seeps up the wine until the main course arrived. The Salmon alla Grilla ($26) is a thick cut of fish topped by sliced avocado with a choice of side (rosemary potatoes for me). Fish has a strong lemon flavor from the juice they added, which overpowered the cream sauce. Meat itself is cooked perfectly as well as the hearty potatoes. Overall a lot to take in, so had to order half of it to go.Not really the easiest place to get to, but the service and ambiance are worth a visit.","Fresh appetizers we had for Crabmeat tower and Romaine salad. Black linguini or regular linguine are both yummy!! Lastly, must order the lava cake!",Uncle Peter's
336,"I went back to Malay last week and was utterly shocked and beyond disappointed to find out that they now serve grocery store roti with their roti canai ($3.75). I'm so baffled as to why this is a corner they'd decide to cut because it likely saves them little time OR money.... And what an insult it is to their customers to think that we wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the standard thin and flaky roti, and the thick and gummy stuff from the freezer aisle at the local Chinese market. Thankfully, the beef rendang ($14.95) and shrimp with cream ($14.95) were still very tasty.Service is still painfully slow. And while waiting for our takeout order, 3 loud and obnoxious women came in the restaurant begging for money, and the restaurant workers did nothing to shoo them out or protect their patrons from the verbal aggression that these women spewed.","The roti here is amazing!!!! I could eat 5 in one sitting. The string beans with shrimp was also really good. The satay was also really good. The noodles and fried rice I would skip. Food is cheap, but the restaurant doesn't feel too clean. Would come here just for their roti.","Kind of a hole in the wall, but Real  authentic I got take it it was good but not great.  I liked the chicken roti,  nasi lemak, and seafood noodles","Love this little place, food are good, service is depending on who the servers! Overall is good! I do love the satay beef and curry noodles soup , Hainanese chicken rice , I been to this place since I was in flushing in 1990 , taste of the flavor never changed!","Only ordered Pi pa duck takeout. My yelp friend Andie highly recommends this place. After beating up all Flushing insanity I got it today. So excited! Thank you Andie! It is more like dry roasted sweet duck. I really like its dryness, though it is too sweet to my taste. Quite different from Cantonese roasted duck I feel.  The Pi Pa duck is more like a Peking Duck slowly roasted and sweet bean paste used in the marination. Meat is fairly tender and moist. Kids would love it! Both are good. Thanks to Andie s tip that if you put the duck in oven roast more at home, it tastes even better! FYI, the menu is huge. Prices are changed.","After trying PappaRich and Satay, I can say that this is the most authentic, affordable, and tastiest Malaysian food in Flushing. The food is really flavorful and gives you that comfort feeling of eating delicious and hearty dishes.The freshly made Roti Canai had a crispy skin and was chewy but thin on the inside. When I pulled a piece off, you could see the stretchiness of the bread. It wasn't too thick or papery and it paired nicely with the curry (which had a nice coconut milk flavor).My shredded chicken w/ ho fun (flat noodle) had a really flavorful soup along with the tender chicken and slippery noodles. My mom really enjoyed her shrimp noodle soup (w/ a small spicy kick to it) and added that the soup had a good flavor (a little salty) while the noodles were chewy but a little soft. Place could've done with one less table so that there's more room for your chair to actually slide back without getting into a bumper car game with the people behind you but quality food",Malay Restaurant
337,"This kept popping up as a suggestion on yelp so I decided to give it a try. It's a bit off the beaten path. I can see why some ppl like it, but the atmosphere wasn't for me. A lot of young ppl though. Loud. Bartender seemed distracted in conversation with the regulars- not saying that's good or bad. Seems like a good place to grab a beer. I didn't particularly enjoy my dinner, so this rating is mainly about the food. To be fair someone did ask me how I was liking the food and I said fine so that's on me. There may be some things they do well on the menu and some they don't. I didn't try the pizzas for example. Not sure if I'd give it a second chance though since it wasn't my scene.","The delivery guy went to the wrong address, then called me and seriously argued with me on the phone, telling me that my address was wrong. At one point, he asked me how far away my apartment was from the Astoria Craft. I told him I didn't know and he said that the restaurant doesn't usually deliver out this far- so basically, he tried to tell me that it was my fault he couldn't find my address because I ordered pizza from Astoria Craft.  When he finally arrived with the pizza, he told me that my address was wrong and next time I need to call the restaurant. Then he told me that he remembers delivering to me before. Not sure how he was able to deliver to me without a problem last time (as he claims) if my address is wrong. I've also never had a problem with any of the restaurants I've ever ordered from, as far as my address is concerned.  Also, after my pizza was delivered, I looked up Astoria Craft on Google Maps and it said the restaurant is less than a mile from my apartment (0.55 miles to be exact).  Additionally, I paid $3.00 extra for toppings on my pizza. When I opened the pizza, it was cold and there were barely any toppings. I counted exactly 3 pieces of mushroom and 6 pieces of pepper on the entire pie. I understand that it's New Year's Eve and the restaurant is most likely very busy, but this is unacceptable.  Furthermore, I gave the delivery guy a $4.00 tip because I knew he was probably swamped with deliveries and in return I got extremely poor service. The first time I ordered from here I had a good experience, but sadly I won't be ordering from here again because I don't have time for incompetence.","This is just a bar. I've tried several times and each one is a disappointment. The best sandwich is a blt because it's a no brainer meal that even a high school kid without passion for cooking can make well. Went for a third time and literally final time and I didn't even stay. The AC sucked, counted more than 5 flies and the last two visits came to mind. The name makes it seem more than what it is. It's just a bar. Not a good one at that. No passion. No charm.Update...pardon me... the PLT","Where. To. Begin. Love this place - the food, staff, brunch, mimosas (yes, you can mess up a mimosa!) - we come here very often on Sundays and we are very grateful for this neighborhood restaurant !","Astoria Craft is a pleasant bar and restaurant. The service was friendly and efficient, and the bar itself is pleasantly decorated and relaxing.  They have a cool old map of Astoria on one part of the wall that's worth taking a look at. I have no complaints about the drinks but the food was lackluster at best.  The Impossible burger I tried was definitely not something I'd ever order again, and I've had Impossible burgers before and have loved them.  This one was odd.  I'm not convinced it even was an Impossible burger, because it tasted and looked like a veggie burger by some competitor brand.  The pickle chips were also underwhelming, and not nearly as good as regular pickle chips I've had elsewhere. My friend and I did show up on a Tuesday and it unbeknownst to us ended up being trivia night though, and so overall it was a fun time.  I'd come back, but I'm not sure I'd partake in their food again, or I'd just steer clear of the Impossible/ veggie burger.","I've come back several times and ordered different items. I do like the atmosphere of the bar, the beer selection, and the staff are nice. I had a burger again and I liked it. The pizza was okay. My favorite item though is the wings! Oh man could I eat those wings everyday. I order them for delivery a lot now. The buffalo sauce has great flavor. I appreciate the owner responding to my comment in a respectful way. And I am happy I gave this place another try.",Astoria Craft
338,"I came here with a friend on a Saturday night for dinner. The service was slow. They were not responsive nor attentive. It took them a while for water refill and the time it took them to make the food was slow as well. By the time the food reached to us it was already cold. We ordered an appetizer and an entree. They should have served the appetizer first so that the food didn't arrive cold. Anyways, we ordered: Mixed appetizer that had two empanadas, couple of yucca, and something else that I forgot their names. Anyways, by the time the appetizer reached to us it was cold. Not sure if it was intended to be a cold dish or to be a hot dish. Anyways I couldn't tell the difference.Milanesa mixta that consisted on two milanesa of beef and one milanesa of chicken. The beef was dry and too hard to chew on. The dish came with salad, mashed potato, and something else that I forgot the name of...  We wanted to order some soup but apparently they stop having soup after 9pm. Sad. : (","Food wise it is excellent and delicious! My husband is Paraguayan and I have come to love their food. The food is delicious, all the baked goods are amazing but their service is not great. Maybe it was just with us but the last time we went we had to struggle for somebody to acknowledge us and take our order...to the point we felt uncomfortable of being there. Nonetheless we ate and food was delicious but haven't been back because of their terrible service.","Wify gets her chipa (not sure how you spell it) here, and bunch of other indigenous sweets.Like the place for its authenticity and catering to native Paraguayans.","A friend recommended this place and truthfully I could not be more pleased. I've never had Paraguayan food before but I have to admit, it is spectacular. One of my favorite dishes was cheesy rice. I think it only comes with a certain set of dishes, so if it doesn't come with one of the dishes you want, ask if you can get it as an add on bc it is sooooo good. All rice should be cheesy rice. All of the dishes are quite hearty, so it's a great amount of food. Even the salad feels ""hearty"" to me, very tasty and still refreshing. I always get the steak with onions and two sunny side up eggs. We've gotten quite a few empanadas by now, and I have to say my favorites are the ham and cheese and the empanada with a raisin and some other meats in it. Overall the food feels really authentic and full of quality and love. Would definitely recommend checking it out!I'm looking forward to trying their giant meat platter soon, and some desserts, because every time we eat there were too full for dessert.","I've been saying ""I need to check this place out"" for the longest timeeee, and I finally went this past weekend and now I'm saying ""wow :( I wish I went sooner""The service was incredible! We walked in at 10PM, even though they close at 11PM (I'm sorry! I was feeling indecisive that day) and they treated us amazingly nonetheless. The food was so delicious, I can't wait to go back or randomly drop by for their corn appetizer. So good!","Chipa Guazu - cheese and corn casserole. They call this a soufflé on the menu, that's one way to class it up, I guess, but really it's a casserole and you can probably make a better version at home. It's edible though.Mbeyu - this was lacking, to say the least. It was super dry and desperately needed a condiment to add some flavor and/or moisture. I was hoping to ask our waiter for some ketchup or hot sauce to see if it would help, but unfortunately he was face timing using someone's phone at the next table over, so I ended up leaving most of this. Empanadas - served in baskets with the type of empanada written on the wax paper it's served on, except they didn't serve me the correct empanada despite this handy reference  Instead of what I ordered I received a ham and cheese empanada (pictured). I asked our waiter if this was the right thing, the paper did after all say it was what I ordered, and he confirmed it was not and took it away. About ten minutes later, after we picked through most of our food, another waitress came to bus the table. I asked her if the empanada I actually ordered was almost ready, and she seemed confused. After this point our original waiter no longer talked to us and we had to communicate with this woman, who couldnt really understand what was going on, on top of not being aware of the original mistake. She conferred with our original waiter and it seemed like he forgot to actually put in the corrected order after whisking the wrong one away? I guess NOW they started heating up the right one? But we still sat there not knowing wtf was going on, until the waitress came back and said itd be yet another ""few minutes"". Basically this could have been an easy mistake to forgive but because of the incredible lack of common sense and basic customer service skills on both their parts, ended up being a really aggravating experience. Both the woman who was sent over to bus the table and our original waiter apologized but at that point it's like, come on, you just made me sit here for an extra twenty minutes, I didn't get what I ordered, and all on top of serving me pork, which I would never knowingly eat, ugh. Morale of the story, if you make a mistake with someone's food, you should rectify it immediately, not wait for the customer to remind you, and don't even think of charging the customer for the item YOU messed up. None of that happened here, and when they actually brought out the correct order right when we were about to ask for the check it was like... Really? I'm obviously not paying for this, and no I don't want it after I finished my meal and am about to head out  There's way too many other good spots in Sunnyside to give this place any business.",I Love Paraguay
339,"What a solid sushi spot- no fuss, no fooling around too much with sushi, just genuine well-made sushi, yum. Ambience is casual yet romantic, service is impeccable, reservations fairly easy to make, a gem indeed!",Good but not good enough. We've tried almost every sushi omakasa in NYC. There're $500 pp places and $100 pp places and the in-betweens. This place falls in the lower end of the in between range. The problem is they are beat by the cheaper ones like sushi by bae in almost every aspect. Fish choices were not interesting enough. Some pieces were served too cold. Chef was boring. Rice was good. Cheap factory made wasabi. Gingers were too spicy but that's my personal preference. Given the competition I'm not coming back.,I will let the pictures do all the talking; the pictures will do this place justiceYou gotta catch them all,"TLDR: A quiet LIC sushi bar. Reasonably priced omakase that's great if you're venturing into omakase for the first time or if you've been into this style of dining for awhile. Sushi Daizen deserves it's place amongst all the Manhattan sushi bars. No theatrics, just a bar that serves excellent sushi and you'll keep coming back to.I had saw Sushi Daizen on Yelp some years ago and had placed it on my list. I eventually did make it over there and gave it a try. It reminds me a lot of a sushi bar in Tokyo. Very subtle signage, minimalist design, soft piano jazz.You can order a la carte here but the omakase is the way to go. For $75 you get a three-dish appetizer, a fish broth, 10 pieces of nigiri and a handroll. There is a sushi/sashimi omakase offered as well if you're trying to cut back on the rice I believe it's $90 but I can't remember for sure.The appetizers rotate but there is always the egg omelette included. This is then followed by the fish broth and then begins the sushi progression.I have been served by both Chef Etsuzo and the other chef - I don't know her name. They're both excellent though. Chef Etsuzo is great to talk with too, very laid back as he slices and prepares your nigiri.The nigiri here is a good size, not too small - not too large, just right. I love the taste of their rice here, the acidity is perfect and it just brings each piece together wonderfully. Sushi of course is - all about the rice.While the pieces vary a bit, the progression is usually the same more or less. Which I'm okay with, I know what I'm getting (give or take a few pieces) and I know that I'll enjoy it.The standout piece for me is always the barracuda when he has it. It's lightly torched that lends that smoky flavor and just leaves your face like O.O afterwards.You can always order more pieces if you'd like. I traditionally will get a handroll afterwards and then I'm good.I have been bringing friends here who want to try omakase or have been to quite a few on their own. I would say Sushi Daizen is probably my favorite between value, experience, taste, etc. I've frequented here more than any other sushi bar and I plan to for many years.Stop reading, call and book a spot at the bar. You'll be glad you did.","For a place in LIC, this place can be comparable to those in Manhattan. For the amount of pieces for the Omakase, it was good. However, for each piece of sushi, there was way too much soy sauce brushed on and like another reviewer had mentioned, the grain of rice a bit too long. Another concern, the sushi chef took kept all pieces of fish in the fridge until it was time to serve, basically serving chilled fish.  Sushi shouldn't be served that cold.","It's nice to have a relatively inexpensive (key word: relatively) in the neighborhood. We've been here a few times and have experienced both a regular table and the sushi bar. There really is just one menu - omakase for sushi. For $75 you can do 10 pieces or 6 piece sushi + sashimi for $90. We have gone for the 10 piece every time here. The fish is pretty good quality. Nothing has blown me away, but everything has been solid each time we've visited. At the end of course you can order ala carte including sushi that you might not have been served during omakase.Overall, if you're in the area and want a relatively inexpensive omakase for sushi, then it's a good option.",Sushi Daizen
340,"I've been to this restaurant twice and each time I leave carrying my belly out. This place definitely serves authentic Italian food.

Plenty of parking which is a plus as they don't have valet.  Made reservations for 4 at 6pm Saturday. Our friend had been there previously and enjoyed the food and service. He spoke highly about the great service he received from the owner/staff and asked about her. He was told she's currently on vacation. Bread served immediately but our friend who had been there previously felt rushed from the minute we sat down. We were busy catching up and having some cocktails. The server came around a few times for our appetizer order. We ordered two orders of the baked clams and shared there special homemade cream sauce pasta. I really enjoyed both of these dishes and was looking forward to my entree. They have a bunch of specials. They all sounded amazing! We all ordered from their specials. I ordered the soft shell crab which at the price I would've expected them to be decently sized. I had one decently sized and the other super small! Taste wise it was just okay! Not worth the price tag. I don't mind paying at all for food as long as it's worth it! The side for it was okay some sort of cheese zucchini wrap. I wish they had other options to accompany the dish. Our friends said their meals were just okay nothing to rave about. Our friend who came here previously was disappointed as he said it was different when he came. Dessert - Napoleon, cappuccinos and sambuca. Talk about delicious! So fresh,delicious and not too sweet! We all loved the napoleon! Get this dessert truly amazing! Caps were great too! After this some of us had another round of cappuccinos. Unfortunately, although yes they were busy there were plenty of open tables but we felt rushed. So we quickly paid the bill which was not cheap but fairly priced and ended up talking in the street. We left feeling slightly disappointed in food some hits some misses and but overall the disappointment was the service. I still gave them 3 stars due to certain food items and for one of the waiters who was not rushing us.",Can't believe I have passed this restaurant for decades and never eat there until recently. What a GEM! Old school waiters whom cater to your every desire. The gnocchi were like little pillows of air so light and delicious best I have ever eaten. The tortellini Alberto is incredible as well as the mains. Make sure u leave room for dessert! My new favorite place for celebrating!,Phenomenal AUTHENTIC Italian dining experience in the heart of Queens!!! Phenomenal service and food and the exact atmosphere you hope for walking in,Alberto Restaurant
341,Good service and selection of destination beers including your Hefeweizens and dunkels. The kitchen is always cooking up a feast so get her early for seats!,"Ordered mashed potatoes and found a hair, the waiter was really nice however he took it off the bill.",Lied too this waitress and I have  been coming here for the last 2 years go on down the rode topicals restaurant no longer my fave,"I can't say enough good things about this place.  Now I get the same thing every time pretty much, the chicken or pork schnitzel with the mushroom gravy, my two sides are mashed potatoes and cheese pasta, and a slice of chocolate cake.  It is heaven!!!  I lived in Germany for two years and this just takes me back to those perfect simple meals I had in every little town.  If you are looking for a real hearty homemade meal, this is it!  Go get it!!!!Oh and the Apple streusel thing!  Get that too!!!","Schnitzel Schnitzel Schnitzel!...great neighborhood restaurant, worth traveling to from other areas. ...lots of outdoor picnic seatingpro tip... schnitzel comes with two sides. Everything comes on one place. If you order something with liquid, I suggest you ask for it on the side, in order to preserve schnitzel crispy goodness. ...sausages are good too, and beer is cold.","Just go have a beer and try the sides, if that doesn't convince you then pay and leave! you don't need to eat there.Your seat will be gladly taken by someone who knows good German food or just good food in general.I'm heading there now!! Ich bin bereit zu Essen",Max Bratwurst und Bier
342,"This place used to be my favorite taco spot in East Elmhurst, but over the past few years it's changed a lot... mostly for the worse in my opinion.The prices have gone up a lot since then (understandable) but the quality of the food has definitely gone down.The meat is still tasty but not as fresh as it used to be. The beef particularly is more chewy/ rubbery than before. I also noticed they've been putting less meat in the actual tacos/ sandwichesThe sauce has also changed a lot (maybe due to change in management?) the green and red sauce don't taste anything like they did before and look so watered down that they barely have the bright colors they once did.The amount of sauce they give you also decreased and you have to pay more for extra.Overall, I am disappointed with how this establishment has changed over the past few years I've been going to them. The food is still tasty but I would not and have not been ordering from them as often as I used to.","Please read! This place used to be awesome. They changed owners and the quality went down and prices went up. Not worth visiting anymore. The carnitas tacos were chopped pork, chewy and over cooked. Not shredded like usual. Rice and beans $6, for a small serving. Tacos are not filled with meat and they didn't taste good either. Dad how this place changed.","I ordered for pickup today, got there 20 min after I ordered and they started making my food when I got there. The whole point of picking up is exactly that to pick up and leave. If I wanted to wait I would've ordered in  the store. You guys should really work on that it's the third time it happens and I'll truly take my business else where. The tacos were thrown in the container, no order. They didn't add any radishes. I asked for extra sauce and I got no sauce at all. I was all about this spot when they were first opened but idk what's happened lately.  P.S. don't get they're empanadas, they're just straight up gross. I think there boxed frozen empanadas and I ordered a chicken and cheese they were undercooked and just gross they were cold and soggy. Just don't!",It was a great taco place! The owner is very welcoming and they are so helpful with the menu for the newbies like us at this place. The soup was delicious! Definitely a place to visit over and over! Gracias Taqueria Santa Fe por tan buen servicio!,Nice local taco spot. The foods pretty good.The staff is thoughtful and friendly.Its a given that we will return!,"Very impressed with the quality of the food! Met the new chef at another Mexican restaurant, and definitely  am coming to this one more often. Suggestion: Mexican Torta!",Taqueria Santa Fe
343,"Shrimp taco (2 pieces)I ordered delivery today and this means ""Shrimp Tacos"" but it looks like ""shit"". And that's right cuz iz da shit!",Update 6/13/2019. I took a star off. Got a bacon cheeseburger and a water for $10.90. A guy who ordered after me got his much larger order first. Annoying. My burger came out with no cheese and no bacon. When I brought this to their attention they showed me a handwritten order even though my order was by them on an iPad. After a conversation the lady said they'd remake it. Burger came back 3 minutes later with bacon and cold unmelted cheese. It was fine but not great. Maybe Jane's gets another chance but I can't guarantee it. Original Review: Really great. Burger fries and a water for $13 and change. Fries are legit. Burger was cooked through but still juicy and delicious. Order at counter and they bring it to you table. Limited seating. 2 picnic tables. 2 high top tables. 4 stools at a counter. I will definitely be back.,"I'm a meat person so I got the Mexican burger. While the burger toppings were decent - the meat was not stellar. It didn't taste like pure ground beef and it was not seasoned with salt or anything. I also had an issue with the avocado as it looked like the Sabra Gucamole instead of fresh avocado. The price point is right so I may give this place another try for their chicken burger but I am not recommending the beef.Additionally, the yam fries are not sweet potatoes equivalent. They are not as sweet and are disappointing. The onion rings are in tempura batter.","Good: -They have variety of Burgers, Sandwiches which are not often available food is good, not great. Good value. -The lady at the counter was very nice and was open to customizing my order-Reasonable price-They have Jamaican Ginger BeerBad: -Not the most comfortable seating. I prefer places with back supported seats.- I asked for a cup of water & a cup of ice and recieved very small cups. A bigger cup for the soda at least please.-All plastic utensils & platesI will be back.","UPDATE: Jane's has the best iced coffee hands down. I'm   hooked for life. Such a tasty & pleasant place to grab a bite in Bayside! Almost everything on their menu has a great unique flavor. I recommend their house potato chips (which is not too salty like original ones in markets & more crispy), lobster roll, quesadillas, & herb sweet potato fries. The owner lady is also so sweet to returning customers like my mom lol. It is no surprise that this eatery has such high reviews. I'm so glad that they opened up here.","Such a tasty & pleasant place to grab a bite in Bayside! Almost everything on their menu has a great unique flavor.

344,"What a let-down. We saw good reviews online and know that the place is run by Japanese people, and thought we'd like to try. We tried at least 3 times to book without avail, so when we got the reservation in we were excited to finally be able to try the place. We ordered both cooked food and raw food, 3 items each. The cooked food was pretty decent quality, but the portions are ridiculously small for $20+ mains. For example, the pork belly dish features 2 pieces of pork belly, 2 pieces of mochi, and 2 pieces of broccoli (an odd one!). The raw items were the real let-down. The sashimi was not fresh (you can tell without even eating, just by the color and sheen), and the fish variety was limited. We were told that some of the fish is from Japan. You know what, it doesn't matter if the fish is from outer space if it's not fresh.We're really disappointed as we expected so much more for a (once) Michelin-recommended and supposedly authentic Japanese restaurant.","I have eaten here a few years back.  My only complaint before was the pricing.  However, the quality of the food served justified the pricing in my mind.  The owner definitely doesn't cheap out on the food.But that is not the reason for the bad review.  I recently went with my wife this week.  The food was still good but the service had a lot to be desired.Upon entering the restaurant the food server coldly said reservations only.  I was confused by this as I wasn't aware that this was ever done.  We were never asked this before.  What made it worse was that all tables but one were empty.  The waiter than realized I was looking at all the empty tables and she said ""only this time could I take you.""  She then walked away in a huff.  This was the start to a bad meal.As we waited for our meal other diners came into to the restaurant and were offered a seat immediately.  There was no mention of reservations only.  The same waiter's demeanor changed from cold to warm and friendly when it came to the other tables.  I was already becoming frustrated by the fact that the other diners weren't question if they had a reservation or not.  My wife and I felt singled out.  Why? I dare not think about the reasons why, less I get more upset and this post becomes politicized.We then decided to order more food.  The same waiter seemed annoyed that we requested the menu.  Again, I just don't understand what the problem was.  We were ordering more, which meant a bigger bill and a bigger tip for her.When the time came to settle up I actually for once contemplated not tipping.  The fact that I considered doing that really bothered me because I'm not the type to do something like that.  That's how upset I was with the way we were treated.I then called the waiter over and politely asked her to clarify the need for a  reservation.  She had a hard time explaining it to me.  I then pointed out that the diners that came while we were there did not have reservations, hinting that she did not question them.  She was not able to give me any straight answers.Completely dissatisfied with what was happening I decided to take the high road and move on.  Our dinner was already being ruined.  I tipped her (which some would say I'm rewarding bad behavior).  I will no longer ever considering going there. I will tell everyone I know not to eat there.  There are plenty of Japanese restaurants in Queens let alone the rest of NY.",Not impressed. There are way better sushi places in Forest Hills and I'm the city. This place is small and service is slow.,"Tea and beans are meant to be spilled. The same goes for secrets. Sort of. Expectations wise. Not milk tho. But I digress. I personally stumbled into this place thinking I could buy a duck udon to go for my mother since the weather was getting cold. Upon finally finding the relatively unmarked door (security grate over the window is left down), I was immediately told by the maitre d/server/owner?, nah we don't do take out or to go. So mission failed. Then I remembered the website said reservations only. So I walked back in the door again and thought ah why not see why this udon nazi place doesn't do take out or to go. Made a res for the next evening. And man was I glad I did. This place is versatile. It's not just udon. I had the beef tataki app. Perfectly cooked thin slices of steak with a vinegrette salad on top. Had the tuna tartare app. Balanced and light and delicious. Also went with a chicken karaage. So juicy and crisp. But wait... Before I take a selfie... Where's the sauce? I only see a small wedge of lemon. That's right. No spicy mayo type orange sauce usu standard with this bird. That's how good it is. Doesn't need sauce. Seasoned just right either with salt and or from the marinade/brine. For mains we went with duck and pork udons. Simple, but very good. Udon noodles had a nice bouncy mouthfeel. Soup was light but flavorful. Protein was thinly sliced and cooked to perfection (pink for the duck, fully cooked for the pork). For desert we had the home made shiso flan. Good flan but not sure I really tasted much shiso. But it's flan so can't be too aggressive with it I suppose. All in all ordered so much, ate so much and didnt spend very much. Compared to Manhattan that is. Based on experience,food of this quality would easily be 40% mor expensive and not be 40% better tasting in the city. If I were to compare the udon, I'd first think of raku, whose  udon was more rich. Noodles were def hand kneaded and pulled. Noodles here... Hard to tell. But they were still great and didn't get soggy. The broth at raku is also much heavier and saltier. Hard to say which is better. To each their own one may suppose.Bottom line, I will be back here. Too many things still to try on the menu. Cooked and raw, the menu has it all and I am confident to say will likely not disappoint. I will make that blind bet all day. Outside on the window, all the Michelin recommended stickers might say something my non stop rambling hasn't. But as for all things worth experiencing, do try for urself. So there is a notable community of Japanese who live in forest hills, here for work I assune. But not many Japanese restaurants I would care to go to. Who knows. You might add one to ur list even if ure not from queens. If not, I'll gladly take ur reservation. Much appreciated.","Sorry, we wanted to like this place very much.  Here's the deal: the food is good (no problem with quality) but not spectacular.The problem lies in the portion and price.  The prices are ridiculously high and the portions are tiny.After the $70 dinner, I grabbed a slice of pizza up the street. The slice was great.",I dined on Friday night. I made a reservation but I don't think it'll be necessary as there were only 2 tables when we got there at 7:45pm and it was 2-3 tables throughout the night. We left around 9:30pm. Tofu with uni(sea urchin) is to die for!! Soooooo gooooood. Fish were fresh. Overall very good. I just wish service was bit faster.. I think they only have one person in the kitchen and I saw only one sushi chef so it took forever to get all our orders. I will go back if I'm not that hungry.,Katsuno
345,Got a message from the business manager and it was pretty hostile and disgusting. People write reviews here to be honest- if you don't like honest feedback then there's something wrong with you. Message attached below.,"Shameful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Drove over 45 min to get here and an additional 20 min looking for parking walking over 5 blocks. We walked in and had to look for someone to help. Finally, a lady comes up to us and the first words out of her mouth was ""do you have a reservation""? We told her we did not and the next words out of her mouth was ""we can't help you then"". We looked around and saw literally 20+ open seats. She spoke to us as if we were beneath her and that this place is doing us a favor if they accepted us. Just so we're on the same page... WE PAY YOUR SALERY! You continue treating people the way you did with us, you'll find yourself in the unemployment line.   We asked her to ask the manager if he can make an exception or even outdoor seating. Keep in mind we were not argumentative what so ever as were mainly seeking options for our long drive here. She went to the back and came back 30 seconds later stating the manager said that there was nothing they can do. We did not push for an argument and ended up leaving extremely insulted. I can't say with certainty however, my daughter was wearing the hand of god around her neck and I noticed the lady continue to stare at it. If your not familiar with this specific necklace, it represents Judaism. Mind you were in a Turkish restaurant. Not insinuating this place is biased but based on the lady continuously looking at the necklace.... it just makes you wonder why we were treated the way we were.      Very rude staff and no apologies. Will highly recommend seeking other restaurants.","Food is ok but service is horrible. We had to ask multiple times for our water to be refilled. They gave us a large platter of chicken adana when we asked for a small, and then blamed us for not notifying them, as if we are the ones who are supposed to keep track of the portion sizes. Different waiters kept bringing us the wrong orders multiple times and some of the waiters are just plain rude. After such bad service, even good food starts to taste bad.","Service: Always great, staff is very attentive! Drinks are always filled! They are always respectful. Food: The food was INCREDIBLE! Minus the hummus, which was a little lackluster in terms of taste. The sigara borek, the stuff grape leaves, and the adana plate were slam dunks! I come here because the food is always great. Ambiance: Its beautiful inside, great for dates, small parties, or mass gatherings. They have an open space in the back I guess for private events!Location: Love Astoria :)","Appetizer: Absolutely love the mixed dip app and I'm here atleast once a week just for that. It's the perfect dinner on a hot summer night when you're trying to have something light and cold.Outdoor seating: Really nice set up, feels very private. I come here specifically for the outdoor seating but the mosquito issue needs to be addressed. Con: Mosquitos in the outdoor seating area!","It was a Saturday night and my family and I were looking for a place for dinner and found ourselves at Truva. We were a party of 6 and had no issues getting a table when we arrived. Unfortunately, the outside seating was all taken or most tables were reserved, but we just sat inside. Not a big deal.I ordered the Mixed Grill ($25). It included beef/lamb gyro meat, chicken shish kebab, lamb shish kebab, and adana kabab served with rice and mixed green salad. They also gave us warm complementary Turkish bread with tzatziki sauce.It didn't take too long to prepare our orders and before I knew it, I was digging in! All the meats were absolutely delicious. Super tender, well-seasoned, and full of flavor! The rice and salad were pretty basic but went well with the meats which were the main stars of the dish.The meal was definitely shareable among 2 people. I only ate half of it and brought the rest home. For being $25 and 2 meals, it is worth it! Shout out to the waiter for the friendly, quick, and efficient service.If you're looking for some solid Turkish food in Astoria, definitely check out Truva!",Truva Cafe and Grill
346,"What happened? There's no longer an A rating and the place looks shabby. The floors look greasy and dirty and there are cheap paper placemats.  Even the cocktail menu on the table is food/water stained and the leather is peeling.  And the tap  water was warm and tasted stale. I've never tasted Queens water like that. Oh well, I won't be back. 3 stars because the food wasn't bad, but should be 2 because I'm wondering about the kitchen condition.","I find there Naan bread to be too much flour and not enough of the advertised ingredients.  Not the best I've been too.  I am leaving the Naan bread behind, and that never happens.Been waiting :20 minutes and haven't had anyone come to serve me.  I was going to order dessert, and I'm just pissed to ff at the pretentious waiter here on Rockaway Blvd.   There is really nothing to be pretentious about!At least the owner asked me if I was finished, :10 minutes ago.  This is bullshit.","After reading all the great reviews and having it bookmarked for so long, I was excited to try this restaurant and I really wanted to love it but I was terribly disappointed. The chicken and Broccoli was terrible, the Garlic rice was just ok, the Singapore noodles were mediocre. The best thing we had was the Tilapia in Schezuan sauce and the hot and sour soup. The service was really good but not enough to save the lame dishes. I don't understand where all the great reviews are coming from. The food was so bad that I was beyond pissed that I had to pay for such nonsense that was trying to be passed off as food.",We're just staying in a hotel near my for an early morning flight. So glad we decided to  leave the hotel restaurant behind and try this place! The neighborhood is a little sketchy but there was plenty of parking right in front! The food is delicious! Some of the best Indian food I've ever had. Colossal shrimp tandoori! The mushroom app... yum!!! My husband's  lamb dish was heavenly!,"Stopped here for a quick bite and a grand rush of nostalgia. Not sure if this is the same Nanking as in India but we decided to believe it and relive our childhood memories. The place was not too busy for a Sunday. The host was gracious and had us pick our spot. We decided to skip on the drinks and go straight for the food. We ordered chicken corn soup, chicken Hakka noodles, Spicy garlic fried rice, and chicken Manchurian gravy. This was pretty much our exact same order growing up. The waiter was kind enough to check with us our spice levels. Overconfident of my desi palate, I asked her to go spicy, especially when she said other people ask for XX spicy - A bad idea! When the food arrived, it was great to see the portions making it totally worth the money. The food was fresh and all the flavors were on point. No complaints at all. I did notice other people ordered a lot of Indian food like chicken tikka and naan etc. FYI, Nanking is usually great for their Indo-Chinese cuisine and if you get just that, I promise it will not disappoint!Definitely coming back here!","Didn't quiet know what to expect, but I was surprised.  This is a cosy with a modern layout with a few tables around 20 and a small bar (no seats at bar).  The fusion spreads accross with Thai, Singapore, Chinese, and Indian.  When you check in on yelp you get a free mangotini- which is sweet mango forward, but does have the taste of booze at the end.I tired the hot and shout soup, with chicken and it was a bit salty (soy sauce heavy) but was one of the best I have had.  For the main, I tired to Singapore chicken and veggies noodles and it was also great, was a bit spicy which I enjoyed.  They also have two sauces that is places on the table along with sliced Fresno peppers.  I will be back to try some other items.",Nanking
347,"I was at nowadays with a couple of friends about a week ago, I didn't spend long enough here to really experience it fully so this review is really only about the food. I ordered the jerk chicken thighs with rice and beans, the other alternative was flatbread. After about 1 minute the food was ready.No exaggeration - this was the absolute worst rice I've ever had in my life. Hands down. It could not have been worse. There were no grains, it was just one big rice glob. I brought it back and the woman who handles the orders asked the cook ""is the rice fresh?"" and his answer was ""I don't know."" They offered me ""flatbread"" instead, which was a large tortilla. Because of how hungry I was, the chicken was edible, but it was pretty bad and was definitely not jerk chicken.","I went to see Tony Humphries DJ here.  The event was at 10pm and, since this place doubles as a restaurant prior to nighttime events, there was a thick fog that smelled like smoked meat.  I don't mean to be nit-picky, but, man, it did not set a good mood for having a nightlife experience.  The indoor portion was not air conditioned, or poorly air conditioned, and there was absolutely no light.  It was like a bad haunted house.  My wife and I ended up hanging outside most of the night, which was a shame, because we really wanted to hear Tony DJ.  The crowd was pretty much there to drink and BS, there was some dancing happening, but it seemed like most people were there just to sit around and talk.  Not my cup of tea.  We were also accosted by a particularly ""out of it"" patron, but that is not particularly the fault of the venue.  Just not psyched about this locale.  I went here because Mister Sunday/Saturday moved here and I loved the Industry City party, so thought it would be that same vibe.  Definitely not.  Too bad.",Your food is ok but not worth the 2 hour wait. Your beans are dry. And your pico de gallo had too much agua. No thank you keep your non bushwick patrons,I reserved two tables here for my birthday celebration on a Saturday. The process was super easy and the staff was very accommodating when I had to change the date last minute. I used to frequent this place when it first open and it was incredible to see the transformation! The space is well decorated and a nice vacation from your busy NYC life. The drinks are good and cheap (compared to other NYC places)! The spiked lemonade is no joke so tread with caution. The bathroom trailers provide a great backdrop for your golden hour selfies and inside they're very clean. They also have games you can check out as well as other events happening throughout the month. I wish I didn't live in Philadelphia so I couldn't frequent this place!,"Saturday night, 10pm. Nice crowd. Great atmosphere to kick back and enjoy the beer menu and whatever games you want to bring from home. Picnic table seating with unique lighting set up. Staff is friendly and patient. I was hoping for much better mix of music and was disappointed for the food truck having 1 option left on their menu by this time. It seems like if the place is open so late, the menu should be able to hold the crowd. Also, typical area pricing for the 'pork bowl' meal, tad bit pricey and the portion was skimp. Left starving and in need of a good music playlist for the ride home.","This place is beautiful i recently moved into the area and decided to go there with two of my friends. I wanted my friends to have a nice experience as they came out of town to see me. However the bartender (young woman with black hair )was so rude to me and my friends. She asked for ID and we said "" we haven't been carded in a while that is nice "" making a joke , she responded in a condescending tone "" well I don't have a bouncer what do you want"" and we told her it wasn't in a negative way she continued to be rude and we went to sit and have our drinks. We went for our second round and she proceeded to be so rude to my friend and had the audacity to mess up her drink and refuse to remake it and CALLED HER HOMEGIRL ! well we are African american and with a combination of her rudeness AND CALLING HER HOMEGIRL, we were left feeling discriminated against and uncomfortable this was an embarrassment to me and my friends and I hope she gets sensitivity training ! if this is not rectified i will contact the NYC Dept on Human rights.",Nowadays
348,"Came back to Nick's recently in need of some proper pizza.Pizza is for sure still a 5 out of 5, but had to take a star off by obligation for the lack of soap in the bathroom. I didn't think much of it until my date asked, ""how do they wash their hands when they use the bathroom?"" and then I had that ""oh crap"" moment we all get, like when you forget your keys in the apartment and locked the door behind you. It's a gut punch.Additionally, the person in charge seemed to have a cold, sneezing into his elbow, and occasionally into his hands, then clearing tables and moving the salt/pepper shakers around. It's weird to watch.Love the pizza here and I think we just caught them on a bad day, but can't forgive the lack of soap in the bathroom.","We ordered the small pizza with pepperoni, sausage and artichoke. It was crispy and just salty enough. Overall it was good but I think too pricey for the area. We had an outside drink and the waiter told us we can't drink it just as a side note.","Every time I come to Nick's pizza, it's always an extremely terrible experience. They have decently good pizza for Forest Hills and they really take advantage of that. This time, the experience was the worst. I called and ordered a pick up order 4 hours ago, I called an hour before to confirm. We finally got there, slightly later than the allotted time, and they just started making the pizza, but didn't even prioritize us or apologize for the delay. Every time I feel the servers couldn't care less about the needs of their customers, need water refill? Forget about it. Need napkins? Crushed peppers? Nobody cares. They'll tell you that yet don't know or they don't have time to take care of you, because they're always so busy. Every time I come in here, I feel personally offended, how could they care so little about their customers. This time, however, will be the last time I come here. It's not worth it to be treated like this, the pizza is not worth the horrible treatment of the customers.","Yum!Attentive staff, familiar faces... Never disappoints!!!Tasty salads, pizza never disappoints & friendly drinks... You can't go wrong","Tonight the pizza was excellent - the dough, the sauce, the cheese - just excellent. In the past, the bottom has been a little burnt.What I strongly disagree with is the topping pricing scheme. At about $4 per topping, you could double the price of the pizza with just a couple veggies plus meats. Obviously toppings don't cost that much. Other pizza menus have many reasonably-priced specialty pizzas with pre-selected toppings.If other customers reading this could add their thoughts on the topping pricing issue, we could inspire real change toward fair topping prices.",This is definitely one of the best pizza spots in queens. Evidently I'm not the only person that thinks so as the lines to get seated kept forming. If you want to skip the dinner rush the best thing to do is come before 7pm. The servers are very good as they keep the customers moving along. I looked at the menu and I wanted to order a lot of things such as the white and red sauce on a regular pie with a whole bunch of toppings. We opted for the Grandma pizza which is good for two people. It reminds me of the Sicilian pies but not as thick. I would go back to try the calzones and their regular pizza pie.,Nick’s Pizza

( I know this is not Dos Caminos, but never have I been served guacamole in this presentation) important to note: this guacamole is NOT made to order in fact it needed our salt, pepper and hot sauce fixin'. * also let me add: their salsa tasted like it came from a jar.  3. NEXT.... our waiter approached us and we were busy enjoying our drinks when he told us that we basically needed to order quickly because people were waiting to be seated.4. He disappeared for about 20 minutes and when he came back we gave him our order and said we would probably order more drinks in a few. 5. 5 minutes later he brings us another round of drinks while we still had 1/2 of our first drinks full- we're confused because we never ordered them/ he did offer to take them back. 6. We waited like 30 minutes for our food of which half was missing. 7. We never got water and had to ask for it.The spicy quesadillas were tasty, nothing special but good. I think most people come for the drinks - got the frizeb margarita - it's a good value. I say go and get a pre dinner drink and go elsewhere for food unless of course you don't care much for customer service and just need to eat whatever. Don't expect to be thrilled - it ain't happening here.","This was our first time to 5 Burro and I'm not sure why it took us so long, especially since the hubby loves Mexican.It was a pleasant surprise. I think I was expecting it to be less than spectacular and totally caught me by surprise. The food was really good, and the service was excellent. This was really a quick in and out on the way home. We started with the  Queso Fundido ($12.00): Melted Monterrey Jack cheese blended with spicy Mexican sausage, topped w/ pico de gallo and jalapeños, served w/ flour tortillas.OMG. It was so delicious. In our less calorie-minded days, we easily could have ordered another one. It was so good.Then we both had fajitas. They were so good. And, I don't say that lightly. We tend to try restaurants randomly all the time, so we were really on a Mexican kick a few months ago, and went to several very, very authentic restaurants. These were definitely on par and comparable.I had the Fajita Combo with steak, shrimp and chicken. Jayson had the Fajita steak. They really hit the spot. 5 Burro clearly also gets the drinking crowd with a dozen frozen alcoholic treats. We don't drink, but the people around us had pitchers of frozen Margaritas and Pina Coladas and a bevy of others cocktails and clearly they are crowd pleasers.The woman next to us was there with her mom and her six-year old. And, grandma and mom were having a good old time while junior enjoyed his dinner. You can't really miss with this place.",So good! They don't have a happy hour but they do have terrific food and drinks. The perfect spot to catch up on Friday after work. We had the queso fondido and margaritas. The service was slowish but they seemed understaffed. The food and drinks were terrific.This place is really cute too.,"I came here on a Saturday night the place was packed we were told about a 15 min wait. I was able to order a drink at the bar, the bartender was very attentive so it wasn't hard to get a drink while waiting for the table The drinks come in a mason jar they were pretty good.. I ordered queso fundido which tasted great because it wasn't too greasy like most places serve them.  I also like the fact that they have touch tunes so I was able to listen to what I wanted while enjoying my drink :-)",5 Burro Cafe
350,"Came here based on the rave reviews but I wasn't too impressed. I did only order one thing so I will give it another shot at some other point. Upon walking in, you walk up to the counter and order your food. I got the Spicy Cumin Lamb Noodles and I thought it wasn't that flavorful compared to other noodle soup dishes I've had at other Chinese restaurants. Also felt that the price was a bit steep when compared to other restaurants that actually serve noodle soup in a ceramic bowl and the portion sizes aren't as big either. I wasn't a fan of the noodles either - too big and thick for my preference. Where them skinny noodles at?!Perks is that it is a quick option but there are so many other Chinese food options in Flushing, that I won't be rushing to come back here if I'm in the area. Also the place can use a bit of cleaning, tables are not clean and the trays are a bit oily.","Long time diner, first time reviewer here. Anytime we have to drop/pick up someone from JFK, we always take a detour to their Flushing location (25mins max. from JFK) to grab a bite to eat. Here are some pros and consPros:+ very affordable. Most dishes are under $15. + quick service+ pure explosion of flavor+ although they say that the noodles don't taste as good if it's not eaten fresh, I didn't find that the case. The soupy noodles especially heat up really well+ looks like they are passionate about recycling Cons:- Seemingly they use the same spice in every dish. So you are not going to get a variety of flavors from dish to dish- The BBQ dishes lack seasoning - Limited and uncomfortable seating space. I would not suggest this place for handicapped individuals I highly recommend the dumplings in spicy/sour soup. YUM!","I regularly check in to this Xi'an. Today at 12pm, I was very disappointed. There was 10 people waiting to order. We all waited for more than 5 minutes, then cashier says there was a computer glitch and there is a 10-15 minute wait.I understand nobody wants this to happen, but cashier could take paper orders.","I've been coming here for just under 10 years for the lamb cumin noodles, I love the new store front location, I don't live in queens anymore but it's worth the drive from Long Island.  I wish they would bring back the lamb skewers they started when they opened the new store front, BUT it would never keep me from coming here. My favorite dish never changes, I come in for lunch and I take another order home for dinner!! Simply the best.Came again today for lunch, of course I had to take 2 more orders to go!  Lamb cumin for days!! Yum!  Please open a location on Long Island, I think a location on Old Country Rd in Westbury would do fantastic, it's a very busy area and there's nothing like it on Long Island!","I've been coming here for just under 10 years for the lamb cumin noodles, I love the new store front location, I don't live in queens anymore but it's worth the drive from Long Island.  I wish they would bring back the lamb skewers they started when they opened the new store front, BUT it would never keep me from coming here. My favorite dish never changes, I come in for lunch and I take another order home for dinner!! Simply the best!","Finally ventured out to have the hand pulled noodles that have had a whole documentary published about it!  We ordered and grabbed a seat in the communal dining area . They gave us our drinks and we waited for a number to be called. Only beer and tea and soft drinks, no hard liquor or wine. Our number was called quickly and it is a relaxed atmosphere. So the noodles ! the texture is pretty cool , thicker and with a nice chew than I've had before. The noodles are weighty enough to handle a heavy dose of chili's in the 'standard spicy' (there is a nice cartoon chart and you can order the level of spice you want). Standard spicy was a bit too spicy for what I consider 'American spicy' but it was still hard to stop eating these flavor packed noodles. Next time we would Choose milder to allow the lamb flavor to shine through more. Worth a check out even if you like not spicy because they have that !",Xian Famous Foods
351,"So my family and I always go out for Sunday brunch. I stopped by this place yesterday and an extremely nice bartender showed me the brunch menu and by his attitude and the variety on the menu I decided we would come to brunch here. So all 4 people at my table got the food they ordered, I told them to eat because I don't want any bodies food getting cold. About 10 minutes later my mom asked the waitress if my food was ready... she said...""yes they rang the bell but I haven't gone back yet"" are you serious?!? My whole table is eating but you don't think you should get my food when they ring the bell?! She brought it out and it was cold but whatever. At this point I just ate it. I don't send my food back at restaurants. Oh and they add tip to the bill. Which is funny bc I've been here plenty of time beforeFor dinner and they have never added the tip to my bill. (The bill has always been over $100) The waitress was not good at all. They need to rethink their service they have. Maybe if she would've apologized for the lack of her service, my review would've been different.","I don't recommend hamburgers in that place - we ordered midium and midium rare - both were well done , for one appetizer , 2 burgers and beers we paid 65$",I came here recently. Didn't like the atmosphere at all. Was very dirty and the service sucks.,"Nice little spot with good food n drinks, great friendly service, and good prices.Our bartender/server was Adam and he was great! He gave good suggestions, very friendly, and just the right amount of attentiveness.They have daily happy hour til 7 (or 8) I can't remember which. Food: Wings and quesadillas are part of happy hour for $8 each and they are really tasty. The truffle fries was also on the happy hour menu for $6 and the portion is pretty big. We also got the chicken nachos which were so bomb.Drinks: I got a pineapple Moscow mule (and yes it's in the copper mug!) $9 and a jalapeño margarita ($7 during happy hour). Both drinks were good! My friend had a bay breeze which she said was good too $9. First time here but definitely not my last. I'll be back! (Terminator voice lol)","Went here last night for apps and drinks after reading a few reviews. It's no BS, this place is super chill, great service and great food. The wings were incredible and the margaritas are nice and strong. $6-7 happy hour drinks, $6-$8 apps are a sweet deal. Our server was kind, accommodating and so we added a few extra dollars on the tip. My only request is that they move closer to where I live on Broadway and Halsey, we need places like this.","This is probably my favorite bar/restaurant in the area. The service is prompt! My waiter/bartender, Yaw, was able to give me some great guidance and was very helpful. Everything on the menu is tasty! Don't skip dessert! The tiramisu is to die for. 5/5 for me :)",The Factory Bar & Restaurant
352,"I've had the lamb dish twice, and honestly can't say I really enjoy it that much. Even though this is their most famous dish and is covered with cumin and other spices, the meat was a bit dry and tough. I would encourage you to read Dan Z.'s review below for a more detailed analysis.The rest of the dishes here are average - good, but nothing to write home about and probably not worth going out of your way for.","Alas, the only thing that I recommend are the fried fish...even then, I'd recommend peeling off the thick layers of breading before getting to the fish.Must get: fried fishMeh: muslin lamb chops, eggplant, soupMissed: I don't knowI wanted to take my parents to a nice authentic Chinese restaurant when we were meeting up in Flushing, and after reading so many rave reviews about this muslin lamb, I knew that I had to come. Just to be clear, the muslin lamb is nothing spectacular, and the spices barely made much of an impact to the existing meat, which was a bit...odd tasting to me. My favorite was actually the fried fish, but even then, it was too breaded for my taste. The other smaller dishes, whether it's the cold apps (cucumber or clear rice noodles) or eggplant or chicken dishes were on par with local fares in your average Chinese takeout joints. With the amount of effort to get parking, yelp reviews, I think Fu Run Dong Bei just does not deliver.Food: 2 starsPrice: 2 starsService: 2 starsAmbiance: 2 stars","I have been thinking about this place for quite a while. We ordered the Chicken Stew with Mushroom and Muslin Lamb Chop. I would say, for the first one, the chicken is dry, the kind of mushroom this dish normally has and the soup is tasteless. Bad. The lamb chop looks appealing, however, the lamb is also too dry. Besides, their dishes is too plain, need a little bit more salt. At last, which is the main reason for one star, their SERVICE is SO BAD. The waiter kept bothering us and tried to enforce use to order dishes we didn't want. Besides, the waiters and waitresses even have a quarrel when all other customers are around. This made both me and my friend really uncomfortable.NOT COMING BACK.","Excellent Chinese food in Flushing. Fu Run is a quaint place that is no-frills they even have a lazy susan on the table, which is perfect for sending all those dished around to sample. Whether you live in NYC or visiting, Fu Run is a must-have! The delivery is even great, they are consistent and delish, I'm so happy my bf got me hooked on Fu Run. The dishes I love are the shrimp/pork fried rice, Muslim lamb chops, sizzling beef, shredded pork in hot fresh peppers, pork lo mein, shrimp, keek, & pork dumplings, scallion pancakes, chicken w. cashew nuts, and chicken and broccoli!","I came here with a group of people and we shared a lot of platters. The Green Bean Sheet Jelly with Sesame Sauce wasn't that great to start and the stir fried sour cabbage with pork and vermicelli wasn't that great either. The servers were not attentive, we had to ask frequently for rice, which is included in the meal but they didn't bring it, tea and anything we needed, they only gave us one paper napkin each. They also said that it was going to take too much time to make desserts for all of us, we were 10 people. The restaurant was half way empty and the sour cabbage took forever, so bit of a contradiction there. The good stuff: The scallion pancakes, braised pork belly, chinese watercrest in garlic sauce, crispy sliced fish with chili pepper and cumin, beef with vegetables, triple delight veggies, fried fish in red bean paste were all delicious!I wasn't crazy about the Muslim lamp chops and  the lamb and carrot dumplings.","Review is for the lamb and the pork and vermicelli sour soup.The vermicelli soup had a good zing. This had a savory broth flavor, paired with vinegar and cilantro. There's also a variety of ingredients that come together well - pork belly (pork belly is having a moment, huh?), napa, vermicelli, fried tofu. This item was a 4.5/5.The highly recommended lamb ribs were a little underwhelming. The dry rub was good, and the meat was of good quality. There were some issues in the preparation. The cook itself was rushed, so that the fat wasn't rendered well -- they pulled and make the meat difficult to bite off (compare with well made lechon or beef rib, but the fat is crispy and melty. The finish was also rushed: the finishing dry rub was good, as I mentioned, but the sesames on the crust were burnt as a result of a careless char. This item was a 2/5, with an easy improvement to 3.5 by either not burning or just removing the burnt seed layer, and a further improvement to 4.5 by slow cooking to wholly render the fat and connective tissue.",Fu Run Dong Bei
353,"I had the BBQ sea bass, split a grilled branzino, and it was alright. Nothing too special, but flavorful nonetheless. The babaganoush was also tasty as a side. The food is fairly priced and was a decent meal.",We decided to go there only due to the fact they opened earlier then the other restaurants we wanted to go . The place is spacious and cute . Waiter was very attentive. Unfortunately the baker I guess was not clean at all he continued to shake a waiters hand and still kept cutting and rolling the dough to the tray . omg he opened the oven and made the dishes not one time did he thought let me sat this aside and cook or do this or that or wow wash my hands or even have gloves. I was disgusted however I was relieved when I knew they wasn't giving us those dough .they had some dough sat aside and plus I figured fire kills all germs. The mixed tangier was mostly few shrimps and mostly calamari that was basically cooked in marinara sauce and then baked in the oven just for presentation only. Would I go again no,"Sabry's changed my entire life. I am Egyptian and had my doubts going to try a real authentic cuisine close to my heart. My expectations were dramatically exceeded.I'd come here for breakfast, lunch and dinner, 365 days of the year. I would recommend this 10 stars out of 5!",The fish is always fresh. I especially like the bbq style. Don't be fooled by the name. It is not bbq with a lot of sauce. It is very simple but tasty. The bread is so fresh.The location is great. Many good bakeries nearby.,"This is really a 3 star review but the food was ok and the servers were cool. That's the saving grace to bring it back to a 4 star. One wanted fish, the other wanted to try something different. That's how we ended up eating seafood at a Egyptian place. The reviews were great and the food looked good but the experience were quite the opposite. The servers are cool - no doubt about it. The food was just mediocre. Well except the bread. The bread is awesome. Baked clams is just something I love when I see it on the menu. This version was good but it came out a bit burnt. We waited a long time for our seafood combo. A very long time. It's probably cause the kitchen was tiny. A whole lobster, shrimp, calamari, scallops, and a filet of fish. It tasted like the baked clams. For $50, it was totally worth it but it just didn't taste amazing. And we waited too damn long to eat.","Love it. Get the salmon with hot pita bread, rice and salad combo. With a ginger drink. Yummy yummy! Your tummy will enjoy it all. Parking is tough. But be patient. Eat in or takeout. Food is consistently good. The place is not fancy but good for date night. Clean and the service is friendly. Can't wait to return.",Sabry's
354,"Went here last Wednesday Aug 14 for dinner. Waiter took out drinks, bright me my drink in a chipped rim glass.  So much so if I could of cut myself. I told him I needed a new glass and took the Drink so abruptly, it spilled down my hand. He bought me a new drink and glass unapologetic but rather said the bartender makes the drinks.  Tried to order sushi rolls wrapped in cucumber Instead if rice, 5 dollars additional per roll because ""we use the whole cucumber "".  NO WHERE I have ever been has ever charged that.  When he bought the check over he said we are getting you another drink for the broken glass.  Drink never came.  He only wanted a good tip. We still have him 15 percent even though this place sucks.  Service and quality are mediocre. Eat somewhere Else.",I usually enjoy my time here great food and lovely atmosphere but today that was not the case. My daughter took me out today and wanted to pay the bill (she's 10). The bill comes to 31.57 now keep in mind I said my child was paying the bill. She used her child savings debit card. I see all money transactions in real time and it said she was charged 37.88.  Now this enraged me not that it was an extra 6 dollars and change because we would have tipped that and more anyway. I showed it to the Manager and waiter as soon as it happened and they literally did nothing to fix it or give her back her money. They gave me nothing but excuses and an empty apologies. They pretended to c all the company that provided them with the credit card Machine but I highly doubt that happened. I've never seen something so careless happen and a simple fix not be resolved. I will never return to this place again. For stealing money from a child and lying to my face about it. Let this be a lesson always check your bank app after using your card at this place or any place for that matter. You never know who's desperate enough for a few dollars.,"Went there for dinner and was not impressed with their overpriced sushi.  The service was pretty lousy our waiter did not check on us not even once. We had to ask the bus boy for soy sauce like really you just served sushi Mr . Waiter then we had to go inside and find him to get our check. I complained to the manager who seemed just as clueless since he didn't even attempt to do or say anything to make it better, not even take an item off or something.  Made me think if walking out was a better choice but I believe in karma so I didn't","My husband and I used to live on LI and I would go to their Woodbury location with him and with my friends. We loved the sushi and the upscale vibe of the restaurant.We were so happy when we moved to Forest Hills and saw that MoCA was here as well! When we moved in, they were still re-modeling the place. We dined here a few times since and we love what they did. The decor is even more beautiful than the Woodbury location! The waitstaff and hostess are very friendly and very knowledgeable. The sushi is always fresh and the cocktails are delicious. I love eating here outside in the summer. I especially love it because I am able to bring my dog. Come here for a solid sushi meal and an upscale/trendy vibe","We love Moca. Excellent food, there's options for everyone. Great atmosphere, decent service, kids friendly. Perfect option for birthdays or small celebrations.","Most of their Stars in my review are for decor and shmanciness. Very pretty place. Falls short on the food review, unfortunately.High-priced place, very elaborate decorations and seating arrangements. The only two employees that I encountered were very nice. So, their score takes a serious beating when they sold me filet mignon and delivered thinly-sliced ribeye steak. To make matters worse they drowned it in some kind of a teriyaki sauce which was not described on the menu. Obviously there was some kind of mixup, right? But, when I brought it to the attention of the server and manager, they both agreed that I got what I ordered even though I pointed to it on the menu and clearly describe how they served me ribeye. At the end of the day, my filet mignon-priced ribeye was not abundant enough to satisfy but everything else that showed up on a plate had a very nice presentation. That is all.",MoCA Asian Bistro
355,First and last time we will dine here. Food was extremely bland and all our soda drinks had a funny taste and were flat. Very disappointing experience.,"I live in a Polish neighborhood, yet embarrassingly know little about the cuisine...at least the authentic stuff. Hard to not notice this place on my block. There's a full armor suit right out front, poking at my curiosity. I'm in!I've eaten here a couple of times and ordered take out a few other times, trying something different on the menu each time. The prices are good. The portions are generous. The meat on their meat entrees are delish, though the sides aren't that desirable. Some pickled stuff. Some bland stuff. The beef tartare is one of my fave items. So fresh!! All in all, I do love this place. I'm deducting a star because I don't love their sides and that makes for a somewhat incomplete meal for me, but seriously, the meat here is bomb!","I've been here around 100 times the past 5 or so years. The dishes have always had pretty decent flavors and consistency. Could it use a little ""umphh!""? Absolutely. The hock roasted in beer, I'm my opinion, could use some sauce. The pickled ingredients used to be so well balanced!!The bad part: There was one server in particular that would literally sit down and check on other Polish patrons instead of checking on others too. It was ridiculous and many times I held my tongue from asking what the hell her problem was with us. Just because my fiancé and I are not polish doesn't mean we should be waited on equally. There has been another server hired around the last 6mo. and she is fantastic. I was so happy to simply be checked on once before the end of our meal. I give it 4 stars because I don't think that the server should ruin it for such a great place.","I don't normally go out of my way to say a restaurant changed someone's life.  But in this case, after our visit we brought a large helping of extras to my Polish grandmother, age 102, who was previously rejecting food at a nursing home.  Having some authentic, delicious food from Okrasa (new name for this restaurant) got her sitting up and out of bed all day for our next visit.  We had fun, the great-grandkids had fun, and I especially enjoyed the Polish borscht.","This was my first time trying polish food and now i am thinking to myself why the hell did it take me 33 years to do so? As i walked in i thought the place was a nice decor. Very polish. They have an open kitchen where i walked by and saw all older women in there working. That was definitely a good sign. I ordered a bunch of different things to see what everything was all over about. The pirogies, potato pancakes with smoked salmon were a definite hit. But my favorite of the appetizers hands down was the tartare. When it came out it didnt look as good as it tasted. From the look of it, it looked bland but it was packed with flavor. The only complaint about that dish was that the bread was not toasted. I prefer toast points like at a french restaurant. But uuvpfl that was just my preference. My friends all enjoyed their 7dinner umeals as well. Oh em gee get the bacon! It's delish. As for the ghoulash i ordered which the waitress recommended. I found it to be on the bland side.

356,This place was right down the street from my apt and it is to die for. Food was so tasty and so affordable. Wish I had more seating inside though!,Understood why it was 5 stars when i had their jerk chicken. Normally i don't really write reviews but this one deserve legit 5 stars,This place is the f*&!!king bomb. Jerk chicken is off the chain. Staff very hospitable.,"My boyfriend and I found this gem in Brooklyn that had some darn good soul food. We both had ribs, but he had the BBQ ribs which were perfectly cooked.  I had the jerk ribs, they had a good kick to it. They ran out of the Mac and cheese (since it's so popular), but we had some candied yams and veggies. (JUST AS GOOD) We will definitely be back for some Mac and cheese","It's been FOREVER since I've been to a soul food spot in Brooklyn And was like ""this is it""Came here 12 on the dot (as soon as they opened) and had a fried fish meal with two sides. Yams and Mac and cheese cause that's what true southerners eat! Fish was fresh out some piping hot oil. Wait, let me back up. The CORNBREAD! Chile! So good I asked for two (and I'm supposed to stay away from carbs but mind y'all business). Fast forward. So I received my meal. My biggest critique with yams is 1 of 2 things 1) they're not sweet enough 2) they're two sweet. I know, very thin line. But when you know, you know. They're yams are PERFECT! The Mac and cheese is real ""my grand momma said dinner ready"" Mac and cheese. The fish is fried like your classic black folk fish fry in the south. OHHHHHHHHH and they had kool aid y'all! Listen, I don't indulge like this normally. Maybe twice a year. I gotta keep telling myself ""girl don't go back before you start rolling down the street instead of walking"". The kool aid was black folk kool aid forreal. Not too sugary either. JUST RIGHT. I'm assuming they're family owned but they're a cool staff. That food though? A1. And now I know why they have a perfect 5 star rating on yelp.  Like I always say, I love when Yelp doesn't disappoint. Y'all were spot on with this spot man!","Yesterday, I and some of my family members went to this great restaurant in Brooklyn called A Taste of Heaven, which I found by simply googling ""soul food restaurants in Brooklyn"".

I had the Rosemary Chicken with macaroni and peas and rice as my two sides, and my cousin had the Ox Tails with the peas & rice and macaroni as his two sides. I forgot what my uncle had, but it was obviously delicious, as he scraped is dish clean. The proprietors, Melody, Tony, as well as Tyrone and the rest of the amazing staff treat you as if you are family and truly made the trip to the restaurant worthwhile (mind you, I live nowhere near it). If you have time, this is a hiddengem that needs to be checked out! It is SO worth the trip to Brooklyn. Also, a block away, they have some of the most beautiful murals I've seen.",Taste of Heaven
357,"I dislike this 99 in Flushing. I've been to all 99 restaurants, two in the city, one in Brooklyn. From what I can remember, this is the worst. Prior to this visit, I called them to make a reservation (a party of 8) and asked them to give us a table that has 8 individual pots plus 2 grills because of my family has different diet restrictions that we needed to grill the food separately. I triple confirmed with her on the phone and she said yes, that's not a problem. When we arrived there, they gave us a table with only 6 pots and 1 grill. They first told us that they didn't have such a table with 8 individual pots and 2 grills. Then I mentioned the phone conversation I had with them previously, I started to get angry then the host said ""ok, we will give you a table upstairs that it has 8 pots and 2 grills."" I was like, seriously? Why didn't you give us that table at the very first place? I was very annoyed by that. The servers were extremely busy that we didn't get to have a glass of water until after half an hour we were seated. And they never refilled our water. It also took a long time for them to take our order. The ventilation was terrible. Once I walked into the restaurant, I felt like the air was unbreathable. I understand that it's inevitable to get your clothes stink eating at a barbecue or hotpot restaurant. But this time was definitely the worst. Even my plastic watch smelt like barbecue the day after eating there. Food wasn't that great as what I remembered from the other 99 restaurants. Barbecue food (the server cooked for us) was over cooked especially the seafood. All in all, I won't go there again.","The restaurant has a good ambiance and we had the hot pot buffet and it was good, but the seafood pancake was below par.",Dinner was ok...until they ran out of water. Then the thought of raw meat and the cooks preparing not using water to wash their hands made my stomach queasy. By the end of dinner the water came on. Parking is horrendous the restaurant is on a narrow busy one way street.,"Nice set ups for hotpots. The broth pot for cooking is tucked away under the table, providing more real-estate for the tabletops. Excellent idea.The cooking stove is very fast and controllable. Very suitable for this usage and made the experience great.Waiter was attentive and helpful.Meats and vegetables were fresh; especially the shrimps.Price is a little high, at $23 a head, even though it's all you can eat; perhaps, have an option for one refill at a lower price. Not all customers want to stuff themselves.","Love this place. We come here almost every other weekend. Food quality isn't the best but the variety is good. The beef is always too fatty and they always give you less than you ask for but they rarely give you a hard time for ordering more. The sauce station was great, selection was amazing. There're at least one sweet soup there so it's good for refreshing. The free ice cream is a perfect touch at the end. We always leave feeling full and happy.","As many reviews have stated you get a free birthday meal 3 days before or after your birthday with a minimum of 3 other people or come on your actually birthday by yourself and it will be free.I love the option of having individual pots, it allows everyone to have their soup base how they want it: spicy, tomato,  pork bones or chinese herbs. Hot pot is all about socializing. As long as you are in good company,  you will have a good time. Everything tasted fresh from the beef, lamb, fish to the vegetables. My favorites were the pumpkin and corn. These were extremely sweet and fresh. Only complaint is the sauce station, might need to have someone there cleaning up the dropping and changing spoons. Other than that I loved it!",99 Favor Taste
358,"Sooooo, my husband just came went in here about 15 minutes ago and he was approached by a man who works here asking ""what do you need"" , not hi how are you, how can I help you.....then when he said he wanted a few pastries the man told him ""go next door!"" And walks away....he goes next door to the bakery side and there is a lady cleaning, no acknowledgment. He stands there for a few minutes and then just leaves......We get pastries here all the time but will not be any longer. That's not how you treat customers!!!!! Rude AF! ByeeeeToo many good Greek pastry shops in Astoria to be treated like that!","I came for a bridal shower and was so excited for some Greek food! Appetizers came out and everything was great! The problem was when the main courses came out. ALL of the waiters were confused and confused everyone's orders, even though they had written them down. People at my table did not get their orders correct the first, second, or third time around. Then the head waiter, I believe, promised those people an extra plate of sides... and never came back. They never cleared the plates from the main course and started serving the cake. Where were we suppose to put it? Kind of disappointed.",This was always the go to spot for greek pastries for as long as I can remember. Moving forward to my last 2 recent experiences. The first was I went in got 2 pieces of galaxtoburiko  foe me and my wife always my favorite got home opened up and began eating it and it was just not good very bland and i was so shocked and upset because they have never let me down in the past I threw out the rest and 2nd piece. 1 week later decided let me give them another shot this time I'll switch it up and get couple pieces of cheesecake.  Okay about five steps in the door younger kid almost running  up to me and says what do you want said I want to get some pastries and he says okay you have to go next door. I'm like okay even though the items I want are on this side of the business I still go next door. I patiently wait next door for a while no one helping or acknowledging me with nothing that I want in this section to begin with. Needless to say I walked out very upset and will not be back. Plenty of other places in Astoria that want my business than to deal with this.,Amazing food AMAZING service all of the servers are so attentive and so nice and its kids friendly!! So underrated,"Victory Garden Cafe is a Greek-run cafe and restaurant in Astoria.  I came to watch a Panathinaikos game on tv, which they were playing on a tv above the main counter.  Service was efficient and polite. The Greek eggs breakfast was solidly good. Basically it's scrambled eggs with tomato and onion.  It comes with toast and fries.  I got a side of bacon with it.  I enjoyed the whole meal. Especially considering that they play Greek soccer games, I'll definitely be back!","My first bridal shower was hosted here over the weekend! The staff was very friendly and was there whenever we needed anything. I loved the atmosphere and how everything was decorated, it was adorable. We had a really nice time and I couldn't be happier with how everything turned out! Would recommend to anyone!",Victory Garden Cafe
359,"I was really looking forward to the fried calamari based off these photos, but mine was chewy and mushy. No crisp whatsoever. The bifteki tasted good but came in a puddle of its own grease and juices. Disgusting way to serve burger meat and veggies, they should have let it rest/drain before tossing it in the container. The lemon potatoes were the only saving grace.","Ok so I'm part Greek so maybe I have higher expectations, but I find this place to be OK.  It's really the only Greek place that will deliver to me so I have no other choices unless I go out.  I don't find anything to be particularly spectacular to be honest... and some dishes are pretty disappointing.  I am a big fan of Avgolemono soup.  I sort of use it as a benchmark for any Greek restaurant.  It's not good at all and completely loaded with salt.  Their souvlaki is OK... the rice kinda sucks as does the tzatziki.  The lemon potatoes are almost good, but I wouldn't write home about them.  Many better Greek places to go to for sure.I'd really give them 2 stars, but I'm curving it up to account for my standards.","Came here with my friend for dinner since it was close to the airport.  Had good reviews and a big parking lot.  That's already a huge plus in my book.It was around 6:30 or so, and there was one table in the back with 4 ladies, and the rest of the place was empty.  Not a good sign, but hey it's more or less the beginning of dinner service and it's a Thursday afterall.  No worries.Water came pretty quickly and so did warm pita with olive oil and balsamic.  The silverware and plates were a bit on the dirty side though.Ordered a large greek salad, greek sausage, grilled octopus and a chick souvlaki sandwich.The salad was okay, some of the greens should have been picked out...  The sausage and sandwich were fine.  The octopus is my major complaint.  It was diced up octopus with a bunch of onions.  Not really what I would expect for $17.  I expected the normal big 2 or 3 octopus tentacles.  But no, I was highly disappointed.  Not only that, but the octopus itself, it had this grainy texture and well tasted absolutely bland.  I was actually surprised that other reviews mention the freshness of the octopus, because this was definitely not the case for me.  It was so bad we actually asked the waitress if the octopus was fresh or frozen, yes we tried to Gordan Ramsey them.  The waitress said that is was fresh and walked away.Additionally the service was not that great, there were only 2 tables, and the waitress failed to refill water, failed to check in on us regarding the food.If I lived close by, I would not come here let alone actually drive here.  There are obviously far better options for Greek food in the area.",This is my favorite Greek place in the neighborhood. What a find! Such great hospitality and quality food. Everyone was so kind! We ordered so much food and were completely satisfied. TO GET:-Octopus-Lemon potatoes-Grilled whole fish-Greek saladGREAT:-Family run business-Parking!TO DO:-Try everything!!! It was so good!WOULD I GO AGAIN?-Yessssssssss,"3.5 stars so I'm giving a courtesy 1/2 star because of the quality of the food. We popped I here for a week day lunch and nobody was in there. The server came over threw the menus at us and we began to contemplate. I had the avgolemono soup and an appetizer order of the keftedes. My husband had the soup too and the chicken souvlaki sandwich. The soup came out piping hot in the flash of an eye. Delish! As good as my yiayia's. The meatballs were light and airy, the needed a touch of salt and we're missing something, so I put a touch of tzatziki on them and it really brought them to life. My husband ordered his  souvlaki and asked them to add fries to the sandwich and thy happy obliged. The food was really good if it wasn't for for service my review would have been a strong 4 stars but the friendliness of the server was a little lack long although he warmed up slightly toward the end. I'll be back for another meal!",So lucky we found this place. Unassuming location in shopping center.  Great parking however. Sylvie was our server and she was sweet and funny and helpful and always around.  We didn't want for anything. Grilled octopus was good.  A bit pricey at $19 and not a huge piece. Spicy feta dip is excellent with warm pita bread. The olive oil and pita is good too. Saganaki is wonderful and salty and deliciously fried golden brown. Horiatiki salad would be perfect with less onions. Grilled shrimp was tasty.  Combo platter of gyro (good and moist) and chicken souvlaki also delicious.  Lemon potatoes a bit dry. But fries were really yummy.  Tzatziki is just right. We had Greek red and White House wine too. And delicious galaktobouriko (needed a drizzle of honey) and yogurt with cherries. Greek coffee and it was a nice dinner.  They didn't rush us at all. We felt very welcomed and we will return. Thanks Sylvie!,Plaka
360,"Horrible service. Everything was fine at the beginning when we came in and we were seated very quick. We were a party of nine people (4 kids and 5 adults, two of us under 21). We were given menus, drink menus and water, everything good. They gave my aunt and mom wine samples and we ordered food and drinks, two different checks. I asked my mom to order me a piña colada, and she asked our waitress (I believe her name is Claudia) for one and she didn't ask if with alcohol or not, which was a bit weird because whenever we go out somewhere to a place with drinks and around children, the waiters usually ask. Anyways, we got it and it was FULL of alcohol, I couldn't drink it because I'm 18, so we asked Claudia to bring a virgin piña colada. That's when she got all defensive and trying to blame it on my mom. My mom just asked her to take this one back and make one without alcohol, the waitress passive aggressively said okay and left. She came back, and we gave the alcoholic one back to the waitress. The wait for food is horrendous. We waited over an hour for our food, by then everyone was pretty much frustrated and ready to leave. I'm only giving it two stars because the food was good and the mariachi was great, if it weren't for those two, this place would get a big fat ONE STAR. We got the checks at the end and noticed how Claudia charged us for TWO piña coladas, the alcoholic one we sent back. We notified her, and she said that wasn't her problem, basically telling us we are being charged for not drinking something? We gave her the alcoholic one back, so why are we being charged??? She was just being rude to my mom, that's when we told the manager or supervisor and he took it off the bill. Also, my aunt gave her debit card to Claudia, and she wouldn't give it back to my aunt without my mom paying first, but she was gonna pay cash??? My aunt then said fine, that she would report her debit card stolen, that's when Claudia ran to get her debit card back. I just don't understand how such lovely place has such HORRIBLE staff.","THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.I was really looking forward to trying the food due to the great reviews, but the awful service I experienced completely ruined any hopes I had of this restaurant.My experience on 6/29:I ordered two orders of tacos and a side of corn for delivery around 8:10pm from their online Wix website. A few minutes after I ordered, I called to make sure that the order had gone through and they confirmed that it had. I normally order delivery off of Seamless, but for some reason it had them listed as closed (even though they close at midnight).Around 9:30pm, I called wondering where my order was because it had been nearly an hour and a half of waiting. They told me that the order was already on its way, so I thought it would be another 10-15 minute wait since I don't live that far from them.After another half hour of waiting, I attempted to call multiple times to ask what was going on with my order, but no matter how many times I dialed, the calls would not go through. I started getting concerned and frustrated (and hangry)...so much so that I even tried to call a Lyft to drive me to the restaurant. I was getting no response, and I was starting to feel helpless.But right before my Lyft driver arrived, the delivery guy called. It was 10:15pm. More than TWO hours after placing the order!! I really wanted to like this place, but based on this experience, I doubt I'll ever order again.","I've ordered from this place a few times, and the food has been good, however my most recent order was the last.I placed a rather sizable order for delivery and from previous experience, a wait time was to be expected. I also understand that weekends are normally busy, but it should not take over an hour and a half to deliver to a location less than 10 blocks away, on the same avenue mind you. Turns out the deliver person was given the wrong address. I suppose it can't be helped since the place always has very loud music blasting in the background when I call.Worst part of all of this was once I finally received my order, there was an order missing. So, I called to let them know I had a missing order and the person on the phone told me that everything I ordered was in the bags. I explained that there isn't anything else left in the bag in front of me, and she insisted that all the food was placed in the bags.So, this woman on the phone is essentially doing a few things to me:she's calling me a liar, and she's stealing from me. Eventually, after thoroughly explaining a few more times that my order is missing, she said that they're bringing me another order. Unfortunately, the order was never delivered. In addition to calling me a liar and stealing from me, in the end I was lied to as well.I've never had a problem ordering from this place. I've ordered from this place several times, since they're so close to where I live, and they have good food, but why on earth would I go out of my way to lie about something like this, after ordering from them in the past and waiting an hour and a half for my food. I was really hoping for a positive turnout, but the situation was handled extremely poorly. Apparently, an appetizer is worth more to this place than losing a customer forever. Safe to say, I will never be ordering from them again.Fair warning to people who order from this place; you'd better hope they take your address down correctly, and that your order isn't missing anything, because you won't be getting your delivery in a timely manner or a replacement for your missing food.","I usually don't review on the first visit but this was an exceptional experience.   King of Tacos had been here for a while and I odds it all the time but never been.  Maybe cause it's always packed.  Good sign but I don't like to wait. To start we hit the queso fundido with chorizo,  shrimp emerador, and the guacamole.   The queso fundido was spectacular I could not hey enough.   It comes with bread and these large very thin tortillas for dipping.   It's a must.   The shrimp emperor was like a warm ceviche, limey and spicy.  Another home ruin. Three guacamole was probably the best I've ever had, and they give you enough chips you don't have top ask for more.   Nuff said. For our main we got the 10 taco tray.  You cam pick up to 3 different meats.   For 5 if it's it was more than enough.   We're got chorizo, steak and al pastor.   Again very good tasty.   It's in three tower with all the fixings on the top.   Very nice unique presentation.To top it all off the service was very very good.   Water was always filled and our waitresses Elena was not ever very far away and checked on us often.   We got a visit from the manager Alex at least twice.   He even took our dessert order after I raved to him how much I liked it here.   I'll be back again every time I'm in the mood for quality mex food.  So instead of walking Northern Blvd I'll go one block north top 31st Avenue.  King of Tacos is my new go to place for Mexican hood. I'm sending everyone there and I recommend that toy go there to.   You will not be disappointed. Amidst forgot they have mariachi on the weekends.   At least when we were there on Saturday. Can't wait to go back next week",Is it possible to rate a place 6 stars?!?! King of Tacos is definitely worth all the hype. We often times drive by this restaurant and see how many people are here that we had to give it a try ourselves! First I have to shout out Elena! She was an amazing waitress who gave us the best recommendation on food and had the sweetest personality. Must haves: Chorizo queso fundido- one of the best queso fundido I've have in the neighborhood by far. The tacos were also amazing! Just wish we had room for more. We ordered the platter of ten tacos for 4 people and that was just enough with all of our appetizers. There was a live singer walking around singing request- he is also the lead singer of the mariachi band that do shows on Friday's and sundays. Another huge huge shout out to the manager Alex who was the nicest! When we ordered dessert he presented us with a platter of samples. Of course we ate it all! Everything we ate was phenomenal and I can't wait to go back!,"A m a z i n g Mexican food! I've been wanting to try this place for a very long time and decided to tonight. The staff and chefs really know what they are doing, especially Alex ! Really great hospitality and really great food. For apps we got the corn and guac. To die for. I know good guac when I taste it.. this one was one of the best! A little spicy and super fresh. The Mexican corn was also to die for.. a little acidic and just perfect. For entrees we ordered pulpo (octopus) tacos, carnitas tacos and the al pastor tacos. I LOVE tacos and these are some of the best I've had. I will say, I think the pastor tacos WERE the best I've had. They were literally perfection.... I'd order six of them if I could and eat them all in one shot. The happy hour specials are amazing as well. Monday through Thursday happy hour specials on sangria, margs, pina coladas, beers.... etc. such a good deal! This is my new spot for sure !",The King Of Taco
361,Order from this place all the time.Food is always fresh.Everyday different menu.Customer service is incredible.Staff is very friendly!Best food hands down in all of queens.,"They definitely play favoritism I work in the area and everytime I order from the place there's ALWAYS something wrong with my order ALWAYS but yet it's my fault!!! Always forgetting shit and charging me for it! Their lunch speacials are hit or miss but mostly MISS! I never had a problem before with this place but lately the have just been really horrible and I'm staring to think it's on purpose!!! I didn't bring any lunch today so rosa and I tried to order form here so she placed the order and said to the girl it's going on a card she said she'll call back and never called back. So rosa called again to pay with the card and the guy said that they're short handed and one of the cars broke down that they don't know when they're going to deliver and they don't know the total, fine. So I called them back and told them to cancel the order since they don't know anything she says to me ""cancel the order? It was already made hun"" which by the way I hate being called ""hun"" I'm like how is it already made when you guys just said that you don't have a total for us and the drivers car broke down and you're short handed?? So fine rosa finally was able to give them the card and pay for it. The delivery came I Just ordered chicken fingers... it comes raw every single piece was stale and inedible!!! I called them the manager comes on the phone like ""oh really?  I would like to see that. I'll have someone give you your money back and send you chicken fingers blah blah blah but it seems like everytime rosa order and idk if it's you too that we always have issues.. I have repetitive customers blah blah blah"" and I'm like how is it MY FAULT that I got raw chicken fingers and ordered a burger and you guys tell me it doesn't come with lettuce and tomatoes because people can be allergic?? ""We're not a burger joint"" SO WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU SELLING BURGERS?! Ive never gone to any place and they don't put lettuce or tomoates on a burger just Incase people are ""allergic"" if you guys were so worried about people being allergic to it you would warn everyone if they had any allergiesBut then I ordered bacon on my burger but guess what you guys forgot that too!! ""So then he tells me that we don't need to order from them anymore they appreciate our business but we don't need to order from them""I basically hung up the phone on him because I felt like saying threatening  things. so now I'm $7 short no fucking food and fucking angry as all fucking hell I feel like going there after work and fucking cursing them the FUCK OUT!!! And throwing their STALE RAW ASS CHICKEN IN THEIR FACES!Initially I had absolutely NO problems with this place when the issues started I was laughing it off and just making jokes about it with my co workers then it started to get ridiculous. I think it's REALLY unfair that I had to be inconvenienced CONSTANTLY and btw half of the time I didn't even bother to call I just stayed away from them for a bit. Literally so pissed off about this I really felt like doing something crazy. But regardless if you're not me then your food might come out fine I guess they're just racist against black people specifically me idk.",Love this place. Just wish they'd change the Met to the Yankee or anything else. I get upset every time I order it but it's just so damn good that I have to live with it,I did a catering order for 45 people and the food was excellent.  Everyone said how delicious it was.  They were great to work with and everything was perfect.  Highly recommend!,Now this place is my fav place in Queens so far . Very fresh ingredients ! I had godfather and Now thats Italian . The fresh Mozzarella is super great and Chicken cutlet is not greasy ! you will never regret. Was a satisfied  lunch,"Huge selection of prepared food.  I have never had a bad meal out is the place.  Really good food, and the staff is always polite.",Benateri's Italian Gourmet Deli
362,The manager is incredibly rude. Kept on hanging up and cursing at me over the phone for no reason. Won't be going here or ordering here anymore.,"This ain't it, chief.I'll pass on the food but will go for a drink or two.","Hate to do it but if I find a hair in my grilled chicken wrap I will have no choice but to drop the 1 star hammer. Also, I ordered my wrap to exclude tomatoes. The wrap came with hair and tomatoes included. Can I give less than 1 star??","First visit to Woodbine's was awesome. Party of 4, we took a table in the back. I ordered a draft beer. So did everyone else. For food, turns out, we just wanted to share several apps. Started with an order of wings tossed in cashew scallion teriyaki sauce. Big, fresh, tasty wings, sauce was outstanding. Went through half a stack of napkins. Totally worth it. Next, spinach artichoke dip. Consistency was perfect for scooping. We asked for more pita chips and the second batch came out hot and crispy. I alternated nibbles of scotch egg. A little more hard-boiled than I expected, still enjoyable, with a somewhat McNuggety finish. Prices were reasonable, fair even, considering the location. I will happily return for a happy hour sometime. Cheers.","We live in the neighborhood and Woodbines is our go-to spot. Decent beer selection, usually at least one but often times a few local brewery options. Elevated bar food that you pay more for but it doesn't make you want to die afterwards. Love brunch here, too. Music is great when Alston is behind the bar (he's also an awesome bartender and super friendly but not in a ""Can I interest you in some jalapeño poppers?!?!""-way). I'm vegetarian so always get the Beyond Burger with Parmesan truffle fries. Not a TON of other options for our folk but the burger is legit enough that I don't even look to order anything else. Not sure if they're still doing this, but I had a mimosa flight for brunch once that was REAL GOOD. There's one waitress who I cringe if I walk in and see her but other than that, awesome!","The lunch special is great! We both ordered the crispy chicken sandwich-generous portion of perfectly crisp and juicy chicken, a nice chipotle spread, and yummy buns. The fries and salad were both good, though I would probably stick to the fries next time. We added on the soup of the day-butternut squash- and it hit the spot. I also liked that one of my favorite beers (flower power) was on draft, $3 for a 10oz pour. The menu is interesting, mostly bar food but with some sophisticated twists (the lamb burger was very tempting). Pretty busy spot even in the middle of a weekday, great vibe and service. Can't wait to go back!",Woodbines
363,Pros:+ Decent bagel options+ Rainbow bagels - beautiful for that instagram postCons:- Pricey- Long lines- Unfriendly staff that does rush you- Limited parking options,"This place has bangin bagels. Usually a long line but overall worth it, plus they're on Uber eats","This is really a 3.5 review. Their bagels are good, one of the better bagels I've had in the area. I don't know that I would tell you to come out of your way for it though. The bagels are little small sometimes, but their pastrami smoked salmon is on point. My main gripe is the cream cheese stinginess! Ask for extra, they don't give a normal amount, it's just a smattering instead of a shmear. Macaroni salad was good!Mornings are crazy, the lines can be hectic and snake around the store, but it does move fairly fast.","Hands down, really the best place for bagels!! No matter the time of day, the bagels are always fresh!!! You know a place is good when you crave it  often!!!Only downfall is the wait time....it's pretty impossible to go in there and wait less than a half hour so you really have to be patient or really want to eat their bagels. Suggestion: have a separate line for those people who only want a dozen bagels, coffee, etc.","Hands down, really the best place for bagels!! No matter the time of day, the bagels are always fresh!!! You know a place is good when you crave it so often!!!","Very clean and open layout that let's you see everything going on with a staff that's always friendly and attentive. There can be long lines which means a wait, but there's a reason, their food is just that good!  There are so many options from bagels and sandwiches to freshly baked goods and plenty of drinks in the fridge. Best bagel place in Queens, I'd bet money on that statement.",Utopia Bagels

I came with several people to enjoy the food and practice our Spanish. Maria was our server and she took great care of us (ask for her section!). I ordered the red snapper and was completely blown away by the generous portion, so tender and flavorful. It was served with some wonderful Cuban black beans and rice & a mango relish. I couldn't get the wonderful red snapper out of my mind, so I went back the next week and had the same thing again! My husband enjoyed the macadamia crusted fish very much, too.  Thanks so much!","I truly enjoyed everything about Madera Cuban Grill. First of all, I would love to say that I picked this place but that honor goes to my good friend who use to work in the area. Honestly, I've never been to the area around Roosevelt Island but I definitely plan to make a return trip when the weather gets warmer. The views from the island are simply beautiful. Madera Cuban Grill is perhaps a hidden gem. Finding a great place to eat throughout NY and the burrows is not hard to do but it helps to have Yelp on your side or a good friend who enjoys fine dining just as much as you do. Madera Cuban Grill is located in the mist of town and if walk to fast, you might miss it. When you walk in, you immediately get the impression that it's run by a family or a group of people who take great pride in what they do. On this particular occasion, I was  with two of my compadres and we were seated right away. Our waiter was friendly and very efficient as he took our orders and gave us recommendation and answered our questions. After sitting and admiring the down home feel of the place, I could tell that this place is very popular based on the number of folks that flooded in from when we sat down. So we ordered a few drinks and appetizers that we certainly enjoyed. Our entrees were equally as fabulous. From the first bite I was sold. The food and appetizers has such great flavor and authenticity. Again, my experience was awesome and I can't wait to return very soon .",Madera Cuban Grill & Steakhouse
365,"My first time and very disappointed, they don't like to serve to people with swimwear, and I was one of them. They didn't seem to care, and sat my daughter and I.

And that it was close by. Turns out she was right. This place is 1 block or so away from Astoria pool. And the pizza was good. Since I was coming after swimming, I knew I wasn't going to go inside. Even if I was coming over at around 8:30pm and not during normal Astoria pool traffic. As suspected, there was a sign outside the door that said no swimmers basically. This is an FYI should you want to come in with pool outfits after the pool.  I sat outside on one of their outdoor dining tables & one of the waiters saw me right away. I ordered the bruschetta of the day with a 16 inch margarita pizza to go. Even had a glass of wine and some water during my wait. The margarita was really good. The sauce was flavorful and went well with the crust. The bruschetta of the day was tomato and mozzarella. You'll see in my pic that one of them turned over in the uber. Not the restaurant's fault. Although my bread did get soggy by the time I got home, the bruschetta was seasoned well. I ate the majority of it with a fork. I would recommend for delivery. I'll update this review if I ever sit down and have dinner there.","I went to this location mid-afternoon yesterday to get a late lunch before meeting a friend for happy hour. I had FANTASTIC service from a very attentive and kind server who kept my water glass full even as the dining room was very slow and I was eating slowly. I got a white pizza with fresh arugula at the end and a glass of prosecco. The prices were very reasonable, the prosecco was delicious to spread over the course of my meal, and I very much enjoyed the white pizza with arugula. I did feel like it was underseasoned--I know that they gave me shakers of dried garlic, dried oregano, parmesan, and hot pepper flakes, but it seems like an oversight to not have some seasoning involved in the baking of the pizza in the kitchen. As much as I enjoyed the pizza at the time (after seasoning it), it was pretty underwhelming when I got it home. I just don't totally trust pizza that doesn't taste good cold.That said, I enjoyed it a great deal! I just think a couple of small tweaks could improve the food. The service was excellent and I'd definitely come back the next time I'm in Astoria.",Palermo Restaurant & Bar
366,The way they make the Kofta kabab has changed. Maybe they have new owners. The rice is now yellow and overcooked.  They changed the onions and cabbage mix adding shredded carots.  The dish no longer has the original taste and style like when it first opened years ago. I am moving on to finding a new place to eat turkish food.,Changed the menu and salad that comes with grilled meat not very good. Some carrots and onions. Meat not as fresh and got a very weird baked rice pudding that I had to return. Sadly used to be my go-to.,"Would give no stars, owners have a very aggressive and poor attitude. Came here during a holiday to NYC hoping for a quick bite and no greeting and very aggressive employees and employee acquaintances. I walked in and literally got bumped by an employee and his friend got in my face saying that I'm being an idiot when he was clearly intoxicated for bumping into this friend (the employee). I would rather go to Manhattan and have halal guys cart again despite the distance rather than go here.Can't comment on food since my friends and I left but the employees (management included) have a very aggressive and poor attitude. (Learn from the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan and be responsible employees, not aggressive and rude)","I came here to try Turkish cuisine since I'll be flying out there later this year. The first thing I noticed were how friendly and happy the staff were. There is definitely a welcoming and homely vibe here which was very inviting. I spoke to the manager, Jasmine while I was waiting to pick up my food and she was really nice. Not only did she offer me some of her fruit (I might have caught her during her lunch break) but she also helped me narrow down the cities that I wanted to travel to while in Turkey. When I got home, the food was still hot and the quality of meat was great. I ordered the lamb dumplings and the findik pide. Needless, to say i can confirm that if you order takeout, it will still be good by the time it gets to house! I highly recommend and will definitely be back.",I go with my family Sunday night in turkish grill We have dinner  around 15 people Food was so good tasty very very good Service was so good place was probably clean  I recommend you go And try this food  was very goodWe definitely go back,"3.5 Stars but I'll round up to 4:It's been a few years since we've returned to Turkish Grill!  The restaurant hasn't really changed except the prices/portion sizes.  Prices have increased while portion sizes have decreased!   I know times are rough but if it ain't broke, don't fix it!!Here is our menu tonight:Mixed Appetizer - all delicious:~ Lebini (thick homemade yogurt w/walnuts, garlic and dill)~ Humus (mashed chick peas blended w/fresh garlic , tahini and herbs)~ Eggplant Salad (smoked eggplant w/peppers, onion, parsley, fresh dill and lemon juice)~ Tabuleh (bulgur wheat w/parsley, scallions and a touch of olive oil)~ Piyaz ( white beans w/onion, parsley with olive oil and vinaigrette dressing)~ Babaganush (smoked puree eggplant, sesame oil, lemon juice and a hint of garlic)Sigara Borek (light pastry dough stuffed w/a blend of feta cheese and fresh herbs) - this was disappointing.  I remember loving it in the past.  Not so much on this visit.Homemade Manti (Turkish style dumplings. A light dough stuffed w/seasoned, ground lamb and onions; steamed to perfection; served with garlic yogurt and special buttered tomato sauce) - this was the best dish of the night!  Delicious.Shish Kebab (Marinated baby lamb cubes grilled on skewers; Served w/rice, grilled peppers, tomatoes & seasoning) - l used to love this dish but this time it was a little overcooked.Dessert: Kunefe ( shredded wheat w.cheese homemade yogurt w/walnuts, garlic and dill) - soooo good!  This was actually a large portion!",Turkish Grill
367,"How on earth does this place have such good reviews?? Maybe this was an off night but jeez it was disappointing. Pizza arrived luke warm, sausage topping tasted and smelled like it was old or left out too long, and part of the order was missing. Restaurant apologized and had the missing food redelivered but it took a full 45 minutes to arrive from the original delivery time. Unfortunately the dish was not worth waiting for as it also tasted sour. I guess $55 is a small price to pay to never order from there again.",I don't understand. No one ever picks up the phone at this place. And delivery is horrible. My food was ordered at 4:13pm and it's now 5:53pm....,"Would not recommend ordering take out from this restaurant. One time I ordered delivery and they called me to get my order from the car. Last time I ordered the seafood black ink linguine, there were only a few pieces of calamari and mostly pasta - not worth it for the price!",I walked into this cute little restaurant and was immediately greeted by the lovely Diane. I believe she runs this place. She give me total Bobs burgers Linda vibes! Love her! She creates a very warm and friendly atmosphere. This restaurant does not serve alcohol however it's byob so you can bring your own alcoholic beverage of choice. Food is soooo fresh and delicious. I ordered the Caprino salad and my boyfriend ordered a chicken Parmigiana with a side of penne. Will def be coming back soon!,"Disclaimer: long post...Ahhh, 1st pizza stop in Queens, NY is Forno Pizzeria e Trattoria. It gets a . Located in Maspeth, Queens discretely situated on 69th street. If you drive too fast, you'll miss it. Yelp help me find it. *Yelp tip: always use the sorting filter ""MOST REVIEWED"" & pick from that list.* It's been a breakthrough in my / relationship w/YELP. The first bite was perfect, toasty, crisp on entry and soft on the inside. The pizza tasted so close to Napolitano style pizza, I had to find out the ingredients. Luckily, the Pizzaiolo was around so I approached him with questions; he revealed he uses a little oil, along with other pizza dough staples: flour, salt, yeast & water. However, NO sugar! Dough goes through a cold fermentation, followed by room temperature. I also asked if he uses a yeast starter since I've learned that many of my favorite pizza places use one. He said sometimes but mostly for making generic bread. Lastly, he asked me if I run a place and I said no:/ and explained I'm just a girl from Queens who lives in Tacoma, WA & out of the frustration of NOT finding good pizza, started making her own. The pizzaiolo lastly shared some pearls: use a stone and crank the oven temp to as high as it goes. Tips that have taken me about a year to learn. Forno Pizzeria e Trattoria understands the art of pizza making! Now, how do we get them a license to sell alcohol, because I sure would've liked a glass of sauvignon blanc with this pizza. Here's  the gist: Would I travel from Manhattan to Queens for this pizza? Nope, because you'll probably find just as good of pizza in the city, but if your in Queens and are in the mood for the personal pizza in a quaint little private spot as opposed to ""pizza by the slice"" experience, then YES go to Forno's. Welcome to Queens!pizzeriaforno.com",The people that work here are extremely kind and patient with us. The service was great and the food was also very delicious. Everything is made from scratch.,Forno Pizzeria E Trattoria
368,I went twice and it was quite inconsistent.The first time was seriously impressive from a creativity and flavor standpoint.The second time was not great. It seemed like the dishes were rushed and didn't taste that good.I hate inconsistency for restaurants in NYC. There are too many sure options to waste $60 on a failed experiment.,Yo this place is so fire. The moment I ate the berry crumble I had to go outside and take a fat hit of my vape and chuck some clouds,"Easily five stars for food, alcohol, service, ambiance ... except the cake was fucking dry. So definitely eat here, but get a glass of wine (or some Tony's/Archie's) for dessert instead.","Wow is all I could say, this spot is the real deal, food is amazing. Small menu but definitely on point, try everything and drink everything.  Eat, drink and drink some more","This place is absolutely unmatched to other restaurants in the greater NYC area. Incredibly friendly and responsive staff and the food is exquisite, unique, and insanely tasty! Secondly, the restaurant is conveniently located just off the Morgan stop on the L (30 second walk) and close to a lot of cool bars in the area.To top it all off, the place is not expensive at all and the dining atmosphere is top notch. Hats off to these guys.","There is a solitary neon sign marking literally the only thing open on this block. You will have to struggle with the stuck door to get in but that earns you the right to sit at the bar and watch everyone else struggle as well. This beautifully designed and friendly restaurant named after the owners dog is by far and away my favourite eatery in the entirety of bushwick. I sat at the bar with friends, having a somewhat flux number to our party they accommodated us as every turn, we began our journey with the muscles, I cannot overstate how wonderful this dish was, it has a velvety cream sauce with chunks of chorizo that is so good I would re-dip every bite before eating it.We followed that up with the house bread (three different spreads ranging from fig jam to honey butter), a lively green bean salad so fresh it brought us back from a food coma before we dove into a pork pasta so good that a gentleman at the end of the bar said it was better then his Sicilian mother's before apologizing profusely to her. I cant help it if it is true.",Otis
369,"This place just gave my roommate diarrhea and nausea. The last time we went in there they didn't even acknowledge that we were sitting there waiting to order. They were too busy with everyone else. We're done, we're never going back. The food was good though.","As a repeat customer who's been to this place more than a dozen times, my girlfriend and I were appalled by the rudeness of the resturant and chef when we returned an untouched bowl of noodle soup that reeked of bleach cleaner. They immediately said they don't smell anything, while both of us smelled it without a single doubt. I've opened a dispute on the credit card to cancel the entire transaction, and we will NEVER set foot in this place again. Shitty service, shitty attitude of the owner/chef, and sloppy cleaning practices in the kitchen. ***I will make sure this review gets posted to as many sites as possible.***","I and some other yelp users are confused as to why this place has such high reviews... the food is terrible quality! I was excited to come here because of the high reviews, and maybe we didn't order the right things, but the ramyun was basically $1 ramen bags, and they added vegetables and egg to make it fancy. There was nothing special about it at all, and I think it's unfair that we paid $7 for home ramen they dressed up in veggies and egg. The worst part is the soy garlic fried wings! Listen to me and the other yelp users that say, stay far away from these. The sauce makes the chicken soggy, the sauce seems like a watered down version of soy garlic, and the meat had RED AND DARK spots!! It wasn't a one wing thing - every wing I bit into had red, dark areas. I felt disgusting eating it. My bf and I ended up not being able to eat most of it. Save yourself the trouble and tummy aches.","Right off Queens Blvd. is this nice and cozy Korean food restaurant.  Food is delicious and authentic. Service was attentive. Staff is nice.My boyfriend left his cell phone at Doma, didn't realize it was missing until a couple of hours later. I called his number, the young waiter answered the phone and told us he'd hold on to the phone and we could go and pick it up. Everything's just right with this place. We're definitely coming back!","I usually order take out from Doma, but decided to eat in once and had to leave a review. The lady that was serving us was so kind and attentive. She always made sure everything was good. The food also came out very quick. I ordered the set 4 which is the Udong, tangsooyuk, and dukboki. I also ordered a spicy pork kimbap, my usual. The food from the set was good but similar to what you could find at any Korean place.Their complimentary soup is the best! It's spicy, refreshing, and I can literally feel my throat clearing up. Their spicy pork kimbap is also amazing, the flavor of the pork is very prominent. However, they add so much sesame oil that I can't eat it without a utensil just because the oil gets everywhere. It's still delicious though! Some of their dishes also have a lot of accessories like cabbage, mushrooms, eggplants than I expected. Their dukboki has around 10-12 rice cakes and everything else was the accessories that I didn't really want.Tl;dr - amazing complimentary soup (spicy), everything else is pretty good, similar to other korean","This is a hidden gem! I ant believe I didn't know about this place until now. The place is cozy, maybe can only fit 10-12 people. Service was great! The waiter and waitress were so nice!Get the soy garlic chicken wings! It's the perfect balance of sweet, savory, and crunchy. Much better than UFC. L.A. Galbi box: galbi was good, not burnt like at Natural Tofu Restaurant. Even the vegetables underneath the Galbi was seasoned and tasty. I ate them all, and I'm a carnivore. The salad with black pepper dressing was good too. I never tried a black pepper dressing. But it made me more veggies.Bibimbap: all the veggies were fresh. Fried meat dumplings: I was surprised it wasn't greasy at all. It was very crispy and so good.Seafood pancake: it was like a deep dish Korean pizza. Ok maybe I exaggerated but it was a huge portion and they didn't skimp on the squid. There was squid in every bite, not just batter. It also didn't feel greasy like other restaurants. How do they do that?Kimbap: can't go wrong...unless you ordered too much food and can't finish everythingDoma: It's like a Korean mom's home cooking. The food was delicious and it felt good. Will definitely come back!",Doma
370,"Regular Ramen for Ramen-connoisseurs (for Astoria, there is not much competition though).The quantity is what you expect, but if you go to Manhattan or Flushing, there is higher level Ramen around.The pork buns are better than average but again, not outstanding. Tasty as you would expect.Decoration is simple, nothing from the other world.Cash only!","I ordered two ramens for dinner and it came with a small container of broth, when I put it in a bowl it was invisible. No broth!! I called them to complain and they said that they were sorry they can't change the amount of broth. Well then it is not ramen! It's pasta dish. Very disappointed. They do deserve 4.5 stars.",Sat down and menu is given.Waitress saw me waiving at her twice. Never came to me.

There are news articles available online that discuss the owner's focus on healthier food; and the shop's tableware and furniture, which were all created by the owner and his wife. Food: Very Good (4 of 5). Dishes We've Had:- Pork Buns: Instead of pork belly, Shuya uses a thick, leaner but generous cut of meat. The result is pretty good, if a little dry.- Shuya Ramen: This dish uses a combination chicken / fish / clam broth. It's not as tasty as a creamy tonkotsu broth, but it is supposedly much healthier. Everything else in the dish came together to create a very good experience -- the wavy noodles had a perfect chew; the two slices of pork char siu were generously thick as in the pork buns. The two clams and ramen egg were pretty good, too.Service: Good (3 of 5). Complimentary water, invisibly refilled.Atmosphere: Good (3 of 5). One well-maintained unisex bathroom.At the time of our visit, there was a Japanese media crew filming the restaurant and conducting an interview with the owner. This intrigued us -- what else is of note here? We'll be back to find out....","This was one of the few unique ramen joints I wanted to try out for quite some time now. Has some interesting ramen choices.I ordered two of their small bowls.The first bowl I ordered was the Assari Yuzu Shio Ramen. It has cherry stone clams, yuzu, and mizuna. This bowl was good until I realized the greens, mizuna, stewed a bit in the broth which made it slightly bitter...I couldn't enjoy the broth....I would of definitely recommend some other choices of veggies for this bowl.The second bowl I ordered was their Shuya Ramen. It's a chicken, fish and clam based broth; first time trying it and it was pretty good...pretty light. The chashu was very tender and yummy. And the egg....I LOVE super soft boiled eggs with a nice soupy center and this place delivered it like a champ.All in all, I enjoyed my visit here. I'll consider giving it another try as the seafood ramen I had was...mediocre in my personal opinion. The Shoya Ramen is something I'll definitely order again but I'll get the large next time.I'll suggest everyone to try their unique ramen and maybe you guys will enjoy it more than me.",Shuya Cafe de Ramen
371,Basic but delicious food . Nice people. An absolutely unacceptable wait for either dine in or take out.  This organization is a structureless mess that neither respects their customer's time or has any plan /inclination to make their business run more efficiently. I don't mind waiting 2 hours for well prepared food...but don't say it's going to take 30-40 minutes when you know it's not true because that's dishonest . My family spends hundreds of dollars per month here ...or at least used to. So done !,"I'm sure there are thousands of Italian restaurants to go to in New York, but I choose this place. I come here solely for one thing only...their peppers!!! They are to die for! I don't know how they make it, but you can taste the freshness and the amazing flavors! You must try this place.",Let me start by saying i ordered because i have been to this establishment before and was always satisfied today i ordered spaghetti  and meatballs for my kids and a salad with avocado and heart of palm for me... what i received was lettuce and a half of tomato .... I WAS ROBBED WITH OUT A GUN .... $10.28 for lettuce and a half of tomato upsets me..... i did use door dash and I'm asking for a refund this is not the same Joe's it used to be very disappointing......i can't say again how disappointed i am over a silly salad but i want what i asked and payed for not what you decided you wanted to give me,"A very quaint and intimate setting for all occasions. The host as well as each member of the staff that I encountered were so hospitable. I definitely see why the regulars return for the sense of family provided along with wonderfully prepared dishes. The portions are of large size so you will definitely be taking home a doggy bag. In addition to the portion size the food is just banging with flavor. There is no question that the food is authentic. The decor are tables covered in white linens and green foliage. The lightening is relaxing and not too bright. The music is soothing and the atmosphere just overflows with love for good tasting food. There are 2 single stall bathrooms and a few chairs lined up near the hostess stand for those waiting for a table. We arrived after 8pm on a Thursday and only had to wait for a table because we requested a section in the back but if we wanted to sit front and center we would have been seated immediately. As we waited for a table, I enjoyed watching the staff interact with several patrons as they finished up their meal. You could easily tell that the tables had regulars but then again this was my first time and I was treated like family so I could be wrong. I ordered the chicken parm with spaghetti. I was expecting it to come all on one plate but I was wrong. There was a plate with chicken and a second plate with pasta. I had loads of food and it tasted sooo good. My friend ordered some pasta and added chicken. I forgot which dish she ordered exactly but she also was a fan. I am glad she was referred to this place by another friend. Upon completion of the meal, the waitress took my plates and boxed up the leftovers. The complimentary bread with oil was also a delight and so flavorful. The bread was piping hot and interior was hot. I can only speak good about this restaurant. Dining here was such a delight and made a great start to visiting my Brooklyn friends. I look forward to visiting here again when I return in the future.",The owner of this restaurant is extremely nice and welcoming. We were seated quickly and our waitress was very attentive. She brought us water and bread (which was delicious) and menus. I got the eggplant parm and it was delicious. Huge portion sizes and great prices. The calamari was great also. I will definitely be back!,Best Italian food in all of Ridgewood. Great and friendly service they are always willing to accommodate your requests. A must to go to when you are in the neighborhood.,Joe's Restaurant
372,"We walk-in and no servers to greet us and take us to our seats. Do we just seat ourselves? What's going on here??!! We walked in halfway and that's when the bartender noticed us and we asked if we can sit outside. The outside area is cute. That's all I can say about that since that was all they had going for them. We didn't order any drinks, but we did order food. I really didn't like the food that I got as an entree. The potato skins were ordered as an appetizer and that was good. It came with sour cream and sprinkled with bacon bits. For my entree I ordered linguine with chicken marsala. The chicken was tasteless plus the linguine. I had to douse it with hot sauce to give it some flavor. Never ordering that again at a bar.The service was how do you say it... VERY HORRIBLE! It was so s-l-o-w! I was like at this rate I could've done everything myself. We were hardly checked up on. Getting water was hard in itself. I don't know whose to blame either the management, staff or the cooks. I guess everyone gets equal blame. I just learned that I'll never be coming back to this establishment!","My server Andress was extremely rude. I sat down and wanted soup but he said I couldn't try it. I told him I had bad soup there before and he responded by saying that's ok and refused to be accommodating. My mom asked to try the soup as well and the server said she couldn't.Andress also never came over to ask how our food was. I ordered the beet and goat cheese salad. My mom and sister got a burger and my mom's burger was super grisly. We would've let Andress know about our food if he came over. We wanted to order drinks too but he never came back for our drink order. I would come back for the salad, or for take out. But the service isn't great.","Called in to do an order for pickup and was told they were too busy and was hung up on. Never in my life have I experienced a business do that. Ate there once and had pretty bad service, but was giving it another shot. Not again.","Although we eat here occasionally during the year, I had to comment on the delicious meal we had today. It is Easter Sunday and our reservation was for 1pm. We arrived at 12:30, knew we were early, however we were greeted by the owner and staff and escorted to our table. This is a prefixed menu for the day. Our meal  was delicious! We had the Turkey/Virginia Ham plate (something new for me) served with mashed potatoes, carrots and parsnips, Irish sausage and walnut stuffing, cranberry sauce and gravy. We really enjoy their holiday menu. The staff is always friendly and so very attentive. Not really a desert person but our waitress recommended the warm strawberry and  Ruhbarb pie.... delightful. (so was the ice cream)","Good food and beer selections. The wait staff is pleasant and attentive. Nice local crowd. The owner greeted us and even came by our table to check on everything. The food is excellent here, made fresh from scratch and all six of us were pleased with our meals. Cozy table settings and atmosphere.... I think I found a new favorite!!","Decided to head to the area for a low-key Friday night dinner. Stopped by this particular restaurant as it had seating available and an inviting atmosphere.Secured booth-seating for two inside (outdoor area was closed) and was immediately greeted by a server for drink orders. Started off with a Smithwicks ($7ish) and shared the Curry Cheese Fries ($9). The large helping of fries are fresh and crisp, sandwiched by a layer of melted cheese up top and curry at the bottom. Solid taste from the gravy and the cheese was not overbearing. For my main course, had the Kettle Burger ($17) - a beef patty topped with bacon, cheddar cheese, onions, peppers, lettuce and tomato (with fries and a pickle to the side). Basic overall burger, cooked medium with a crisp layer of bacon for texture. Filling meal overall that we had to pack most up to go.Though the food here is simple, the service and ambiance brings this pub over the top. We got to-go containers for our food without asking, complimentary soup, and the music was never too loud. Perfect spot for a simple date/night out.",Copper Kettle Bar & Restaurant
373,Nothing special just a thin dough and all you can taste is the strawberries and banana together. Does not have any unique taste.,"Their crepes here are decent and very instagram worthy, however, I think that's about it. Their crepes are extra crunchy - which some may like. I personally like my crepes soft so the Nutella melts on it perfectly. The idea of having the crepe wrapped and imitate a rose is cool, but it's hard to eat. In order for it to stay, I guess the crepe itself can't be soft or else it would just flop and not stay in place. Not my favorite crepe spot. I would come here just for pictures... at most.","Not a fan of this spot. Their crepes aren't the best I've had. The line is crazy long, order times are insane. Staff is just as disorientated as we are. I like the putting the crepe in a cone thing though. That was clever.",Never though I'd like crepes but I love it. This place makes them great. Refreshing!  Easy to eat!  Gluten free!  One of my favorite deserts.  I tried the sweet versions not so sure about the savory ones,"I love this place. So yummy. I went twice. The 1st time I got the Caramel Fuji apple crepe. It was amazing. So I came back with my brother and his family. We ordered the BLT crepe, the short rib crepe, shrimp & avocado crepe, the mango and raspberry crepe and the assorted fruit crepe.  They were all delicious. My favorite is still the caramel apple crepe. I can't wait to go back and try some more.","The mango deluxe took a bit of time to prepare, given its various components.  The mascarpone cream was delicious and the fresh mango as well.  The dried mango was on the chewier side.  The amount of fruit was modest, as deeper along the container, it was flaky pancake and little else.  The overall taste was good but some elements left more to be desired.",T-Swirl Crêpe
374,"Their beef quesadilla is awful!  It weighed hardly anything in the bag and when I opened it there was mostly lettuce inside these tiny tortillas!   Not to mention the beef barely weighed 4oz, I would say closer to 2oz and it was flavorless!   Seemed like frozen beef strips to me. (4oz of beef is one serving size)What a waste of money","Unfortunately, this Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde burrito made with chicken, pintos and rice, looked beautiful--but had the mouth feel of a dry sponge. With a beautiful garnish of pico de gallo, this large meal in a tortilla (it's not a wrap!)--looked hearty and yummy--but it fell short (once again) because there is no sauce. No salsa--no salsa verde, or red salsa, leaving it just dry. This is comparable to a PB&J, without the J; or Thanksgiving turkey meal, but with no gravy; or a hamburger with no ketchup!In all seriousness, I am not sure why this place, and others in the area, do not supply / provide some appropriate salsa for meals like this. What they DID put in the bag, is a tiny cup with some heavily watered-down guacamole-flavored seafoam green colored sauce, and a tiny cup with some Earth-scorching red hot sauce--these are not salsa. I ordered this six months back, and It was the same. I had ordered it today thinking it would be better, but no.Now, they lost a customer. I often wonder if there is a person who cares, and oversees what they sell / cook.",I ordered a large chicken quesadilla for pick up yesterday. Total was 10.89 and server confirmed before charging my card. He decides to charge me 77.85 and gives me the receipt to sign. I look at the receipt and I said did you charge me 77.85 for my quesadilla??? He mumbles I'm sorry and refunds me. Then charges me again for the quesadilla. I spent about 89 dollars that day. I have to wait until I get my refund back. So what if I didn't have that money? Did he even check before charging me and giving me the receipt. At that point I shouldn't paid anything. I honestly think he did it on purpose and thought I wouldn't notice the difference. It's a shame because the place is close by. Worst customer service. And mind you my food was soggy and wet after all that. Server name is Luis.,"Good food with great, very attentive staff.Took my vegetarian daughter & her vegan boyfriend here for dinner.   We loved it.  It's not easy finding a place for all of us to enjoy.They had the seitan burritos, I had the el pastor tacos.   Would have liked a little more pineapple in with my tacos, next time I will ask.The food was delicious, the staff are wonderful & everyone walked out happy.I look forward to going back soon!",Great food feels like your eating at home. you wouldn't tell from the outside but this place had some serious good Mexican food it not a huge location which gives it that homey feeling the was delicious from the tamales to the tacos al pastor their fresh fish of the day everything was cooked with those authentic favor of mexico you expect to get when you go out they make a great tasting red sangria that can quickly catch up to you,De Mole is such a woodside gem. The service inside and with delivery is always friendly and quick. I've enjoyed everything I've eaten but I tend to always get the De Mole salad and shrimp fajitas because it's so amazing.  They also have a perfect small brunch menu that is amazing with great coffee.,De Mole
375,"Wifi doesn't work and no help from the staff. Plugs in the wall don't work and $3 brownie tasted absolutely awful, couldn't even finish it","Absolutely terrible 1st time customer experience. This review is based on customer service. This place has issues hiding within these walls. Just moved into the neighborhood recently and wanted to find a coffee shop I could relax at and get work done. I walked into this establishment and was happily greeted by two ladies. I asked if they had juice and wifi? The gentleman responded yes and YES WIFI. Before I go any further it's important to 1) have wifi in a cafe and 2) if you have a wifi sign posted, that would give me the impression wifi is available and finally 3) trust the employee when they say wifi is available .....you would think right?I took a seat and asked multiple times for the password. The guy said told me what he thought was the password. It wasn't. He made a call to find out the issue (Calling his boss) but got distracted with only one customer that came in with two other employee standing around. The password doesn't work. He told me to try another wifi login from another store (AT&T Time Warner Provider) that didn't work either because I'm not a Time Warner Customer.Disappointed, I decided to pack all my stuff and began to walk towards the exit once the guy finished up with his customer. Very nicely I said, ""Listen man your place seems like a nice small place to come to and your employee's were nice greeting me at the door but I'm a little disappointed that your wifi doesn't work when you told me it did. I bought the JUICE ONLY after you told me you had wifi."" He made one last effort and called his boss to figure out what was going on with the server/login. They talk back and forth agreeing that THE GUY told me the wifi was down trying to cover up that fact that he told me the wifi was down! The guys tells me it's been down for a couple days since other technicians were arranging things in the establishment. I started to get even more upset (but not screaming or yelling) ""Dude really. You lied to me. Before I bought the juice you told me you had wifi, so I bought the drink. I was planning on working here for some time and without wifi I've been wasting my time here and my money. This has been terrible experience. He apologizes and tries to give me a protein bar. I'm about to walk out the door when he asks whether or not I paid for my juice! Then I said surprisingly, ""Your kidding right. After all that your going to STILL attempt to charger me for this juice! You just lied to me. Did you not??"" (He unhappily agrees) ""Then why would you think it's fair to charger me for something when you told me before I bought the juice you had wifi? I never would have purchased the juice if I knew you didn't have wifi."" No real response only ""I have kids, my job is the bring money to my boss"" he says. I tell him ""that doesn't apply in this situation. You need to take responsibly for making a mistake and own up!"" I'm about to walk out fed up with everything, then threatens that he'll call the police if I don't pay. It took an incredible amount of patience, pride and inner whoop ass not to just walk out. I wasn't taking this matter any longer so I paid and told the guy I would never be coming back, he's yelp would be getting a terrible review. *****Ask if they're wifi works before expecting to bust out your laptop for a couple hours. Make sure the login username- password works first before you sit down or order a drink/food. They just might lie to you to bring in customers.","Had my dad staying with us and wanted to grab some breakfast and tea with him. Heard great things about Blue Cups, so come Noon we decided to venture out in the cold and walk there. They were closed. No reason. No signs. Yelp, Google, Online says OPEN, door said 7am-9pm Saturday...obviously not.","Experience 1. Blk Coffee (El Dorado Sumatra Mandheling)- fresh cup, smooth, good all around flavor.2. Mexican Brownie - one of the few sweet brownies that I can enjoy eating.Service- friendly, warmRecommendations - not today","2 visits, Order History1. Sampled house coffee2. Americano au lait w. Almond milk3. Mex Choc & vegan Brownie4. Chai LatteAssessment1. Good flavor, fresh2. Pleasant taste, smooth3. Both were very tasty. Mex choc brownie was reminiscent of flavors from south American hot chocolate.4. Tasted processed and too sweet for my taste buds.Service: My first visit was great. The woman who attended me was very accommodating and brewed me a fresh cup of coffee to sample. Her hospitality was genuine and warm.","Up until Saturday morning, I would have given this a 5 star review. The owner was so nice and we absolutely loved this place. We found this place while staying in the area and made it our morning start all week long. But we came in this morning, and the girl working didn't show up until 8:12 am (place opens at 8 am). She then had to open the place up. We came in and sat down. She finished a few things and then took our order. She then proceeded to wait on almost a dozen customers before we received our order, even though they came and went long after we ordered. Our kids ordered iced lattes, my wife an Americano and mine was a cappuccino. All are easy and fast drinks to prepare. As I type this, we are still waiting on our bagels as she continues to serve customers who keep walking in the door.",Blue Cups
376,"Ordered online and estimated time was 20 mins. No problem, very reasonable. Got to the restaurant 30 mins later and my order was not even started. Took them another 20-25 mins to make the food. We ordered the lechon which was extremely dry. The garlic rice was burnt. The bistek was also extremely salty.","This used to be my go to for filipino food. For the past two years me and my boyfriend have been coming here every time we crave for filipino food. The food and service has always been exceptional and fresh. However, as our most recent visit we believe that they might have changed the chef. The food became spicier than usual, up to the point were I was unable to eat it and the crispy pata was full of whole peppercorns in each bite.",I couldn't hold my bowels the next day!!! Should have known by the disgusting taste of their food. Stay AWAY,"There's quite a few Filipino restaurants in Woodside and this is one of the better ones. I've had several dishes here that are really good especially the crispy pata, nilagang baka (they make the best out of all the Filipino restaurants in Woodside) and Kare kare. The place is also very clean and service is friendly and attentive.","I've made it a casual weekend mission to visit all the Filipino restaurants in the Woodside/Sunnyside area and, not to spoil this entire review, Kabayan on Queens Blvd is the best one yet.I've given this place, and many others, a fair shot--visiting at least three or four times over the past year or two, to really take every aspect of the restaurant into account. My first venture into Kabayan was a Boodle fight meal with my boyfriend and one of our other friends. We were surprised that the spread was ready right as we walked in; just a testament to the good service here. I had initially only visited its neighbor Tito Rad's because for some reason, it always looked way more pack. I don't think that's the case anymore nowadays, though.We were greeted and seated immediately. Kabayan sticks out to me particularly because, unlike virtually all the Filipino restaurants in the area, the service here is actually great. The water is poured as you're seated (I'm looking at you, Renee's in Woodside), the servers are super attentive, and it doesn't take a million years to get the check. Filipinos by default are very hospitable and very polite but the water pouring and occasional hovering throughout is an American thing and we'd all love for it to apply here, too. It's good for business.Now for the food! I'd be biased as to say that every single Filipino restaurant in this area is fantastic but I really do mean it. Cooking these dishes has almost been embedded into each family that, although we do have regional variations, you can never really go wrong. Here at Kabayan, though.. wow. Everything is just so perfectly seasoned. The beef Nilaga is fantastic, among many others. I would've loved if they served breakfast (silog's) all day but there is an easy workaround where you can just order Sinangag, the meats, and eggs separately. It'll just run you a few extra bucks. Their sizzling sisig and Bangus (milkfish) is soooo good. I've brought so many friends of different cultures here and these seem to be a favorite. One of my personal favorites is the Pancit Canton.. shrimp allergy and all, hah.If you're ever in the area or if you're on a quest for really good Filipino food, this place is well worth a visit!","Came here on a Wednesday afternoon with a group of 5 and it wasn't too busy. For 5 people, we ordered 7 dishes and 2 halo halos and it was the perfect amount! Dishes are on the smaller side for family style, but they were all priced under $15, so it was the perfect excuse to try more dishes. I've had Filipino food in the city before, as well as homemade, and Kabayan comes closest to homemade! We ordered the lumpia, kare kare, bistek, lechon, pancit, garlic rice and ssisig. Would definitely come back for my Filipino fix!",Kabayan
377,Food was decent  (4/5)Got the bibimbap The rice cake was a bit sweet Service was quick Their miso soup was chill so,My friend from Queens brought me here. Kimganae is a destination for locals in the area. He told he came here often with his friends. He set the expectations high for me. I was disappointed by the small portions of rice. It was disproportionate to the size of the pork katsu I got. The katsu itself tasted bland. The meat was dry and overcooked.,"I took out this spicy pork over rice, and it was horrible as you all can see. It was too burnt to eat and it tasted weird, think it went bad. And there were only some pieces of pork, but the rest was onions. I would never order any food from here.","Very nice setting, but also very busy.Came here for the spicy ricecakes with noodles and spicy pork, squid, and rice. Delicious!","Food is solid and for the price point it will satisfy the Korean cravings that you have once in a while.I didn't have a chance to take a picture of everything, but among the three of us we ordered a omurice, cheese donkatsu, and a jjolmyun ddeokbokki.The food is very simple and clean. For the three of us ordering three things was more than enough, but had we ordered two dishes I think we would've been left wanting a little more, so it depends on how hungry you are.","I haven't been to Kimgaenae in 4-5 years (since high school!), but besides the interior, this places has not changed at all! The food is still delicious and cheap, and the restaurant is still super small and cramp. It amazes me to think the taste hasn't changed since I was a little girl! Order: - Kimganae Pork Cutlet (5/5) ~ Comes with a scoop of rice, corn, and a salad- Bibimbap (4/5) ~ Comes with rice, bean sprouts, carrot, radish, mushroom, cucumber, and an egg with a gochugang on the sidePros:- A lot of Korean style ""street food"" to choose from - Tasty - Cheap ~ They also have a lunch special- Very good portion size ~ especially for what you're paying for- Quick and friendly servers ~ Food comes out pretty quickly too- Complimentary soup and kkakdugi (radish kimchi)- Conveniently located close to the 7-train- Renovated interior ~ Restaurant has a much more clean and modern look Cons:- Very small restaurant ~ While they renovated the interior, I feel like the restaurant actually got smaller. They do have more seats in the basement, but I would not recommend coming with a large group - Good luck finding parking in this area if you didn't come by subway or busOverall:- I highly recommend coming to Kimganae if your looking for a cheap and filling meal. It's also a great restaurant to get introduced to Korean food!",Kimganae
378,"Thai iced tea - couldn't tell it was vegan at all! Very good.Scallion pancakes - pretty inventive with the mango salsa, but I miss the traditional sauce that usually comes with it.Spinach Jap chae (Korean glass noodles) - oddly, the spinach tasted like basil, which was fine with me, because I like basil. The veggie fish-cake was a little weird, but I feel most fake meat are, that's why I usually stay away from those. Just wanted to try it to see what they meant by veggie fish-cake. I have to remember to ask for no mushrooms next time, but otherwise a decent dish.","The food was good!! I tried the tofu skin wrap (very crispy and the sauce was awesome), soy curry (huge portion and spice enough but the coconut rice was no flavor) and the seitan bbq (omg what a texture!! Loved, but the peas was no salt no flavor too)BUUUUUUT the waiter follow us asking for more tip!!!! LIKE WHHHAAAT?!!?!? Very embarrassing and annoying. Me= never more jujube tree","I want to love Jujube Tree. I really, really do. The first time I came here I had the tofu teriyaki and it was really good! But all my other experiences have just been upsetting. I ordered the eggplant and green bean lunch special last year and while it was good, I had an awful bout of food poisoning (the works) right afterwards. I've ordered twice again from Jujube Tree after the food poisoning (I wanted to give them another chance) and though I was never sick again, the food is just SO MEH and is lacking in flavor. I ordered the BiBimBap only to be met with an assortment of flavorless veggies that did not compliment each other well. Another try was the BBQ Satay lunch special which was also completely lacking in flavor (How can have a BBQ dish that has NO BBQ flavor?) I had to douse both of these dishes in Sriracha to make them bearable so I wasn't just throwing money away.However, I will say that I do like their pumpkin soup and spring rolls and that is what is keeping this review at 2 stars vs 1 star. TLDR; their food is really hit or miss. Nothing is consistent. I love trying different things and I think it's REALLY cool that they offer vegan dishes in Astoria, but good grief a little flavor would go a long way.","Amazing vegan option. My friend is vegan and it's always tough to find a good vegan-friendly spot to dine. Luckily this place does the charm. The menu was expansive and even though me being a meat lover, I wasn't disappointed at all. We got a couple of dish that we shared and loved everything. The desert was a bit huge and heavy but delish. Overall you can't go wrong with this joint if you are a vegan or non vegan.","Great vegan restaurant. We got a seat next to the open doors which was really nice. To start we ordered the pancake and summer rolls, and I got the Thai iced tea. I really enjoyed both of these appetizers. The spring rolls are so healthy with jicama, carrots, and tofu in the center, and the sauce is delicious. The pancake is topped with mango salsa. I am not a fan of seitan, and fake meats can be really hit or miss so we stayed away from those kinds of options. Instead we choose the spicy mushrooms and pad Thai for the main course. I love that the mushrooms come with kale and rice to offset the sweet sauce. The pad Thai was absolutely perfect. Really great choice for both vegans and meat-eaters, as well as those trying to eat a little more veggies when they go out!",Jujube Tree is a delicious vegetarian pan-East Asian restaurant.  I've only tried delivery but it was so much better than I expected.  I will definitely be a regular customer. I had a glass noodle dish for a main and also a seaweed salad that had tofu and beans in it.  Both were very tasty.  My only complaint is that delivery took a long time.  My food arrived half an hour or more later than predicted.,Jujube Tree
379,"I would give 2 stars but I'm deciding to be nice about it ... My second time at Numero 28. The first time I wasn't really impressed, but this second time really made me decide to never come back. Waited quiet some time for our food to be served and it was not even busy ... 3 people inside & the outside was a little over 5 tables taken. After waiting for some time we got our food and the inside of my lasagna was COLD. I had my boyfriend taste it to make sure I'm not crazy and he confirmed it was cold. It seemed as though this food was just prepackaged and they microwaved it and only the outside got hot while the inside was COLDDDDDD. He told me we could send it back and have them warm it up but I wasn't trying to wait over 25 minutes for that to happen I just wanted to finish and get out. It was not even good because it was cold. Horrible time. No thank you not again.","Absolutely avoid! Besides the fact that this location is highly overpriced for the area is an understatement, however, what was more concerning was the managements blatant disregard for their customers safety. First, they allowed a guest at the bar to vape while waiting for their drink. To be clear, electronic cigarettes (vaping) is banned anywhere cigarettes are prohibited yet they let this guest do it and made no attempt to stop the behavior. Second, they allowed an unleashed dog inside the dining room, where the dog was free to roam around and was running up and down the restaurant. When my peripheral vision caught side out the dog, I could have bet my arms and legs it was a huge rat - nope, it was a dog. Don't get me wrong, I love animals but wtf is this dog doing inside a restaurant, running around as if it's his backyard!? Again, no mention to the patron who not surprisingly also happens to be the same person who was vaping at the bar not long before. I have since reported both incidents to the Health Dept.....If you're in the mood to spend your hard earned dollars on an overpriced joint that doesn't seem to give one dam about their own hygiene and their customers safety, head to this joint. Otherwise, avoid!",This spot opened recently in my neighborhood so I decided to check it out. I came solo for an early dinner on a Saturday night. There was no wait to be seated. The lights are low and there are candles on the tables making it a perfect date spot. The waiters were attentive and quick. I ordered a glass of red and the Numero 28 individual pizza. When it arrived I was afraid it was too large for me to finish but after a couple of bites I knew I would finish the whole thing with no problems. It was delicious and I can't wait to go back and try something new.,"I was on a mission. We are nearing the end of the summer and I needed to satisfy a craving... I needed to have pizza, at least a slice. I searched and found my target Numero 28.Numero 28 really has that Williamsburg vibe going, with the house music playing and BK atmospheric tone. For appetizer we had the fried calamari, which was nice and fresh. I did appreciate that if you order a large pie you can split it into two flavors. The split consisted of the Tartufo and the Bianca del Diavolo flavors. Distinctly different, but great tasting. The service was great, and the drinks were spot on. I also appreciated that they have daily specials.When I have food cravings I must satisfying them, I'm glad I came to the right place. I will have to come back to decide if the pizza was THAT good or I was on a binge... we'll see.","Really cute spot! We loved the eggplant parmigiana appetizer along with the arancini balls (YUM!)We ordered the Numero 28 pizza with speck & italian sausage on one side and vegetarian on the other side.  It was definitely delicious!  Thin crust and packed with flavor.Service was top notch and staff is very friendly.  Came for dinner so a little pricier, but the lunch menu looks like a great deal for every day.I would definitely want to come back here.","I'm honestly really shocked by the 4 stars.  To keep it real, I can see why it is Numero 28, because it certainly isn't Numero 1.  Never mind the fact they have you thinking you're paying one price, then when you go to pick it up, surprise your bill is higher because they didn't update their prices on their website for ordering.  Oops.  But I digress, let's get to what the yelpers wanna know... the food.  We ordered the food for our Friday takeout dinner.  I didn't pick it up, my husband did so I cannot comment on the ambiance or anything like that but I can discuss our meals.  We ordered French fries, arancini, trofie al pesto, fettuccine ragu, rigatoni della nonna Eugenia.  Ok so here it is, fries were pretty standard typical restaurant fries.  Honestly the best thing was the arancini.  To me it had the most flavor/tasted best.  The fettuccine and the rigatoni were so dry and bland.  The meatballs weren't very good either.  They looked sort of odd and not quite like what I saw in the pictures.  So a bit misleading and yes they were tiny balls.  The pesto I didn't try because I don't like pesto but my husband wasn't very pleased with it.  We basically dumped our food because it was bland, flavorless, dry... all around not what we would expect from an Italian place.  So many other better restaurants that would notify you of significant price differences from their own website to the actual amount you pay.",Numero 28 Pizzeria
380,"Our second visit here was fine with a little financial mishap due to check mix-up.Our second visit here end in food poisoning.Four diners order fried squid and takoyaki.Diner #1: Miso paitan, pork. All is well.Diner #2: Spicy miso paitan, pork. Slight stomach ache.Diner #3: Mega paitan, pork. Stomach ache and nausea.Diner #4: Original paitan, pork. Stomach ache and vomiting.Common denominator? I'm thinking the broth, as everything else was the same. Sorry, but not coming back.",Please avoid this place. The ramen here was soooo bad. I came here for Saturday dinner around 6pm and it was empty. I got the Paitan ramen without onions but it still came with tons of onion and a tiny piece of pork....The noodles were decent but the broth was terrible. It was very salty and missing that umami flavor I look for in ramen. It wasn't creamy or fattened with pork but rather glutinous as if they used flour or corn starch to thicken the soup. So gross. I felt like it was such a waste of money. You can get better ramen at Ajisen.,"Grabbed dinner here on a Sunday night and didn't realize it was cash only.  Got here early enough so that we were able to seat the four of us.  Never ate at the Manhattan restaurant, but enjoyed the ramen and fried chicken.  Because it's an open kitchen, it was a little uncomfortable, but the food comes out fast enough so we didn't need to stay long.  Not sure what material is on the floor, but it was slippery.  Seems like an odd thing to note, unless you","My go-to ramen place in Queens, including Forest Hills, but excluding Astoria. For times when it's hard to justify travelling way too far for a bowl of ramen. Mega Paitan is what I usually get, and it's just enough to fill me up. The broth is rich, ultra-collagenous(just short of Mu Ramen's Oxtail and Bone Marrow Ramen), and just a tad milky. The noodles are firm, but they can change that at your request.Surprisingly, the chicken char-siu is the more consistent meat topping, while the pork can be hit or miss in terms of cook, as well as flavour. The pork isn't as good here as Manhattan locations. I've never had a problem with the spring onions as much I did with the garlic paste. I found that the garlic paste is incredibly salty and overpowering, which detracts from the broth and makes it unfinishable. This is a problem for me no matter which Totto I go to. If you're like me, you might ask for a separate bowl to put the paste and add it in as desired. I enjoy the garlic flavour, but the sodium content is obnoxious. The last time I went (7/7/19) was an outlier in that the broth was almost clear, unlike the creamy and rich broth that I was used to. It may have been because I was there for lunch, so you may need to account for that factor when eating ramen there.","Second time I've been here. Ordered the spicy mega paitan. Still disappointed. It's definitely not a bad bowl of ramen but it's not nearly enough to justify its price of $18 even with the ""extra"" toppings. Everything was average. Despite the relatively large bowl, there was an overload of cabbage and what felt like only three bites of noodles. Half of my time eating the bowl was picking up pieces of cabbage. Normally this amount of time spent eating cabbage would over saturate the noodles with broth, but luckily there weren't that many noodles to speak of. This isn't a bad thing. I know plenty of people who love cabbage and prefer to avoid carbs. It also wasn't spicy but the server brought extra sauce to increase the heat. Service was great, and the server was friendly. The chicken char siu was abysmal, and I'm not convinced it's actually chicken. Hard avoid paying $2 for it. It was soft like a wet turkey slice but difficult to chew and break down, like tendon, except it's somehow called chicken. It's not a bad place, but relative to the other strong options nearby, I wouldn't come here. Despite the restaurant being decent...the price, the opportunity cost, and high expectations you get from seeing the other Tottos in Manhattan make this a pass for me.","It has taken a while, but Flushing finally has a legit ramen joint. To think that I no longer have to leave Flushing to get some decent Japanese ramen.I got there late, close to closing, but there was still a line. A signup board was left on the stool in the front for you to put your name down. The wait was probably 30 minutes around 8:30pm on a Thursday night.- The inside is very cramped and is not really recommended for large groups.- Solo eaters have a bar seating.- There's coat hangers on the wall for people sitting on stools.- The menu is very simple. Most ramen has their signature straight ramen. The Miso and Mega Paitan has their wavy ramen.- Music is American hip-hop and rap.- Restroom is a single-stall restroom.- Gyoza tasted like store-bought.Overall, the broth and noodles were very rich and flavorful. This will be my go-to ramen shop from now on.",Totto Ramen - Flushing
381,"One star is because the service is terrible. It's unfortunate because they have delicious food and a great atmosphere. Every time I go there, the service is almost non-existent and we feel like we're forgotten about. I had to get up and beg multiple times to get and pay my check!I stay away from here now because of the terrible service. I tried going again yesterday, and noticed that nobody came to take my order despite multiples servers there so I just decided to leave instead of dealing with the terrible lack of service again.","We ordered brunch here on a weekend. We ordered the sausage one and the coulette steak option for brunch. They got the order wrong for both of us. We ordered our eggs over medium they got it over easy the first time and the second time over hard. The sausage was way too salty and the steak was hard and dry. The portions are small. The only good thing was their fresh orange juice! In summary, this place is so NOT worth your money.",The food was okay. I had a bean stew with pork and some awful tasting sausage. Im big on sausage and if I didn't like it it's not a good thing. Food was horrible but it wasn't great either. Drinks were decent as well. Moeny spent was up there because of drinks.,"Great food, great service, great entertainment. Some friends and I visited Beija Flor last Sunday since we were in the neighborhood. I think that we pretty much all agreed that the place was top notch. I did not not hear any complaints about the food or the service. Most of the entrees are large enought to split between two people. Plus on Sundays, the restaurant has live music and dancing.","We were looking for a place close enough to home this place came up during the search so we decided to give it a try. we had rsvp but didn't seem like we needed it this was an early day after work & the place was not crowded. Once seated glad it was still happy hour, we decided to go with the Caipirinha very good, nice taste & good amount of alcohol. they start u off with some hot toasted bread & butter hard to resist hot bread, it was good. Appetizers we had the Salgadinhos, tried the Coxinnha chicken very good, pastel de carme & queso, carne pastel was better .. the cheese one was ok & missing a lot of the cheese, all good just a lot of fried stuff not the healthiest of options. Main dish I had the Grilled Steak w mash Yuca & collard greens, good steak , very good yuca , the collards were ok for me. my company had the Chicken , with corn & veggies ..very good chicken  great tasting corn. Decent size location, nice decor with the flower ceiling, service I must agree w past reviews they seem to forget u are there, drinks took forever to get to us seems like we had to keep reminding them. when it came time for the check that took time as well. service can improved, good food & decent prices.","Here they don't have parking so street parking it is. but depending on when you get here it is not super hard to get parkingThey have live music on certain days so make sure to check it out cause if you love it yay if not nay cause there is a cover charge associated with the live music. Also pay attention if you come in and the band starts well after you been there cause they may sneak the cover charge on you too.Here they have Brazilian food and it is all a la cart, so don't expect a buffet not a by the weight. The atmosphere is nice, the decor is warm and sophisticated. The staff is friendly and very accommodating to larger and small parties, however keep in mind that they do have live music here on certain days and then it can be very difficult to find a table. But they are amazing to try and accommodate, they will try to give you a table for a quick dinner whenever possible even if they are all booked. We came over for a late dinner. We were a larger group but at the time we came it was near closing time so it worked our just fine. They were amazingBatida de coco- amazing, a must try when coming here, nice and sweet. Loads of coconut flavor and little coconut pieces. this is my go to cocktail here. Guarana- this is a very popular soda in brazil, I love it and if you never had you should!Pasteis de queijo-  I was not impressed with them, the cheese was almost non existant I was expecting a lot more cheese, this appetizer is not a great idea. It comes with a ketchup and mayo sauce and still did not save it. They should add more cheese and have the pastry a little drier cause it was a bit too fattyManjar de coco- that takes the prize, amazing!! Not heavy and very yummy with lots of coconut pieces, loved it. Brigadeiro- this mousse was a little heavier so unless u are a crazy chocolate lover this is not for you, this dessert is very strong and thick. Pao de queijo- as expected, fresh and warm from the oven very nice, these are worth to have for sure.So I been here plenty of times and some of them the food was amazing and others not so much, I think I don't have a pic but the feijoada is awesome, you might have to order your protein separately but none the less it is a very worth it dish. Here is a hit or miss with the food in my opinion, so good luck, but the service at least to me has been great consistently.Come by and take a chance you might be glad you did.",Beija Flor
382,The food was amazing.My girlfriend is a vegetarian (trying to go vegan) and I am not.We decided to do takeout and try it.I was shocked at the fact that it wasn't meat.Everything is so flavorful and just downright delicious.Can't wait to go back!,Okay so I made the conversion for health reasons and have been struggling to find a place that had the ability to provide the nutritional aspect without sacrificing the taste. VCII has one me and my wife as regulars and there's absolutely not one complaint.,Although there are many vegan restaurants opening up this is the real GOAT. Forever will be my go to but I don't come often because of the location. Busy area and limited parking. But food is A1.,"Trudging through the summer heat in Queens in search of the Veggie Castle. We hopped in line shortly before it extended out the door. This place is popular and it is assembly line style so you can see exactly what you to eat. The chicken drumsticks stole the show. They also have these meat alternatives that are almost indistinguishable. Especially the ginger noodles with 'meat'. And the Mac n cheese tasted boxed but still yummy and appreciative. Seating isn't ideal. This is mostly a grab n go type of place or a grab, sit, eat wicked fast, then leave type of place. Prices are reasonable for the large portions which are more than filling. Definitely one of the better places I've visited in NYC. Cheers.","This place doesn't even make sense. Vegan drumsticks that you would swear are chicken...like they have skin...its bonkers. The ""sister"" restaurant to Sybil's Bakery next door. While Sybil's gives you an amazing selection of Guyanese food and baked goods, Veggie Castle is the sister who came back from college (somewhat) health conscience, cruelty free, and (mostly) Vegan. She isn't attending some liberal arts school though, definitely at culinary school, because she's got all the flavors! ""Cafeteria"" style service, a bain marie at the front counter holds all of your hopes and dreams. You can choose a small or large container, it's perfect as take out or to eat on the spot in their small seating area. As for the food itself I'm not even sure what anything really is, but it's literally all amazing. You would never know you aren't eating meat. The flavors are full but what sets apart these ""alternatives"" are their amazing textures. The drumsticks taste and chew just like chicken. It's almost bizarre.  They also serve vegan/vegetarian baked goods (the cakes look great) as well as a fully customizable smoothie bar which lists the health benefits of each ingredient or predesigned recipe. Free yourself from the routine of meat, heal yourself while escaping bland vegan options. Love yourself and stop by Veggie Castle II. **Get lucky! If your order receipt has a star on it, your meal is on the house! This happened to us on our first visit, after dining in we felt it was so good we decided to grab a container to go and it ended up free.","I've been waiting sooooooooooo long to come here. I finally got the chance to visit Veggie Castle last night for the first time. The storefront is small, the place gets busy at night (I was there 8:45 on a Thurs) but the line moves and the amount of people inside should not let you stray from waiting. My boyfriend and I split a large plate for under $15. It was 3 sides and 2 proteins, so you get a good variety. Portion sizes are very strong, and for two people it was some filling, wholesome eats. Their seating section is detached from the line, I didn't realize they had seating until after paying. I didn't know what to expect because I have just heard about Veggie Castle from WOM but I'm pretty impressed by everything there. They have a lot of sandwiches that look amazing that I want to go back for. If Queens wasn't out of my way I'd be at VC more often.",Veggie Castle II
383,"Went here for buffet and was disappointed. Their buffet only included fatty beef, lamb, some glass noodles, thick noodles you have to pay $1 for, and some other items. All vegetables must be paid extra, and other kinds of items. They sit you down ask you what type of base you want then hands you the check of list instead of handing the check off list first. If I knew this was going to happen, I wouldn't have had came here.",Came here for mother's day lunch. Last time I ate here was probably 7 or 8 years ago when they first opened. I think they have improved the service and taste.,"They are famous for the hotpot soup base.  If you haven't tried herb based soup this might be strange for you, there are other choices for you. you can select two soup base per pot.  Remember they charge per person for soup base not per pot.  New offer on  AYCE meat are limited to select type all other food items are still ala cart so do ask server to clarify for you. If you happen to be in the area during weekday lunch you can try their lunch set.","Been here several times and absolutely love it! I was introduced to hot pot when I lived in China. I was reluctant to have it, but once I did, fell in love. Delicious and this location is amazing. Very authentic to what I would get when away. Large selection or meats, veggies, noodles and more. My friend and I get the beef lamb combo for meat. It's large and perfect for us. We load up on veggies cause they're fresh and delicious. Love their noodles. Always get two orders. Helps that my daughter loves noodles. I love their shrimp balls too. We get the half and half pot. The spicy is so spicy but so good at the same time. Definitely try half and half don't be wimpy and only get mild. But I do love the mild soup. I drink so much! I also love their pork dumplings. Not hot pot, just boiled. They're delicious and I could eat a million of them. So good. The staff is always so nice. They're friendly and helpful. They'll answer questions and are very good at refilling drinks/ water. It's a nice clean restaurant. Modern look to it. And I just saw they have all you can eat Tuesday through Friday. It's limited options but yay! And I think it was advertised at like 17 bucks. Very reason. I'm excited to go.","This became me and my wife's favorite hot pot place. And here're reasons why:1. Staffs are great. When you're thinking about going to Chinese restaurant, probably one of few reasons makes you hesitate to visit would be their speaking. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean any disrespect; it's their accent from speak Chinese, which might sounds pretty aggressive even if they're trying to speak English as best as they can. This place, however, will giving you an impression that you are being treated at high end western restaurant. Indeed, not every staff members are fluent at English, but they are still gentle. Whenever we visit here, if they found out we can't speak Chinese, lady Becky always came to us and help us out. Believe me, their service quality deserve more than 5 star. 2. SoupHot pot. Hot. Spicy. That's like a stereotype we have. Try their half&half. We visited here several times and every time I went and grabbed some sauce, but I ended up less than a half. The soup by itself is the dish. It's warm, filling, healthy and tasty. They also offer to make it to go if you couldn't finish it. 3. FoodsIt doesn't need to be fresh for hot pot. But it's fresh. Veggies, meats, fries, whatever. Their lamb skewer is also out favorite. Well seasoned, cooked on-point. 4. PriceI believe I don't need to mention any about the price. It's such an amazing deal. I'm not a heavy yelper, so most likely I leave a review when I'm either really disappointed or really impressed. This is latter. Every single time we visiting here, the quality overall is so high and yet so constant.","Was in Flushing and craving hotpot so we decided to try Little Sheep, which is a well-known name place with several locations. First off, it's in a very crowded area and parking is a nightmare. If you park in the garage across the street it's $4 for 2 hours, which isn't too bad. Readily identifiable from the street, the interior has a sleek and modern design with open booths. They have lunch specials during the week, but as we were there on a Saturday we had the regular menu. It's a bit like some sushi places I've been to- everything is ordered ala carte and there's a paper menu they provide which has all the options and their individual price (seafood, meats, noodles, veggies etc). You mark which ones you want and the quantity, and the server verifies the order before it goes to the kitchen. The concept is designed so the entire table can share whatever is selected. There are two burners on each table so you can have two pots going at once. Pros:Food was tasty and fresh, good quality. Broth was very flavorful.Restaurant was very clean and had a nice ambience. Service was impeccable. The entire staff was friendly and made us feel welcome, they immediately bussed empty dishes and refilled both broth and drinks. Cons:Ala carte adds up pretty quickly- for four people (two children) and just enough food ordered, with no dessert and only water to drink, it was over $90 tip included. Sauce bar, while clean, did not have as many options as I've seen at other locations. Menu was somewhat limited. I prefer the buffet style hotpot where everyone can go up and choose what they want for an inclusive price. I would give it 4 stars just for the service but since you can't give half stars, I'm rounding down to 3. Good ambience, great service, tasty food, but somewhat limited selection. I enjoyed it and would return, but with other options out there I think I'll try them first.",Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot
384,"Food wasn't that good, severely over priced for ""special days"", ruined my mothers day as we were stuck at the front door on a cold rainy day. Requested a new table and was told they will look but never came back to even apologize for not being able to relocate us. Over all it was a horrible experience will not be returning. To top off our meal a 20% tip was added to our bill without our permission. Do yourself a favor and skip over this place especially if your a person of color....***Update they charged my card $290 without permission!!!!***","Ordered the meat platter. Compared to meat platters of many other Greek places in Queens,- taste was above average- meat wasn't dry, was decently prepared- for $28, I was expecting a lot more food. The amount of meat in this order was only enough for 1.5 gyros- the rice sucked. Maybe the other sides are better (I also actually asked for fries)Decent service. Overall, not worth; would go to other Greek places. This place isn't bad though.",Service terrible and it was empty. Food boring and overpriced. Disappointing.,"I've passed this place a bunch of times but I never stopped in to try the place. They are on a busy block area off of Austin Street so parking can be tough. I'm lucky enough that I am close enough for deliveries which they do. Ordered off Seamless and the delivery was quick and the food came still hot, so it was packaged right which is always great. The food was good. I got the meat platter which had a little bit of everything. Lamb, chicken, sausage, beef and I think one more. The pita bread and the sauce were very good. I'd like to try and eat in next time.","I haven't been to many Greek restaurants but I've had ""gyros"" from random places in the city/Queens.  I tried their beef gyro (take out) and it wasn't shaved off, the meat is in preformed rectangle pieces. It's decent. It was seasoned nicely the first time. The food just isn't consistent with the seasoning. It comes with shredded lettuce, onions and 2 sliced tomatoes on the side, so you can add everything or not. It also comes with a lil container of tzatziki. The tzatziki could use more flavor. It's really thick. Again, it won't be the best gyro, but it's not bad for the area. Forest hills seriously lacks good restaurants...it's just kinda pricey for food that's eh in the area.. L tried the chicken souvlaki and it was pretty dry. He didn't care for it, the sauce couldn't save it. We couldn't eat the entire thing. I liked their grape leaves appetizer. It was a lil lighter, not as sour as other Greek restaurants.This place is pretty busy during dinner hours. Like I said not that many ""great"" options in Forest Hills even though there is a lot of restaurants to choose from.","The textures and tastes were perfect. We also enjoyed the light Greek music and the dim lighting. Waiters were friendly and attentive.We ordered the feta cheese appetizer covered in sesame seeds with figs, tomatoes and a balsamic glaze. For main course, we had dorata with capers, with a side of string beans.",Agora Taverna
385,"This place was really handy for the cinema. Very fast service. The food was average, but what you'd expect for a quick bite before a movie (it's right next door to the cinema). Reasonably priced too.","A smaller version of the larger Manor Oktoberfest over on Yellowstone Blvd. If possible, make the trek out to the other location, as this one is much, much smaller and has less offerings. Not a bad place for some items, such as various German beers and some staples. Otherwise, it's a bit lacking.","If i could give 6 stars, i would.. service was great... food was awesome. I dont frequent Atlas Park but I'd come just to eat here again.","This was my first and will NOT be my last visit to Manor Oktoberfest. My daughter, girlfriend and her daughter decided to come to the Manor after we went to the Chili's. The Chili's wait was 45 mins to an hour. Our movie was due to start within that time frame. I made a suggestion to go to the Manor and everyone was on board. It is even more convenient because it's next door to the movie theater. There are tables and high tables lined neatly outside as you enter the Manor. The waiter was so polite my daughter said, ' Wow Mom he's really nice"". We waited 5 mins for a table, which is a record and were seated at a clean bench and chairs. While we decided on our orders the waiter came by to see what beverages we would like and gave us more time to decide on dinner. When the food arrived, (2) order of hot wings and fries and 1 order of chicken fingers and finally crab cakes it was served hot. The food was prepared and served to us with LOVE! everything was perfect and we truly had NO complaints. The waiter returned with ketchup, refills, honey mustard and a kind smile. Everyone was happy to have had great service and to be off to a movie night. Thank you Mano Oktoberfest.....see you soon!","First time here and loved it! I had been searching for something to eat in Atlas Park mall, and decided to try this place. Had bratwurst once before, and decided to see how well they would make it. I would definitely come here again.","Food is good. It is probably more bar food than restaurant food. We had the Wienershnitzel (ok), frankfurter on a roll (YUM), pastrami sandwich (not even close to Katz), and the Strudel (ok but not the best). Their selling point in their grapefruit beer (Hoff Schoff) and their reasonable prices.  Worth it if you live in the area? Yes? Drive here from somewhere else? Probably not.

I've only been here twice and he's always picking fights with everyone he comes into contact with. Never coming back.,"This place would be absolutely awesome even if it weren't for all the games they offer. The cocktails, the nuts, the decor, and the service are all on point.","I have been going to The Ditty since I moved to the area. It's still one of my favorite bars because of the good music, the games, and the overall atmosphere.I decided to throw myself a birthday party in the back room and I could not be happier with my decision. From the beginning, Tanya was extremely patient and very helpful throughout the entire planning process. I had many questions and she never made me feel like a nuisance and was always happy to offer her help.The day of the party, they allowed me to decorate the room as I wanted and play my own music. Everything I asked for appeared with no hesitation and I cannot explain how much easier this made everything.The food was outstanding and the drinks were always flowing. Shawn was very attentive to all of my guests and also went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. All my guests had a great time and were super impressed by the venue.Highly, highly recommend considering an event here.","Delicious and relaxing. This place is very well-priced for the hustle & bustle of the surrounding neighborhood. The staff is pleasant and efficient. The menu is limited and interesting and most importantly, fresh and not conventional. This is a solid brunch spot for a lazy, sunny sunday. Best enjoyed with friends, especially friends who don't mind being cozy with smaller tables or the laughter of kids and family board games.The food is simple and hits the spot. It's not amazingly unique or decadent or bougie--and that's the intention. You come here for the ease of a diner with the pomp & circumstance of a vibrant, quirk hipster sensibility. It's a tough balance to find but the Ditty does well straddling fun & affordable. The things I enjoyed most are not common sides on the menu but were too delightful not to mention -- a side of rustic sourdough bread as toast with butter and a small plate of fresh blueberries with a generous dollop of lemon cream! I am eager to come back and curious to experience how this place shifts across each season.","I love this spot. I probably came here 4 times already. The food isn't good at all and the most disappointing item were the fries. They couldve at least made the fries crunchy and not so nasty soggy. Anyways, the reason I go is because of the music. The crowd is very diverse and fun. Everyone minding their business, having a great time and little bit of dancing involved.",The Ditty
387,"After everyone raving about the fried fish cake, I made my way to try. It was popping hot but way too greasy. The fish cake were lack of texture. Very disappointed. Also had the dumplings trios noodle soup, it was ok. Nothing worth to write home about. The food were served in disposable bowls and plates. A big turn off for enjoyment. Used to be my favorite Cantonese noodles shop but sadly I may not return.","This fuking place don't accept card or transfer and just accepting cash. This is fuking stupid! I asked other people in the room whether I can get cash from them and transfer, and they are really indifferent and apathetic, refusing to do so even though they have 10$ cash. DAMN IT! It seems like that one's mother was gone and have to save cash to buy a coffin. Really a bad experience at this foolish restaurant and I wish never to come again.","Not a long winded review: There is pork in everything that is shrimp. The wontons, the dumplings. Pig meat is implied in most dishes. Just a heads up for non-pork eaters.",Best wonton noodles soup in town.  The wonton and egg noodles are cooked perfectly.  Second best to my mom's. Oh & don't forget the dried shrimp hot sauce.,"Sifu Chio (道記港式雲吞麵; something like Chio's Hong Kong Style Noodles), also known as Prince Noodle & Café -- the English name on the restaurant's signage -- is a Hong Kong style wonton noodle shop with an old-school, budget-friendly feel in Downtown Flushing. Food: OK (3 of 5). We had the following:- Dumpling Trio Lo Mein (三色餃撈麵): $9.- Duet Noodle Soup (雙星湯麵): $8.- ""Blanched Chinese Vegetable"" (Blanched Choy Sum; 油菜): $5.50. Worth getting only if you have an extra craving for choy sum, which are sufficiently represented in the noodle soups. Sifu Chio's wonton noodles are tossed in mix of oyster sauce and sesame oil, and are pretty good. Of the two dedicated wonton noodle shops now in Downtown Flushing -- Maxi's Noodles, which recently moved to a new location three short blocks away, is the other -- Sifu Chio presently has the better noodles (*), while Maxi's has the better wontons and dumplings. Maxi's wontons have a fresh ""crunch"" not present in wontons from Sifu Chio, though Sifu Chio's wontons and dumplings are still pretty good.Service and Atmosphere: OK (3 of 5). Sifu Chio is a small corner space, with six tables with four seats each. Everything is served using disposable dining ware -- disposable plates and bowls, chopsticks and spoons -- not environmentally friendly but par for course. Those with mobility concerns should keep in mind that the bathroom is down a flight of stairs. (*) This may be a short-term advantage, as Maxi's is in a shakedown phase getting used to its new location and customer volume. Sifu Chio has pretty good wonton noodles, but Maxi's Noodles has had wonton noodles made with duck eggs, which somehow made their noodles awesome.","At one point in time, I think Sifu Chio was a 5 star caliber wonton spot. Despite a change in ownership in the last few years, I still haven't found a dedicated place for straight Cantonese style wontons that is as good as this place. While the wontons were better circa 2013, this place is still a sure thing when it comes to wonton noodle staple.Back in the day, a bowl ran as low as $3.95 (#1) but inflation has caught up as now most bowls are in the $7-8 range. Instead of actual bowls, this place tends to go with the styrofoam or plastic bowls, which I suppose works well for situations where one doesn't finish the food. The wontons are very solid. Skin can get a bit thick at times, but I appreciate the ratio of shrimp to meat for the combo ones. My favorite ones to order at the trio wontons with noodles in soup (三色餃湯麵), which I think is the best value amongst all the combinations. The soup base was tastier at one point, but I think the noodles and wontons are still within range of tastiness.And while wontons get all the press, they also make a killer set of fish balls, fish cakes, and dumplings. The latter is not my favorite and really never has been, mainly due to the doughiness of the skin and the fact it's not really crispy for the pan fried ones. The fried wonton (炸餛吞) is fun to eat, but without noodles or soup; they work ideally on their own like an appetizer.And the extra star goes to the fact they serve congee. Not just any congee, but flavored congee with options like carp or minced beef and the ever classic ""lean pork"" with black egg (皮蛋瘦肉粥). They also rock the beef brisket as well, but only for a $3 extra. I also think their lo mein is actually somewhat underrated as their dry noodle combinations are an excellent option for lunch.Lastly, it's a cash only business (#2) and the staff is pretty friendly. They are one of the very few Cantonese speaking businesses and seem to take delight when patrons are the same way. There is never a bad time to come here. Lunch might seem like the logical choice, but I've had plenty of solo meals during dinner time. It's never all that busy and they have just enough tables to keep a small crowd in here at all times. ____________(#1) Pretty insane how expensive Flushing has become. Even Peking Duck Buns were .50 cents a pop.(#2) Welcome to Flushing.",Sifu Chio

When you treat ppl like shit remember you'll get it right back !","My wife and I decided to try Keuka since we wanted to go out for a bite and wine. The place is quite small which was fine, as it was nearly empty. The woman working was a bit abrasive. We weren't ready to order wine after two minutes of looking over the menu and she clearly showed she was annoyed. Once we said we were ready to order drinks, I told her what I wanted and then she just walked away before asking my wife what she would like. The cheese and meat board was better than expected but the menu is all over the place. Tone it down on the roasted red peppers! For the size of the restaurant, the menu is double the size it should be. Make it more quaint, offer 4-5 apps and 4-5 entrees. Not a million categories. It wasn't really worth the money so we won't be going back.",I wish I could give this place a 0 star.  Service stinks especially with the male bartender.  It takes them forever to bring the food out and it doesn't matter if the place is empty or full.  Ollie the owner doesn't even care when you give him constructive feedback - and I've been going there since they first opened.  The food is consistently inconsistent.   Maybe because there's such a high turnover in the kitchen? Poorly managed spot.  I will go out of my way to avoid them henceforth.,"Came here tonight to check out this little gem in Forest Hills.  The place is very quaint, nice for a date or date night with  your husband.  I had a glass of nice red wine from the Finger Lakes wines - Lakewood  Very yummy!

The update I got was that it would be 8:30-8:50. The food arrived at 8:15. The food came in microwavable containers. Two containers each of tamarind sauce and cilantro/mint chutney. There were four samosas total, which is more than I expected for the price. A container of rice as well. The food tasted great, though unfortunately the chicken was dry.","Had lunch at Aroma Indian Cuisine on Sunday afternoon. An adequate option for Indian food, but the only part of the meal that was excellent was the cilantro chutney.Quality: Aroma Indian Cuisine is a solid spot that will help your Indian fix. My meal started with a Chicken Samosa. While the samosa itself was just okay, the cilantro chutney it came with was fantastic. I would love to douse everything I eat in it. Shortly after came my Chicken Tikka Masala and Garlic Naan. The Garlic Naan was a huge disappointment. Lacking in flavor and too chewy, make sure you have rice for your gravy dishes, because it will not work as a substitute. The Chicken Tikka Masala was good, but not good enough to eat until I was stuffed. The consistency of the chicken was remarkable and probably the best part of the dish. The problem was the sauce was overly sweet. It needed more depth of flavor and more heat. Maybe we didn't give it enough to stew by arriving for an early lunch.Quantity: Each of the dishes I ordered was large enough to share. The mains are huge and easily two meals.Value: $3 for Chicken Samosas. $4 for Garlic Naan. $14 for Chicken Tikka Masala.Ambiance: Aroma Indian Cuisine is located in Rego Park, Queens. The unassuming shop sits on Woodhaven Blvd. The decor is non-existent and if not for the music, I would have no idea what kind of restaurant I was visiting. The one odd feature was a sliding barn door separating it from the business next door, which would occasional allow a staff member to sneak through.Crowd: We were the first to arrive for Sunday lunch, but slowly other guests trickled in.Service: Our waitress was great and the food out was fairly quick. They also did an excellent job packing up our leftovers.Parking: Street parking could be found nearby.",Aroma Indian Cuisine
390,"*link your CC to your yelp profile to get 5% cash back when dining here*It's a pretty spacious café, with plenty of seating on the inside. Minimal parking in their front lot (probably can fit 5 cars max). The food here comes out fast, but there is nothing very memorable about the place. I had the beef noodle soup ($6.95) and they ran out of the thick white noodles and had to substitute with the thin yellow egg noodles. Also, the beef chunks in the noodle soup were not very beefy, they were mostly beef tendons which I am not a fan of, so the stock photo in the menu is deceiving! Prices are in line for what you expect at a sit down restaurant, but I think I rather walk a few blocks up to the food court and have delicious beef noodle soup, with beef pieces for $5 instead.",Second time here. Just ordered take out today. Food are good. But the portion for the noodle inside for the duck noodle is ridiculously little. If you think you charge to cheap for the order. Bring up the price. Give a reasonable size for a order. Now I have to go back out and buy more food. Definitely will not go bak anytime soon,"Totally agree with Betty L that the food here is very bland and in addition to that, VERY OILY TOO! The husband and I shared a beef Chow fun and Shanghai noodle with our daughter. The food was so bad that I had didn't wanna continue eating. The noodles were so oily that I had to use a napkin to wipe off the oil before feeding my daughter. Ugh! It was a lot of work just for lunch too! We also shared a siu Mai thinking that they can't mess this dimsum up but we were wrong. The siu Mai tasted rather strange and horrible per the husband. It didn't have any seasoning with one piece of shrimp in the bottom and you can only taste the meat. It was definitely NOT a typical dim sum siu Mai #facepalmWhat we can't believe is how badly they messed up on a Hong Kong classic dish, BEEF CHOW FUN, when the name of this restaurant is HK Cafe! #sighduck Won't be returning even if they have the special lunch and dinner deals which we opted out of. Super MEH!","Dinner on a Sunday at 6pm: Got a table as soon as we walked in. The place was quite spacious and good for big groups. Price was fair and the food was delicious. Dishes came out pretty quickly upon ordering. OMG, I haven't had a  good peking style pork chop for quite some time and this place delivered it. (I always request peking style pork chop every time I go to a cantonese restaurant.) The sauce had the perfect acidity; it was not overly sour or too sweet. The meat was juicy, thin, and crispy. It wasn' thick, fatty, or overpowdered. It was....done right. I'm so in love. Next time I'm here, I would love to try their salt and pepper pork chop. Almost every table in the restaurant ordered their cage free chicken. It was juicy and tender. The dish came with the ginger and scallion sauce and they gave you a generous amount. My dad and I really appreciate it because we love to pair it up with a bowl of rice. Your taste buds will thank you. The waiters were friendly and attentive.

I really wanted it to be amazing but it was just fine. The menu is very extensive with all the greatest hits - got all your Chinese/ hk favorites like tomato pork baked rice, beef hall fun, lobster sticky rice, mayo shrimp. There's also dim sum. Portions were good. But the quality and flavor was mediocre. We ordered half a chicken (guess it's one of their signature dish. All the tables got half or full chicken) again, it was fine. Not the best I've ever had, or very good.. but it was not bad The service was pretty good, and food came out super fastThe parking lot outside is a bit unique... it's two rows of parking.

The outside of this restaurant looks unassuming and you'd easily miss it but don't judge a book by its cover because the food is delicious! Some of the items I really liked are also found on the menu too.We started with an assorted sashimi platter, which tasted super fresh especially the sweet shrimp and geoduck. We also had the pan fried fish and chopped chicken which were also deliciously flavorful! My favorite dish out of everything we tried had to be the lobster glutinous rice and i've never tried anything like this! The lobster was succulent and the rice had great texture and a rich seafood flavor. Eating the lobster was also pretty mess-free because of they way they chopped it into pieces. At the end of our meal, I had a HK style milk tea and this one really hit the spot for me. Overall, this is a reliable spot for Chinese food. I can't wait to be back.",Hk Cafe
391,"So sad. Walked forty minutes to find out the kitchen was closed. Had a vegan fix I needed and I thought this place could do it. They would make so much more money if they kept their kitchen open. It's a silly looking bar with a sillier name. Middle aged men pretending to be 23 serving drinks. Cheap. Not too cheap though. The crowd definitely is what you'd expect; an eclectic hodgepodge with one thing in common, alcohol and ostentatious standoffishness. Must be something in the water!","5 star brunch atmosphere!!-(but our experience was just fine.) Walked in at 11am on a super busy Sunday, tables filled with people and a live band! We took an open table and ordered coffees while looking over the menu. While ordering our meals, we were told Brunch menu items can't be modified, and that we'd only be able to add things, so I'm assuming things were not made to order(?). Sucks, as I was having brunch with a vegetarian and someone with multiple food allergies. They did have a few vegetarian options, but we wouldn't be able to customize items without meat, so choices were very limited. (tragic.) My friend with allergies originally wanted to order an item, asking it be made without avocados- but they couldn't do that for him so he ordered the biscuits. My boyfriend (vegetarian) ordered a breakfast burrito, they offered the chorizo add for meat eaters. I ordered the mushroom hash and added two poached eggs. For being pre-made or whatever the case, the food took a bit of time to come out. The server accidentally brought my boyfriend the burrito with chorizo, which he wouldn't have realized it had meat had I not tasted it first. Would've been unfortunate. :( My food -the mushroom hash- looked boring and plain with the arugula and greens on top, HOWEVER, the flavors of the beets and runny eggs and hashbrowns (with a ton of hot sauce) is something I still dream about today!! And with all the greens on my plate, it made it seem guilt free. hehe. My meal was very filling. If I ever have the time to make it back to Father's, I would order the hash again and try the chorizo patties add on. Thanks, Father's !!!","Not ADA accessible. To enter there's a step, should have a ramp option to get in. Once you're in, all the tables are high top stools. There is one lower table in the back...but it's on a platform.

For those not born in the 80's, that's the intro song for the hit show Cheers. Well that's what plays in my head each and every time I walk into Father Knows Best. I've been coming here at least one night a week, for the last three years. This morning however, was my first time 'working from from home' so I decided to bring my laptop here and grab me an ice coffee. I was a bit nervous thinking I wouldn't be productive but to my surprise, I felt like I walked into a hip WeWork as there were about 15 others doing the same, all locked in their zone, and typing away on their laptops. Whether it's a Monday morning or a Saturday night, I highly recommend Fathers. Pro tip #1: Ask for Greg, he makes a mean Old Fashion. Prop tip #2: Located right off the Wilson stop on L train and they have a digital sign that tells you how far the next train is (I need one for my apartment!).",Father Knows Best
392,"I ordered the chicken with sriracha honey burger. It came out horrible. The bread was stale and frozen and I can't even bit nor cut through the chicken. I told the waiter, and he brought back another bread when I told him I didn't need it anymore.I would stick to noodles/rice next time","Seafood tasted fresh but the sauce is pretty disgusting. Not what you'd expect if you've been to other Cajun Vietnamese boil places. It's a congealed mess with almost no old bay, lemon, garlic, or butter flavor. There's so much corn starch in it, the consistency is like jello. Very unsatisfied with the meal and the cost.",We were here for dinner a few times with no disappointments. Food portion are good and the taste is just right!,Oh my gawd! Luv luv luv this place! I've been there 4 times so far. I'm constantly bringing people over there and no one ever gets disappointed. I love how they will tell you when they have specials. It gets yummier!!! I usually order the lobster boil and they had a crab special I could add for an extra $5!!!!,"My friend and I were seated immediately for dinner during a weekday. The service wasn't great. Food and portion sizes were decent. - Grilled Chicken Salad: Average. The dark chicken meat was very greasy. Otherwise the flavor was great. The dressing was slightly tart and sweet. - Raw Oysters/Clams: I'd say skip. They were definitely not fresh but okay for a place in Flushing. - Shrimp/Mussel Seafood Boil: Pretty good. The bowl was huge and perfect for sharing. There were plenty of large mussels, shrimps and mini corn cobs, potatoes and sliced sausages. The sauce was very glutinous. Not too salty or spicy even though we asked for the whole combination of sauces.","Imagine my surprise when this place I had walked by so many times and thought was just another Asian Cajun seafood boil place (I'm partial to Boiling Crab and rarely try other places in this genre) turned out to have a Hong Kong Cafe menu.I'm a huge fan of the Hong Kong cafe standard baked rice dishes with white sauce.  Dynamite Seafood as multiple choices including the baked pork chop version, but since this was a seafood place, I went with the baked seafood with white sauce over rice.I knew it was going to be great the moment they brought it out.  The sauce was flavorful and they had nicely browned the top.  The rice was a nicely seasoned fried rice, although I could have done without the frozen peas and carrots they added to the rice.  There was a tiny bit of egg in the fried rice, but not enough.  I was impressed by how much seafood came with it.  There were multiple mussels and clams.  There were two really large butterfly shrimp.  And I was surprised when I realized there were a couple fish fillets hidden under the sauce.  It was such a comforting meal.  Aside from the peas and carrots, my only problem with the dish was that the mussels and clams were a bit overcooked due to the baking of the dish to brown the top.  They should consider adding the mussels and clams partway through the baking so that they're better cooked in the final product.  Still, it was a really satisfying experience.To start, I got the clam chowder.  For $4.95, it was a really big bowl of clam chowder with plenty of clams, potatoes, and celery.  I had sort of half expected them to just use premade chowder, but this clam chowder seemed to be be made in-house.  It came with this nice crispy bread stick.I had the Hong Kong style hot milk tea as well, which completes the cafe experience and only costs $1.50.Getting good Hong Kong cafe food is difficult in New York.  This place does a fantastic job with the baked rice dishes.  I'm definitely returning for these rice dishes.",Dynamite Seafood
393,nice atmospherethey have trivia tuesday nights and i believe karoke,This place is the sh*t!!! And I've noticed the trend of who gives negative reviews yea stay on that side of town if Neir's is not good for you. Neir's 4 life!!,this has been my worst experience ever at a bar. The female caucasian bartender was extremely racist and rude and basically tried to kick me out when the bar wasnt close for another hour or so. After I posted my google review she then tried to discredit my review. DISGUSTING PEOPLE GUYS. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTUNG. I wish no one is treated the way that I was. I wish I had never spent any money there. They will go out of business soon.The owner tries to cover up their shitty service by pretending to care and giving you their email. But it's all fake. Dont go here guys.,"I'm a Goodfellas geek - have seen the movie over 50 times  - my favorite movie of all time - so, when I was in Queens on business, had to stop at the Christmas scene bar....My night was made when a local (forgot his name) saw me taking pictures as I walked in, knew what I was doing, and looked at me opened his arms and said, ""Hey..come here....come here you......"" (here's scene....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCQRvfWvdt8)Instantly made me feel welcome - got a burger - solid, better than your usual bar food....beers were reasonable, the bartender (Lisa?) was awesome......made my whole work week trip! Coming back to area around Christmas - I'll be back!!!!","What a treasure, this place. Bit of solitude in a true neighborhood and a place where you can enjoy a pint and the company of a patron or two and the bartender, in my case a young lady who was happy to chat everyone up, ask their name, if they were visiting, etc. You may know the story of the place, and I don't need to retell it. If you're coming expecting to be bowled over that might not be a realistic thing to do. If you're looking for a great place to kick back and relax, enjoy a brew or two or some food, yea, now you're talking.Of course there are untold numbers of places to have a drink in this area of town and they come and go, but Neir's, it just keeps on going. Maybe you're great-great grandfather had a pint here. We'll never know. Hoping my great great grandchild, assuming I ever have one, gets to make a stop here. 5 stars? Getouttahereyabum! They'll have nothing of it. Best place to have a quiet pint in the city that I've found.","Came here with a ticket from the Queens Beer Book.Come for the history, food and drinks, stay for the hospitality. The bar was founded in 1829 and is supposed to be one of the oldest bars in the country. It has an extensive bar, a dining area in the back and a small stage. The bartender, I think her name was Nicole, was very quick, friendly and accommodating. I ordered a Brooklyn Defender IPA, which was almost a perfect pour. I salute her for that. To eat, I ordered the fish and chips which came out piping hot from the kitchen. It came with fries that were well seasoned and crunchy. Afterwards, I ended my meal with a Mai Tai. It was fruity and delicious, and came served in a big mason jar. This was a schlep, but I would definitely return. Everything as a whole was great.",Neir's Tavern

Finally just got up and left.",Best Italian in LIC.  Too bad it's in an awkward location.  Don't let that stop you!,"$6 for a lb of iceberg lettuce and 2 halved tomato slices. No olives, a few giant chunks of onion and i dare anyone to locate the cucumber (the lonely 1/3 slice IS in the photo). Come on... this is embarrassing even for a free house salad.

The food is very good.The service was excellent and the staff is very friendly.We planned on going this past Sunday and then realized they are closed on Sunday.We plan on going again this Saturday with relatives visiting from California.This is definitely on our list of favorite dining spots!,"Ambience is quite typical Italian and tables are a little small but this is understandable in NYC.Waiter is responsive and quick in helping to identify which foods are best suited for our needs.The pasta is one of the most perfectly cooked and timed pasta I've ever eaten. The texture was just right .I ordered Linguine Pescatora. Although the pasta was great, there were not enough shrimps and the texture of the shrimps are not firm enough. Too much squids.Wine was great.","Went here with my friend for dinner after trying to go to another restaurant that had a ridiculous wait. Happy we went here, had a great time.We ordered red wine which was delicious. I had the squid ink black pasta which was delicious and well seasoned. I really enjoyed it.

395,"As a person who doesn't usually like American breakfast, it's crazy to think that Java Day could make me crave their breakfast menu so much!! My go-tos are Ginger Peach Iced Tea w/ honey & their California omelet platter!! Their staff are also super friendly. Only downside is that they close at 4 pm :( but if you're a morning/ working person, they open at 6 AM!","As a person who doesn't usually like American breakfast, it's crazy to think that Java Day could make me crave their breakfast menu so much!!

No waitstaff and we were told they don't trust they're customers won't throw out cutlery and plates. I'd give them 5 stars if they went with melamine serve-ware or bamboo to help the environment, instead of the cheap paper.","This place is so good I can't believe I am only just discovering it! Cheap breakfast/brunch food, big portions, delicious eggs packed with flavor and in all different varieties.I got the Cajun omelette platter which comes with hash browns and toast and my friend got the egg trap (hash browns wrapped in a pillowy omelette). They both tasted amazing. They leave hot sauce and ketchup at the table which was perfect for me. This place is absolutely perfect for a quick breakfast bite with a close friend. It's not a fancy sit down breakfast but I like that it's not because I often just wanna get my morning grub and get going. Highly recommend if you are looking for great breakfast in flushing!","Cute, Kind, Tasty The restaurant had a fair number of seats for it's size. I was quite pleased with the service that we received. It's a casual and cozy spot where you can expect what I would consider fairly traditional American breakfast. I decided to try the stuffed cream cheese strawberry French toast. While it wasn't my favorite I still appreciated it for what it was. For me it felt just a tad too sweet with the strawberry cream cheese on top of regular strawberries I needed a little more contrast. I still thought it was pretty good and ate it all up. I genuinely just appreciated the hospitality of the staff. We asked for sliced lemons and they walked over and brought some almost right away. They worked with our party size and said they would get us a table as soon as they could. They have a cute restaurant with fair prices and lovely décor. I would feel more than comfortable recommending is it as a safe option if you aren't looking for anything too crazy for breakfast.","Decided to try this place for brunchhhh - plenty of seating and a nice family feel to it Overall, a little too much oil for the food but really satisfying and delicious if craving American diner food - prices are also really good The Elvis Sandwich was a combo I never thought would go well together - peanut butter, banana, bacon, and honey. It was surprisingly good with the savory bacon and sweet and nutty banana and peanut butter accompanying each other - a bit heavy though Western omelet was good - had a decent amount inside but I wish they had an option for it to be just an omelet without having it to be on a bagel/roll or pay an extra $2.75 to have it come with a platterI highly recommend the B4 platter if ur a meat lover since this came with all 3 breakfast meats - bacon, ham, and sausage. The home fries weren't crispy (except for the few I managed to find) but they were seasoned nicely.  Chai latte had a lot of milk making it sweeter than preferred but it def had the chai taste - iced green tea latte had a good matcha taste and the iced latte pleased my dad after asking for it to be less sweet",Java Day Cafe

Customer gets ignored, lime soda made out of fake lime, dosa without any flavors, and masala tea without masala. It took over 20min to get a bill and there were only 5people in a restaurant.","The food is delicious, they spend a little bit to give you your dish, but once you have it, you realize why they spend that time.","One of my fav lunch spots in Jackson heights. Food is authentic (I am Indian), service is fine, and they serve good beers. Prices are super reasonable and there's always seating available. The food is delicious - trying to get my friends to make the trek out here with me so I can try more things on the menu! I always go for the idli and dosa comboBonus: they take credit card and are 1-2 blocks from the subway","Another amazing vegetarian Indian spot in the heart of Jackson Heights! Saumdra may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I found it pleasant, simple, and delicious. As a South Asian, my taste buds naturally crave for more sodium. I understand that not all nationalities intake as much sodium as I do, with that said, I will say do not feel the need to leave a bad review because of the lack of salt.The interior is very simple, yet so classy. This isn't your upscale fine dining, but rather casual dining. The waitstaff is very attentive, which really shocked me, because normally in Jackson Heights, I hardly find good waiters. The food was served promptly and while that will draw red flags, it was fresh. We got Paneer Pakoras, Chaana Bature, and Mumbai Pav Bhaaji. I ate the Paneer Pakoras and I was done. It filled me up to the point I slept in the car for 20 minutes! Add the Pav Bhaaji and it will knock out. The chaana bature, well slightly overwhelming because of the lack of salt and also the poori was too thick. Nonethless, between service and the remaining two dishes, the chaana bature was forgotten. I definitely recommend this place, the dishes are reasonably priced so you won't break your wallet, and best of all, it was savory. Stop by when you can, I recommend Lunch, and have some vegetarian food to give a kick in your palette!","We wanted to have Indian food while we were leaving LaGuardia and google said there is a paradise biryani pointe nearby. After parking we found it's not there. We saw Samudra in front. It's a pure veg restaurant. We thought of giving it a try.There were couple of customers. We sat ourselves in one of the empty tables. Soon a lady came and gave the menus. It took a while to understand who are the waiting staff but then someone gave us water and another menu.

Then I saw another table went to the counter to pay so we thought that's how it should be done. So we went to the counter. Then the lady started writing bill after bill and talking to her staff in Hindi. That irritated me a bit. I'm standing right there, it's not my problem that others asked for the bill. You didn't show up at our table to give the bill so we are here.Anyways all in all since food was great, I would rate my experience as 4/5.",Samudra Vegetarian Restaurant & Chaat House
397,My husband loves the cheese cake factory so much and we come at least once a month. Our favorite dishes are their French toast and chicken & waffle Benedict eggs which are only provided in the weekend on brunch menu. Their complimentary bread as everyone knows is also great but sometimes they forget to serve due to lack of service which is the only thing we want to complain.,"Came here for a quick meal and it was decent. Nothing too special. I got the flatbread and some parts were a bit burned. My friend got the southern chicken sandwich and it was ok--a bit spicy. The server was friendly but did not check on us often. Moreover, the line in the bathroom was backed up because there was only one stall with toilet paper and it was a little messy so I guess they don't clean it frequently. Overall it was an average experience. Their cheesecakes looked really good though.",Save your money and go somewhere else where your money and appetite is worth. This  used to be my favorite place but it totally fell off. Maybe it's because of  new management or lack of. They don't give you bread unless you have a party of 3 or more. The female servers are very rude and nasty. I had several occasions where the female servers banged my glass beverage at my table and the beverage splashed all over me and she didn't even say sorry. The other female server shoves a hot plate at my sisters face and has the nerve to tell her place it on the table herself. The other female server had the worst attitude and got annoyed because I as a customer asked her for extra plates and forks. What a way to get tips right?,"In the area one afternoon & we figured why not come in here & give this place a try. We came in & were seated right away, drinks just had some ginger ale, not bad. They start u off with the Bread Basket not bad good bread nice & warm , Appetizers we gave the Simosas a try these were very good great with the dipping sauce. Main dish I had the Chicken Piccata this comes with pasta the chicken itself was not that great it didn't have any flavor just tasted like butter.  The pasta was good in the sauce.  My company had the Truffle Honey Fried Chicken comes with mash potatoes & asparagus chicken itself was good nice taste but didn't really taste like truffle at all could use more truffle taste , decent mash potatoes. So many cheesecakes to try but no room left, maybe next time. Restaurant itself is a good size typical Cheesecake Factory decor, service was not bad but a bit slow.. our waitress seemed to have way too much going on & forgot to bring stuff out. Price wise ok & normal to the chain, overall decent meal there's always room for improvement.","This was my first time at this new location at Queens Center Mall. We were seated outdoor which felt amazing at first until the weather got warmer.  The screens were lowered to turn the AC, but never felt the AC until we were leaving. Our appetizer and main course arrived at the same time, which I hate when that happens at a restaurant. The food was eatable, but was lackluster in seasoning. They gave my sister the wrong pasta dish, the supervisor removed it from the bill and offered her another dish. The second dish was much better than the first one. My staple appetizer is always the avocado egg rolls, but at this location it was not that great. The avocado was not firm enough inside the egg roll. My spicy chicken sandwich wasn't spicy all at. I am huge a fan of the cheese cake factory, but this location didn't do it for me. The food was too bland. The only thing I had like was the lemonade it was sweet with a hint of tartness which made it so delicious and refreshing. The one in Garden City the food is always delicious and amazing.","Was by Queens Center mall and I seized the opportunity to try Cheesecake factory for the 1st time. Was seated right away, and chose the chicken simosas as our appetizer. The crust was very light and they were quite tasty. My company ordered the chicken piccata w/angel hair pasta, the chicken was cooked well but it was overpowered with a buttery taste. I ordered the truffle honey chicken w/mashed potatoes & asparagus, I did not taste any truffle, was like eating chicken coated in honey batter. It wasnt bad but I chose it for the truffle taste.Was so tempted to get a cheesecake slice,  which they have many choices of, but already felt full. Overall not a bad location and the service was satisfactory.",The Cheesecake Factory
398,"Ordered a chicken burrito. Pros: It was prepared quickly. The interior of the place is nice. Cons: The burrito was expensive, but also was very small. Bad combination. They didn't put guacamole on it like the menu said. The rice was bad: more of a parboiled boxed rice than authentic Mexican rice. The burrito was oversalted. The shoestring fries were INCREDIBLY oversalted. And in case you've forgotten, the burrito was very small, so there were more of these awful potatoes than there was mediocre burrito. I still want my guacamole. Or like $2 back. Don't go here.",Food was decent.Drinks were good.Service was decent.Good non chain place for the area.,Food is not all of that. I ordered the shrimp taco and the shrimp was hard... i wasn't satisfied with the tacos so i ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was the same. The drinks are good though,Been here a few times and have ordered delivery as well and have had pretty good experiences. It's a little on the pricier side for the portions you receive for tacos but they're good (love the octopus tacos). Also if you like nachos you need to order them because they are OUT OF THIS WORLD and the plate is massive so definitely share.,"I have been here before with coworkers and Tacuba is just a solid place that does good food right. Their HH isn't anything to rave about but they do have one that we always take advantage of so I can't complain too much on that. Decided to sit down this time around and have some food from their menu. We ordered the chips and guac which came with a nice side salsa. I think this was a great bang for our buck, large order of chips and guac for the price which in other places usually isn't the case. We also ordered a chicken quesadilla. I was not a fan at all! Dry chicken served open face, think more pizza than quesadilla. I wouldn't order it again. Our server was a little annoyed that we weren't ordering a lot of food but did order a few round of drinks. You could tell she was annoyed but we did tip right so at the end of the day is what it is.",Fun Mexican spot in Astoria for drinks and/or food. Great for groups as it is big and often loud when full.  Passion fruit margharita was delicious and the tacos have always been good. The side of rice and beans is also a larger portion than a lot of places which I appreciate.,Tacuba
399,"Every time I order form this place, the food is great.A+","I realize this review might be unpopular. I ordered a Greek Salad last week and within a huge salad (that was $16 after I added chicken) I literally received one small block of feta, and an absurd amount of tomatoes and cucumbers (see my my picture). I just find it ridiculous to be charged close to $20 for a salad when it's all vegetable. My boyfriend ordered a gyro and it was so greasy, the entire outside wrapping paper was soaked. I will definitely give the restaurant another try but I didn't enjoy this experience at all.","This review is strictly for the food and is my personal opinion. There is nothing wrong with Brothers and I wouldn't suggest you should not go. Very friendly staff. Water brought and poured again and again without asking. Complimentary bread (not pita) with olives and tzatziki was a nice touch. Red house wine is poor, harsh, sour on the palate. Grilled octopus looked so good In photos on Yelp but at $22 we decided not to try it. Small Greek salad was enough for 2 but feta cheese tasted like a band aid. No lamb gyros. Only pork and chicken. IMHO putting meat into pita does not make a gyro. The meat BTW was dry both in the pork gyro and the chicken and pork combo platter that my husband had. Charged .75 cents for extra tzatziki. Not necessary when we ordered drinks and dinners. Again, nice place, friendly service but with so many choices for Greek in Astoria we will not be back.","This place slogan should be: ""When you're here you're family!"" What a delight, service was great, the food delicious and everyone there, customers and staff alike talked and hugged like they have known each other a lifetime! We just witness the hostess greet and chat with passerby's and people would just peer in to say Hi! It was like being in a small Mediterranean village. I am so loving the switch we did from Brooklyn to Astoria, Queens. Life here is so less phony and more neighborhood like. Community is the word that comes to mind, and Brothers Taverna serves that in a warm delicious plate.BTW - I had the Mix Platter :)",We came here the other day for dinner and it was absolutely amazing!Pros:+ Incredible variety+ Amazing appetizers+ Gorgeous decor+ Half bottles/carafes of wine - I have to say this is a nice touch for those that don't want too much wine.+ Great greek food+ Incredible service - we were trying to stick to keto and the staff did an amazing job making numerous alterations to help us keep things Keto friendly.Cons:- Limited parking nearby,"Brothers Taverna is a gem in the heart of Astoria. With excellent Greek, Albanian and Mediterranean dishes, you'll feel like you're in someone's home. They have excellent appetizers like the grilled octopus (I don't know how they get it so tender), homemade hummus, and spicy feta cheese dip. The marinated mixed meat platter is a 'must' for its tender, juicy meats and chicken.  My Vegetarian friends can find plenty to eat like the quinoa salad with spinach and beets. I can't get enough of their traditional cornbread and homemade desserts. The bar makes great drinks and nice wine too and the vibe is cool and casual.

I am still thinking about the pulled pork in the mami arepa at this moment with my mouth watering. There are two sauces on the table. One like a hot sauce and the other called a Venezuelan Guacamole which tasted like an avocado ranch and was creamy. SOO DELICIOUS. my husband LOVED the hot sauce. I LOVED the creamier sauce. Not only was the food delicious but the atmosphere was nice. I'm pregnant so unfortunately I couldn't enjoy a cocktail but the margaritas looked delicious. There was Latin music playing and TVs to watch tennis, soccer. It looked family owned. There were two adorable kiddos helping bring waters to the table etc. put a smile on my face. Service was quick. Food was out quick. No wait for table. My husband and I are new to NYC and are already talking about bringing family back here to try. We are already talking about the next menu item we will try when we return.",Arepas Grill
401,"I've been working across the street for the past three years, and I've ordered with my coworker multiple times. We've contributed to their business time and again. The food is pretty good, and a healthier, cheaper alternative to what's available on the strip.So why is the review one star? It is because of the terrible customer service! The short, elderly woman who answers the phone is absolutely out of her mind. She is so rude! Every single order is always a battle, but today's experience really took the cake.When we called today, we were told we could not use a credit card number to order over the phone because they were worried we were going to up and run off with $30 of food. Why? Their reasoning was because our building lease will be up soon. How absurd is that?? First off, that is untrue. Secondly, we have been ordering for years, and years and we are not strangers. We've never once paid a cent less than what we owed. So because of their bad experience with one bad customer who works in the same building, they have stopped all orders. You would think they would treat a repeat customer better, but despite years of honest ordering, we are accused of being a flight risk with paying a $30 meal??Green Zenphony, you have lost hundreds of dollars. We used to tell coworkers about your restaurant and order a few times a month, but never again. Shame on you, and shame on that crabby old woman who can't work beyond her bias towards people she doesn't like and people she prefers.","I went with my family around 4 o'clock on a Thursday. However, service was subpar given that we were the only customers there. We ordered tea that took 10 minutes to get to us and the waitress seemed clueless when we asked about certain dishes.The food came fairly quickly and we were satisfied with the quantity. Everyone ate their fill and we brought the leftovers home. We also ordered another order of the cedar appetizer. The total came to around $80 for four people",Omg found a fly in my house special pan fried noodles! Absolutely disgusted! Owner or the woman who picks up the phone in the reception was rude as well. She doesn't know how to speak to customers. Ugh I usually love this restaurant's vegan food but this is just disgusting! DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT. My dad is a chef at a restaurant as well and I would never ever post a bad review and pull down someone's business but this just calls for a serious hygiene check! Not ever going to order from them again.,"Honestly, what a great random find. Food is great, super light, and tons of great options. Happy to have found this gem in this area!","I've come here for lunch a few times now, and it's always a decent meal. I like the fact that it's all vegetarian options and you never feel greasy and fell after eating here like other Chinese food spots. The staff is always welcoming and friendly as well, although sometimes they can be a little....""pushy"" when it comes to ordering. But I respect the hustle.-Vegetable Dumplings: 3.5/5, these are pretty good although they tend to be a bit bland. I prefer dumplings steamed but sometimes these fall apart on the plate so you're just eating the empty dumpling. Next time I'll probably try something different.-General Tso's soy protein chicken: 4/5, I really like this dish. It's typically served with some rice, mushrooms, onion, & green pepper. There could definitely be more ""chicken"" because they're always a bit light on the portion but it is pretty damn delicious. -Hot & Sour Soup: 2/5, with the lunch special this is one of the soup options. It's always a hit or miss when ordering this but it's usually a miss here unfortunately. Very bland and watered down with not much flavor at all. I'd recommend trying one of the other options unless bland & watery is your thing.-Mango Pudding: 2/5, I love anything mango, so naturally I had to try the mango pudding. Unfortunately it was pretty much a slab of mango gelatin scooped right out of a can and thrown on a plate with a few strawberry's. Bit of letdown, and I wouldn't get it again.Overall I like this spot once in a while when I'm in the mood for Asian vegetarian. But it's not a place I go out of my way for. The lunch specials are very reasonably priced but the portions are a bit small, which is actually a good thing in a way since you don't leave feeling like a fat slob. I'll probably have a few more meals here before the end of 2019 but I don't plan on becoming a regular in this lifetime.",Amazing!!! I ordered the pork fried rice and could not even tell the difference!  all the alternative to meats and grateful for restaurants like this!,Green Zenphony
402,"I was SO excited to finally try this place. Whomp whomp. Not great at all.The service was good but the food was not.   Meat was so tough, rice was BLAND, however the fried yuca was good.$8 piña coladas. Yes please. And those were delicious!Decor and ambiance. Meh.  Oh and it was FREEZING. Intolerable.","I went to La Boina Roja Steak House for a late dinner. They seated us promptly and were attentive, taking our orders and serving our food in a timely manner.However, the food was average. I had the bandeja campesina, which came with chicharron, steak, and chorizo as well as an egg, avocado, rice, and beans. The chicharron was a bit too fried for me. It was extremely crispy, requiring lots of chewing. The steak was overcooked, and dry for my liking. That being said, the food still tasted good.Overall, La Boina is a casual restaurant in Jackson Heights -- not upscale, but not a hole-in-the-wall.","I just finished eating in this restaurant, the food is terrible, tasteless, no salt or pepper sauce","Good food, that hasn't changed. Brought a friend who lives in city for a 'queens' restaurant. He was impressed, and ate everything (big steak).They can grill really well, and food quality is great. Had the sangria which was good.Only thing I was surprised with was the mandatory tip that they added, and we were just two people. I usually like to decide how much service should be rewarded, it not a given.Most importantly, my friend and I had a great meal.",If you're in the mood for Colombian food then you should give this place a shot. Portions are very decent. The food is savory and condiments help with giving it the extra seasoning it needs without being too salty. Fried beans are made fresh and not canned. These were delicious!! I'll be back to try their other dishes.,"This spot is not just your average Colombian restaurant, right next door they also own a butcher shop with all the popular Latin condiments and other Colombian yummies.While this wasn't our first trip to this spot, it's definitely one of the nice places were the taste is consistent. It's not the biggest place and when you visit, you will more than likely have to wait to be seated though they do take reservations as we found out. It's a cozy place and to be kind, it might feel a bit cramped to some.The food....  I started with ""Tostones de Coco"",th.is was basically tostenes (fried plantains) with a seafood garlic sauce consisting of shrimp, calamari, scallops and imitation crabmeat in creamy translucent garlic sauce. This is one of my favorites whenever I come here, it is so damn tasty. The idea is to dip the tostones into the sauce creating a incredibly delicious combination.I also ordered the ""Parrillada A La Boina"" which was a grilled meat platter consisting of shell steak, skirt steak, sliced beef short ribs, chorizo (Colombian sausage) and morcilla (blood sausage). The sides that's included was a simple salad, rice and beans and fried cassava.To drink I had Sangria, which may I add was surprisingly great.Everything we had was great, the meats were fresh and well seasoned, the fried cassava was really fresh. I really enjoyed the food at this spot and I intend on returning.The only issues I had was as I mentioned above was the seating and how cramped some people might feel, though it's not a reason not to try this place. The other is if you're driving parking will be an issue as 37th Ave in Jackson Heights is a shopping area.",La Boina Roja Steak House
403,Note: 3 1/2 starsThe prices here are much much much better than Benihana. You get the same experience and the same food. I would give Benihana a slight edge in taste and but you get a bit more food here. No wait time and the staff is very nice. I would come back here again.,What could have been a fun experience was ruined by rude staff members. She was making some very rude comments about my fiancée. The other staff members didn't do anything. So we decided to let them know what happened and leave. No sorry or any apologies of any kind. Be warned they are rude and can't speak English very well. I agree with another review that the restaurant smells like gas.  Also we noticed that they do not clean the cooking table very well. You could see bits of burned food on it.,"Delivery was prompt but the food was disappointing.Shumai tasted very generic, and spring rolls, like mediocre Chinese egg rolls. (The menu describes them as ""Spicy tuna, crab, soft shell crab, avocado, shrimp tempura wrapped with rice paper with eel and spicy mayo sauce."" This was so different that that must be a typo.)The sushi was fine but nothing special.","My husband is/was a hibachi virgin. He was on his way home from work and I suggested he pop his hibachi cherry and give it a try. It did not disappoint by any means. Let's put it this way, he's ready to go back and make this one of our go to's in Forest Hills. I grew up going to Hibachi. Benihana was kind of mainstay in South Florida for birthdays when you're a kid. Maybe it was an affluent Jewish thing, but we always went on the occasion, and it was so much fun, especially if you get a chef who's in the right mood and preforms for the dining audience at his table.On this night at Shogun, our chef was on fire (literally and figuratively). He played off our energy and did all the fun tricks that hibachi chef's like to do, such a flip the shrimp off the grill and into a guest's mouth (or at least try.) Lol. It was just the two of us seated at a table for 8 with others we did not know, which is half the fun of going to a hibachi restaurant. The service and the food were great. (And, FYI, we actually went to Benihana in Manhattan the other night for my birthday and to relive a moment of my childhood, and Shogun is as good, if not better than the one-time leader of this art.)I had the shrimp and lobster and Jayson had the Filet Mignon and shrimp.The meat literally melted in your mouth. I was a little nervous about it because I had dental work and needed soft foods that night, so I opted not to eat it. But Jayson gave me a bite of his steak and I was in heaven. It was perfectly cooked, and very tender. My shrimp and lobster were excellent. The food is big proportions. We ended up taking some home, which became a midnight treat. It was even good as leftovers and we don't normally eat leftovers. For his first hibachi experience, this was an excellent choice. And, it's reasonably priced that we'll be coming back on a regular basis.",This was my first time to a hibachi .And it didn't disappoint at all ..this particular restaurant was awesome. Me and my wife was there celebrating Valentine's day. And it was all I expected it to be.The ambiance was great we were at a really good table with another couple who was celebrating Valentine's day also.the chef came to the table and began his hibachi classic fire starter .I had never seen this before it was amazing. He had three chicken and broccoli along with lamb and lobsters..the eggs and and fried rice and he set the rice a blaze .and made it into a heart shape. The food and the ambiance was wonderful. I could not have ask for a better experience on Valentine's day at a hibachi. The place was nice a clean also ..that's always a  plus. The service and staff was great .and the rest rooms were very decent. So for my first hibachi experience it was a real good one from my chicken breast cutlet chopped up with the fried rice and vegetables to the atmosphere I give this place a  5/5 stars. And I will definitely go back there in the future.,Very nice family oriented restaurant. The food was delicious. And the service was good. I like the hole hibachi experience. With the meal being  prepared in front of you. Awesome experience  .I would definitely recommend it,Shogun Hibachi
404,I was really craving some Thai food and decided to order from here via Postmates. The reviews looked great so I was expecting it to be amazing. Sad to report that my expectations were not met. The Pad See Ew and spring rolls were terrible. I'm so disappointed. The taste was flat and just not good. Completely ruined my appetite.,"I'm definitely surprised to see so many glowing reviews, my experience ordering delivery with UThai was far from great. The roti canai was a flat, greasy, oily mess. The bread had become almost gelatinous with grease, completely inedible. The curry was also a stingy portion, there was far more oily bread than there was liquid to soak it up. The spring rolls had a similar problem, even the dipping sauce they came with. The flavor profile of the pad kee mao was off and also had textural problems. There wasn't a redeeming item on the entire order :/",Average foods on paper plates. I went there 40 minutes before closing. Specific noodles were ran out and fewer vegetables than I saw on photos.,"The best drunken noodles with vegetables, I ever had!!! It was the perfect blend of spices and portion was good to fill me up for $10.84. This is a great place for take out I don't recommend dine in as there's not much of a space beside two tables to sit and eat. Not a fancy place at all it's like any take out place. They do delivery as well Incase you are not willing to make the trip. I placed the order on the phone and the lady who answered was polite. Ugh I hate the fact parking is a hassle in this neighborhood even though I went around 10pm (literally like when they closed down) to pick up my food but no luck with a parking spot. I highly recommend placing an order on the phone and let them know when to get it ready for pick up. I am officially hooked on these drunken noodles I'll be back for some more!!!!****Cash Only****","I usually order food from UThai since their delivery is in my area. I never get charged from delivery fee. This time I order the same dishes as usual, I got charged $5 sth without being informed. Then, I called the restaurant and asked. They told me they forgot to call and let me know. My issue was not about money, it's about if the policy was changed you should let the customers know before hand. Fyi my food was $12.50 as following as the rules of UThai minimum delivery.",My first time ordering from here. I found it on Seamless and I've been trying a few of the Thai places close by and this one was the best so far. I haven't been to or seen the actual restaurant but I'll do a walk by or drive by soon. I usually get the basics the first time at a Thai place to test the waters. This place definitely passed the test. The Pad Thai and Thai Fried Rice were delicious and authentic as well. I'm definitely a fan.,UThai
405,"Well I had probably the worst dining experience in the past 10 years at this place (not exaggerating).I come in with my girlfriend and daughter to have a night out. We get seated. 10 minutes later and still no menus. I have to ask for it. No biggie.I decide to go wash my hands. I open the bathroom door and there is a clogged toiled filled to the brim with diarrhea. I can't even was my hands the smell was so strong. My girlfriend said there was no soap in the ladies room either. Hand sanitizer for the win. I order a pitcher of sangria, chicken soup, a Chivito D'oro, and an orange juice. I specifically ordered the  Chivito D'oro for the matambre.Sangria comes, soup comes, and an empty cup for the orange juice. The waitress says she'll bring the OJ out soon.10 minutes later, nothing. I have to remind her. Then she brings one that was spoiled. Dark orange juice and a lot of juice that settled on the bottom. Expiration date said Dec 2019 but frankly this tasted like it was exposed to heat.Now I'm getting annoyed.The main entree comes and as I start eating, I realize the matambre isn't there. I call another waitress over and asked her if what I received was the Chivito D'oro. She said no. She told me that my waitress said I ordered the combo 2. She even repeated my order back and still screwed it up. Now I'm pissed and lost my appetite. You forget to give us the menu. The forget the OJ. Then serve me spoiled orange juice, then mess up my order and then tell me I ordered the wrong thing.The manager was conveniently out for the day and not responding to calls.I can't tell if the food was any good because SO MANY THINGS WENT WRONG.",Very disappointing. They have two of the same name for their parilla for 2. If you pick the wrong one you get a grill full of fatty meats. The food was cold and service slow. If you want to go to place that's crowded and loud then go there.We gave our leftovers to a homeless person.,Horrible service! We sat for 15 minutes before they brought us a menu. When I said I wanted to order he said you have to wait for the waitress.  I waited an additional 10 minutes for her to come to the table.,"OMG !! So much meat, my first time there but the place been around a long long time is in the heart of Jackson Heights, Queens Tons of Spanish restaurants and shops Place was nice & clean, food was a lot , service was Excellent, I would definitely go back for more meats","Great Meats, Great Grill, & Consistent. Wish they would work on their service a little better.Come here if you are looking to just get your stomach encroached with cow. They have amazing beef short ribs & skirt steaks. They throw down on the grill and their portions are more than kind. Marinated and juicy!Get here a little before rush hour if you want to avoid the line. If you have a party of 4 get their party grill it wont let you and your eaters down!","I really wish I could give this place 5 stars because of their great service. However, the food was just not up to par. I ordered the grilled fish with rice and beans and the fish was very salty. Furthermore, the beans had bacon in it (which I do not eat) and it was not told to me until I noticed myself-- unfortunately after already eating some. The waitress was really nice about it and offered to switch the side for something else but that was already 2 strikes for me. The last one was my maracuya drink. It was very tarty and slushee, not a juice consistency like I was expecting. Unfortunately not the experience I was hoping for. However I did see other people enjoying their meals and my friend who ordered steak and mashed potatoes enjoyed his so perhaps I would have had better luck if I ordered meat.",Chivito De Oro
406,"I would have e given 4 stars but the dishes were all a bit salty. There's not alot of Vietnamese restaurants in the LIC area,  so options are limited. As far as Vietnamese restaurants I rate them OK.","I would have e given 4 stars but the dishes were all a bit salty. There's not alot of Vietnamese restaurants in the LIC area,  so options are limited. As far as Vietnamese restaurants I rate them OK.","I live in the neighborhood and this is one of my go to spots. Ive tried several items on the menu and have found my favorites to be the minced pork soup, tilapia noodle salad, and bo luc lac. I've dined in once which was a nice enough experience for a casual meal, but usually pick up or get delivery.","VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY ALERT  Fell in love with this place instantly. From the interior decorations, to the awesome staff and last but not least, the food :)This is hands down the best vegetarian banh Mi  I've had in the tri-state. I am absolutely in love with the quality and hard work they put into making the Banh Mi tofu.  It is extremely affordable for the high quality of food they serve. After my first bite, I knew I will be coming back. If you're coming from the city or brooklyn, it's a nice area with a lot of areas near by  such as cute bars,  other restaurants, the pepsi co. park, cute bakeries. Worth the trip  from anywhere","Hoisin duck wrap (appetizer; $9) was really goodGrilled pork bahn mi tasted great but was a little expensive ($11). The pork was well marinated and cut thinly, so it had tons of flavor.The grilled pork vermicelli ($13) was also good - the same pork from the grilled bahn mi was marinated which made the dish tasty.The clay pot Vietnamese beef stew ($15) was NOT good. There was hardly any sauce so the majority of the dish lacked flavor, but what made it inedible was beef was very, very dry...dry tasteless beef is not great. The side of vegetables (steamed yu choy w sauce) was actually really tasty. If I'm in LIC again, I may come back to order the bahn mi for takeout. The restaurant was also very very hot inside since there was no ac (in July!)","Cyclo (#1), the rickshaw themed Vietnamese establishment has slowly become the go-to option in LIC for simply being only the game in town. A smart move on the part of the Thai folks who run the joint, considering the scarcity of Vietnamese cuisine and the demand for something remotely close to it. I tend to call it Vietnamese with a Thai twist (#2), which it most certainly is.The space is nicely decorated and modern enough to be the exact opposite of a hole in the wall. The interior is sun kissed with natural lighting from all angles and the contemporary decor makes this a nice option for both lunch and dinner for small groups. I personally think daytime is the best time to be here.I've come here with some Viet friends and have had some semi-embarrassing encounters with the staff where they actually couldn't understand us when we ordered dishes right off the menu (#3). Turns out no one had ever pointed out how certain dishes (i.e. com ga nuong, bo luc lac) were pronounced. Yikes.The food is nothing to get hyped about, which is tough because I've tried a majority of the menu over the years. The presentation for most dishes and sandwiches are lovely and certainly the most photo worthy during daylight. I haven't given the pho much thought after an initial try and I tend to avoid most of the noodle dishes as well as their banh mi. The curries and salads feel more Thai than they do Viet, but I imagine many folks wouldn't know the difference.Then there are the prices, which are pretty steep. $13 banh mi? $19 super pho? $14 fried rice? $12-15 claypot bowls? That LIC rent is really something. I guess no one is coming here because they think it's cheap, but I suppose in this hood, this *is* cheap.Ultimately, it's hard to take this place seriously as a prime Vietnamese spot. I know Viet purists might scoff at the food or even the operation of the diligent Thai staff but what it really boils down to is the makeup of the food. Pho broth isn't up to par. I am into the claypot and over-rice dishes, but that's not really enough to make up for the rest of the food. The banh mi is solid but the bread is a bit too hard for the roof of my mouth. Plus, when you misspell it on the menu (aka good ol BAHN MI), the credibility goes right out the window.____________(#1) Or in Vietnamese, ""xich lo.""(#2) In New York, most Viet joints are Chinese or Korean run. There are the few that are Viet Hoa Ky, but mainly cho-lon'ish (Chinese Viet?) (#3) Which in recent years has actually included the Viet names of certain dishes.",Cyclo
407,Do not order on uber eats.....they always cancel and send no notifications...I tired to call but no response,"Hmmmm.......$85 a head but a few people didn't even eat?  I dunno........I didn't even plan on dining out but it was for a coworker so whatever but $85?!.  Did someone order the puffer fish along with a hot air balloon ride? I have no idea why crab legs and shrimp cost so much.  The staff works hard, I give them their due. However the experience is lacking. The place is small and cramped, not my style. They only have one bathroom. Again, not my style.  The prices are crazy.   Food is good, the spicy WAS spicy thank goodness but I didn't like the confusing way they brought food out in these plastic baggies.  Again, not my style. They even brought out plastic gloves like this was Forensic Files. I suppose I should have donned the gloves but dammit I wanted to feel my eats.  Parking was hard and confusing but my ride was able to find a spot. Maybe Ill return but only to find our why our bill was so high.",If your a person who loves food with spice don't order from here . Ordered take out from this restaurant and the food wasn't that well .It lacked and flavor what so ever down to the sauce .,"Soooo much flavor and spice! I came here on a double date on Labor Day and we were surprised to see them open. Walking in at first I felt a bit iffy. The atmosphere is a bit meh the music was mostly hip hop and there's a full bar. We were seated at a table that was freshly covered in what seemed like paper with a plastic coating for when you get messy with your seafood-boil. We ordered two happy hour drinks which were decent and we also ordered what we thought were the happy hour fried oysters for the table which was advertised on a chalkboard. (Will elaborate more on this)We ordered family style 3 combo boils shared amongst the four of us all medium spice level which we all felt was pretty spicy considering that all of us love spicy food.  all All in all the food was great.The only reason I'm shaving a star off is because we left the establishment a bit bitter.The oysters we ordered with our server were infact not the happy hour oysters. The server explained that the happy hour oysters came with fries but we didn't get that one we just got the larger 6 piece standard appetizer. Our server also had asked us if we would like to leave the head on our shrimp and we decided to order one of the boils without the head, he did not tell us upon giving us this option that removing the head is an extra $1.This was all realized once we got the check and explained after we questioned it. It's no big deal it's just that we would have appreciated knowing in advanced. We were a bit annoyed and couldn't get out of there fast enough.","Garlic lovers, this is the best seafood boil you'll come across! I've visited several different seafood boil spots, some nearby are (blazin' cajun + hot n juicy) but I always find myself comparing it to shakin' crab! The chunkiness of the garlic with the spice level and salt are so mouth watering and definitely satisfy my seafood craving! My favorite deal is 1lb shrimp with 1/2lb mussels, I always leave full with half a bag in tow. I add the corn and rice on the side and my favorite flavor is the house shakin' sauce on the hot/spicy level. It's the 2nd to hottest and pretty spicy (nose running, mouth tingling and all that)! My friend got the cilantro lime and she said it was enjoyable but less spicy overall and she prefers the shakin' sauce. The crab was pretty good but not AS fresh as other places. The mussels were also very tasty and they shake the bag well enough so that spices and garlic coat everything including going inside the mussel shell. My friends have told me that the potatoes and sausage additions are not worth it because they don't give enough, so that's something to consider. Their portions are better than other places I've visited. Service can be a little better but I don't mind, they are busy and trying to juggle a lot at once. The bathroom was also clean and they gave use the proper utensils to have a delicious meal. Long story short, if you prefer a chunky sauce and love shrimp.. No more searching, this is the ONE.","Pretty much the same concept as Joe's crab shack, only it's in flushing chinatown and very low key. We ordered blue crabs, lots of shrimps and clams along with garice noodles, garlic mac and cheese and fries. I tried the medium spicy sauce which I thought was still really spicy. My friend that had ordered spicy one basically cried through the whole meal, so if you can't take spicy, get medium like me and it's still a bit spicy.Blue crabs were really tiny with bascially no meat in them.. shrimps and clams were also pretty small but they were tasty. Garlice noodles were just okay. But the garlic mac and cheese?! I've never tried garlic mac and cheese but this was one of the best mac and cheese I've ever tried! It was soOOoo good and went really well with our meal. You don't get to eat louisiana style seafood every day so I think it's worth the experience and the staff here are very accomodating.",Shaking Crab
408,"A special trip was made to Flushing for this highly rated joint.  It was worth experiencing the sucking of the abundance of juicy and tasty broth inside their ""Xiao Long Bao"",  thicker was the skin in holding the hot liquid.  Disappointing was the rest.Packed the front room was on this Thursday night, so we were led to the side room. Nauseous I was immediately of the stench of uncleanliness and worse when seated in front of a bin of dirty rags.Tasting after changing tables, good were the ""XLB""; doughy ""pan fried pork buns"";  garlicky, stale tasting ""cucumber & garlic""; and, ok was their ""Rice Cake with Pork & Preserved Mustard"".While reviewing this, I am here to say that it is wrong of believers expecting to receive bad service at all Chinese restaurants, for its simply not true.  Unpleasant and rude was our server in all respects that evening.  I'd left if I wasn't a guest.  cheers!","So there was a queue once we arrived at the restaurant. Got my name on the list and the lady said 15 minutes. After 20 minutes passed, I went in to check where we're at in terms of waiting for a table for three of us. The lady said another 5-10 minutes. Ok so we waited about 10 minutes. Still no call. I went in again, she said, 5 more minutes, they are cleaning our table. Oh good Lord! At this point I was hungry on the verge of hangry. I kept my composure and go along with the flow. We got sat before this other customers who got sat like a minute after us, but for some reasons, she took in their orders before us! And of course their foods came out before us! Dafuq?!Anywho, the food wasn't all that great to bribe about. Would not return.","Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao It was a rainy Sunday! If you arrive before 1pm and it's raining you're in luck! A table for four no wait. Little did i know that when I came back with a party of four and we waited 15 mins for our table. Saw that there were over 3000 reviews on yelp and I knew I had to try this place out. I had this back when I was in Shanghai and there was also a wait. So we ended up ordering takeout and ate it at the hotel. The pork steam dumplings in shanghai were small though. Alright back to this restaurant in NYC. All the items on the menu seem more breakfast type of food. What we ordered: Salted Soy Bean Curd: ($2.75) this tasted okay. Seem like they just threw it soy sauce on top of the soy bean curd. Scallion Pancake:($3.95) crunchy on the outside. Pan Fried Pork Buns: ($6.95) (6 pieces) order came out cold. Guess it's been sitting there for quite some time. Maybe we shouldn't have order this since we order dumplings. Rice cake with shredded pork and preserved mustard: ($7.95): basically what it states. Okay dish no wow factor to it. Shanghai Panfried Udon: ( $7.50) looked more like udon with beef and shanghai bak Choi. I like the Chinese style better with seafood. Steamed pork buns: ($6.50) not enough meat filling. Also we order crab too but when our order arrived, they messed up the order and gave us 2 pork dumplings instead of 1 pork and 1 crab. Not happy about that as they won't do an exchange for us.I don't know what the rave is about this restaurant but there are better soup dumpling restaurants out there. Service was mediocre. Food was okay. I had high expectations due to the amount of reviews but sadly disappointed.","Feel good good. Affordable and delicious. Food is served fresh and quickly! CASH ONLY!Soup Dumplings, udon noddles and the scallion pancakes are my norms! Check it out.","My family, boyfriend, and I had lunch here in Aug 2018, and absolutely loved it! The service was like most Chinese restaurants - inattentive and curt - but we came here for the food. Dumplings: We ordered pork XLB, crab XLB, and Shanghai shiu mai. The XLB here are very soupy, and the soup itself is very meaty and flavorful. The pork in the pork XLB has a strong taste of ginger. The crab XLB has a strong crab flavor (almost suspiciously strong - hope it's from actual crab and not crab flavoring.) Chilled side dishes: chilled tripe was delicious and rich in spices. Only critique would be the numbing spice needs to be a lot stronger. Garlic cucumber was also great. We also ordered the beef wrapped in scallion pancake, Shanghai udon, spicy beef noodle soup, and soy milk. Everything was delicious and inexpensive. Definitely will be returning next time we visit NYC!","Cash only! But worth the hassle..Came here couple times. Always full and lines but got seated quick. Great to order: - stir fry noodle- scallion pancake with or without beef- fried bun with chives and egg- fry dough- red bean pastry- Xiao long baoExcept the pastry, they all come with grease, but hey YOLO!",Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao
409,"This is not authentic Indian food but a highly westernized, bland version of the cuisine. Tried the korma and samosas and will not be coming again.","MAJOR KEY ALERT!!!I'm shook.

Couldn't believe it. You get an appetizer, entree and free naan for checking in with that! I had the chicken korma which was lightly sweet but still creamy and savory, I asked for spicy and the waitress told me it wouldn't be very spicy but still took my request.

410,Took a date here a couple weeks ago and we ended up at my place. That's all I have to say.Food was good too.,This is the first and last time we come here on a weekend.  Waited over 40 minutes for valet parking that never showed up.  Apparently there was only one attendant and he disappeared.  Unreal.,"So overpriced for horrible tasting paella. I liked the interior and extensive wine list , macaroni was ok but didn't justify the $20 price tag... this is queens... not soho. The paella was so bad we couldn't finish more than a few bites and it left a horrible aftertaste . $36 for rotting frozen seafood in a bed of wet odd tasting rice. Will not be back again . There are def better tapas options in the area",The food was excellent. Lovely place to enjoy having a conversation and good food. The mushroom bruschetta was to die for. As was the steak tartare.   Add a nice glass of Merlot and it was perfect.  The only negative thing I have to say is I came out to get my car (a two week old car at that) and the valet was hanging out in it blasting music and my seat position was changed.    Since parking on Bell Blvd is so bad - the fact that you can't trust your car to the valet is a big thing with me - I probably will not go back. Too bad since everything else was great,"Came here the Sunday before LDW, and I was surprised it was fairly empty. Walking in, I loved the ambiance and set up. It's a nice, loungey, set up with lots of space - it's a long restaurant with a fairly large bar. Our server was really nice and patient with my indecisiveness. We order a Charcuterie board with: Chorizo, Jamon Iberico, Salami, Pierre Robert cheese and still had one more option (5 things were $24 I think so that was a good deal)... our server recommended the blue cheese since it was a mild one and I'm SO happy we got it. It paired really well with the mustard, pickles, truffle honey + fig jam. I was in barcelona in January and what we had tasted/looked/felt like prosciutto so I wonder if it was Jamon iberico, but still good nonetheless. We actually enjoyed this so much that we would've ordered this again if we didn't already pre-order a paella. We got the octopus as well, and they were very generous with the portions (which is normally an issue at most places in general). I personally wished it was more charred and salty - I don't really remember much about this dish and that's nor really a great sign for me since my life revolves around food. Bone marrow was plentiful: big pieces with bread and sweet sautéed onions. I wasn't a fan of this, it was more oily than I would've liked and it was sweeter than I would've liked. I wish it was more salty than sweet.We got cavatelli with a veal ragu sauce - I didn't want this, but my sister did. It was a rich dish but not my favorite...decent and filling which was cool but wish it had more flavor. We got the patatas bravas, but they were massive potato wedges - crispy but not as flavored as I would've liked and it just wasn't good lol We were full from all the taste testing and forgot we ordered the paella: it was good but also bland. We also had a pitcher of sangria which maybe had 4-5 glasses of sangria which was yummy. I'd probably come back for the charcuterie and either try something else or just chill there with a dish or two that I like and some sangria.",When I want to have a nice dinner date with the wife usually Fino comes up to mind in our list of choices.

411,"It's a really long wait here on a Friday night.  Not really that busy, I've been in restaurants that are busier.  Problem is that they seem to be understaffed.  One waitress for the whole place.  It seems like a normal Friday here.  I brought my kids and we've been waiting almost an hour here for the entree.  My son is starving to death.  I've been here before and the food is decent, but I can tell you that the service is unacceptable, only because there's only one girl.  Asked for a wine list and didn't get it until after like 15-20 minutes.  THEN we were able to order our food.  And the food takes forever.  My son and I ordered a steak and a salad for my daughter.  We got the appetizers and gobbled it up.  But still sitting here after all this time waiting for our food.  I don't care if this is the best food on earth.  I still give one star because of the wait.  I got a coke instead of a wine list.","WARNING. Do NOT book any party with this place or the manager. The manager does not honor the contract and adds additional charges without notifying the customer. She was nasty and rude and blames the customer for her own mistake.We made a contract for a party with the manager and was guarantee buffet style food, replenishment, and take home leftovers. She agreed to not charge children that will share a plate with their parents. Unfortunately that was a lie. On the day of the party, the manager charge us for the children she agreed to not charge. She said the children had their own plate and that she had to refill the buffet food because they ate. When I brought up the original agreement, she began yelling and accusing us of cheating her. Then she said she had to also charge us because we took leftovers. If she told me earlier that she had to charge us for refills and take out then I would have obliged. But tacking on the charge last minute and being nasty about it is not customer friendly. Whatever happened to customer first. I disapprove of the manager behavior and will not recommend or return. I hope the manager learns that pinching for pennies over customer service is poor for business.We had a party at 7pm and the food was not ready until 8pm. They were understaffed. One server and one waiter for a large party. Dishonest and rude manager. I have a feeling some of these reviews are fakes. Book at your own discretion.",Only decent bar / restaurant around this area but I wouldn't order this dish shrimp scallops lobster in saffron cream sauce it's not great.,"We were here for a private party.  The staff here was great, food was great! The men had their own area they can watch the games without bothering us!  Love the atmosphere here! Will be back again for sure!","Great food, like super great, nice bartenders. Heavy pours, lot of TV's. NFL Sunday can get super crowded and the tv management can be frustrating-they have the ticket but Giants will be on six TV's next to each other. Other than the tv mismanagement still a cool place to catch games.Their food specials aren't so great and a bit priced, but the quality is high. Also during busy times the wait for the food can be a while and they have confused my order a couple times. Ex: ordered chili nachos (on the menu) and I got a bowl of chili with a side of chips.","On Friday May 24th, I had my daughter's Confirmation at Connolly's Corner. Bridget was my memory maker. She was on top of everything from start to finish & made the celebration a memorable one. She is extremely professional, so sweet & personalable.Simply the best person for her line of work, extremely swet & easy going. I'm grateful that she made sure that any left over food & cake was ready & packed to go at the end of the night. The bakery the restaurant uses made a delicious strawberry short cake, that was moist & the best part is that it was NOT overly sweet!The food was yummy & the vegetables were nicely cut uniformly. The nachos were so yummy, The chicken tenders were nice & crunchy & the french fries delicious (lol.. Could've eaten the whole plate of the french fries myself).Simply had a wonderful & delightful experience at Connolly's Corner all thanks to Bridget!!!!

There's no onion in there unless it's mashed in with the dough. lol when you bite into it, it looks like bread lol. No onions. They're not bad but if you're expecting a traditional onion ring you won't get that. The pita and the falafel were a little hard. You can't order onion rings on seamless even tho they have them, that's what made us call. There was also no delivery they said the wait time was an hour and a half before anyone could come to us.

UNTIL today I order delivery and all I got were some mushy falafel patties that tasted  frozen and tasteless...literally inedible. I was really looking forward to some fresh falafels... So disappointed. Also for delivery, the sauce should not have been put on the rice. It was so soggy by the time it got here. Sauce on the side would have been a much better choice. Unlikely I will ever eat here again.. So disappointed...","Oh how I love halal food!! This is such an awesome idea of taking the love of halal food and putting it into a store front. Right by my job, my foodie partner and I was in the mood for some good halal food so why not try it out!Right in front of the store they have plenty of street parking which is great! Automatically the menu captures your attention cause not only do they sell halal food they also offer, chicken wings, burgers as well as different types of sandwiches! ((Mind blown)).. I had ordered the lamb over salad with fries. They allowed me to substitute the rice for it to be all salad which was awesome! The food itself is delicious!! The Lamb is very tender and cooked to perfection I love the salad itself it had a mixture of peppers, purple onions, cucumbers, and tomatoes. The fries that come with your platter is so yummy they are spicy fries or season fries some people may call it, which are my favorite style fries!! If you stay to eat they have big squirt bottles of there spicy sauce as well as there white sauce! I so love that idea! It allowed me to put even More of there delicious white sauce on the salad as well as the fries!! This is a must try place! Whether if your ordering through grub hub. Or taking it on the go!","Oh my god this place is crack. Everything about this place is delicious, the white sauce is made so good, the burgers are mouthwatering and the chicken over rice tastes so authenticity NYC you'd think you were at a street cart except it tastes better!Just everything tastes so good i just want to keep going back and eating.","This was such a great find! Loved the friendliness of the place as well as how delicious the food tasted  Their white sauce also on point!The place is clean and spacious which is plus if you want to dine in.I got the Combo Gyro Platter which comes with chicken & lamb gyro meat with pita bread, French fries & salad. They give a generous amount of meat which is great but i only got 4 pieces of Naan. Maybe a few more would have been nice but nonetheless everything tasted amazing!",Halal Munchies
413,"A place where u can go after work and chill out, their wings are deliciousssss  they're open late too A+ for me.","I am so upset and embarrassed at the way my friends and I were treated on my birthday this past Friday (5/10) at the Mad Donkey that I am considering writing a formal complaint. Mainly because I have been patronizing this place for over five years. I and friends have introduced this place and their fish bowls to numerous people and were so turned off by my most recent visit that I will never go back. My friends and I arrived around 1 am after grabbing some beers atSinglecut Brewery. Upon entering I immediately went to the bathroom, I was in there for no less than five minutes. However, when I came out the tall bartender who is also supposedly the owner approached my friends and me at the bar and with a nasty tone and lack of pleasantness told us ""You need to buy a drink at the bar or else leave"". I literally just walked up, one of my friends doesn't drink and one of my friends DID order a drink. So his hostility at the jump was a HUGE turn-off. At that point, I just wanted to leave because I get that your bar was practically EMPTY but customer service would have gone a long way as I was about to buy a round for my friends that were drinking. I tried talking to the bouncer to express my frustration and discontent with the service and was met with a patronizing ""did we refuse service to you?"" I am not stupid and have worked in the restaurant business, basically, you wanted to act as if you all did your part when really you failed and prejudged my friends and I.  That was the most disheartening part of this experience the prejudgment that my friends and I weren't going to spend money when we have so MANY times in the past. I hope the owner reads this and remembers that people with money to burn don't always look like what you THINK they should look like.",The seediest crowd in Astoria. Like the first 10 minutes of a Law & Order episode. Okay for dive bar drinks or first dates you want to hide from the world. Upside is you can throw peanut shells on the ground so that's something.,"GREAT FOOD. GREAT DRINKS. GREAT STAFF. I live 1,850 miles south of this place in Texas and I felt like I never left when I walked into this place.  I can honestly say this was the best bar and grill I visited while I was in town. Being from Texas, I already stuck out like a sore thumb, but Karen and of course Tommy D made my fiance and I feel right at home. We literally walked in at 7pm and left close to 2am not because we were drinking all night, but because we were talking to everybody.  FOOD:ORDER THE WINGS with Donkey Sauce.  I also ordered the jackass burger. Both of these items were just 2 of the items off there great menu. Feeling brave? Try the Donkey Mess. Drinks:I'm a whiskey guy and usually drink Jameson, but Tommy recommended another Irish Whiskey called Tullamore Dew. I haven't touched Jameson since. They have all sorts of drinks to choose from, but I would recommend the Tully if you haven't ever had it. I went to Manhattan,  Coney Island,  Brooklyn and the Bronx to eat and have a few drinks during my visit, but none of those places held a candle to this place.  If you're looking for a place to hangout,  watch the game,  have some great food, great drinks, and to feel like family.....this is the spot to go to. Go in and tell Tommy that Texas sent you. Tommy D we will be back up there not for just sights of the city, but to come see you, Karen and the rest of y'all there.Brothers for life","We were in town for the night and asked the hotel where to go for a couple of drinks. They sent us to the Mad Donkey. We walked in to karaoke and were a little unsure of how long we'd stay.....Then we met Tommy, the owner. He immediately put us at ease with humour and made us feel like regulars. People walked in and out all night, when people knew them they shouted their name, when they didn't they were cleared a space right at the bar. The Mad Donkey is exactly how I imagined a typical NY neighbourhood bar to be. Friendly, chill and low key. There's bras and bar taps on the ceiling and by doing a donkey challenge you can get your Polaroid up on the wall. I Highly recommend the Mad Donkey to anyone who wants to see NY in it's true form.Thank you Tommy for an awesome night! - The Canadians","I'm not in Queens often... but if I'm ever even remotely near this bar again I'll be there in a heartbeat.It's got the charm of a bar that's been open since post-prohibition although it's apparently only been open since 2010! Cheap drinks, not cramped, and just a general good vibe.The owner/bartender, Tommy, was hilarious, crass (which i think is great), and so attentive.It was a Wednesday and there was karaoke, which is always a ball.Don't be afraid to throw the peanut shells on the floor (even though my most basic instinct told me I shouldn't)",Mad Donkey Beer Bar & Grill
414,"Placed two orders for delivery in the past two weeks. Both cancelled. The first one possibly because of holiday and was cancelled quickly. The second one was cancelled after it was late for delivery, after we were waiting for almost an hour. Highly unlikely that we'll try ordering again. In the past the food was good.",They are the worst. I placed an order waited 2 hours just so they can ignore my calls then at very last minute before they close they cancel my order ??? With no explanation no call back. These people are the worst and extremely disrespectful.,"Very close to home, very well decorated. It has that urban look. Their music playlist is pretty much hip hop and that's it. I hear others singing a long while they wait for their food. You can catch yourself singing a whole entire mixtape for your food. I waited about 40 mins for a medium well burger one time. Don't get me wrong, the food is great! I've tried their philly cheese steak Mac, bacon cheese burger with waffle fries, milkshakes, all bomb. But if you got no where to be, don't mind building up that hunger, and have someone interesting to talk to by all means. Also management I don't know if it's the time of the week that I come here but sometimes you guys run out of things? I came here just for dessert once and I asked for something on the menu that y'all didn't even have. I asked for another and the waitress stated that it wasn't in stock either. I don't understand lol I ended up eating the guava cheesecake that tasted kinda old to me.","Came here on a weekday morning. Metered parking right in front as well as street parking around the residential areas. I had the black & white milkshake. Loaded tater tots, buttermilk fried chicken sandwich, grilled chicken mac & cheese, and 8 piece buffalo wild wings (lemon pepper & mango habernero. The portions were big and definitely shareable. Firstly, when we came in, we were greeted immediately and seated. We thought we would be the first ones since we got there 10 minutes into opening, but there was already another family feasting. The high yelp review/ratings really reflect on the service/food/attention serviced here. The server/host was very accommodating and gave any details (regarding food/price/portions) that a first timer wouldn't know which was greatly appreciated. Food/Drinks were prepared very deliciously and I was rather surprised at the presentation because it was a diner. The food came quickly and was hot and ready to eat.Interior was very clean and had a lot of NYC vibes to it which was also really cool. Played a lot of spanish music, but very subtly in the BG.","I wanted to like this place more because my cousin raved about it so much and I'm not saying that it was a bad place. And the fact the food that I did eat was good.We ordered 2 orders of regular mac & cheese as an appetizer and oh my, it was really good.  Hot & bubbly and cheesy just the way I like it.  They have many different types of mac and cheese but for me I prefer regular mac & cheese. This place delivered on that.  & for that they get an extra star! I ordered a buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and what I didn't realize was that it said served with coleslaw. I didn't realize that the coleslaw would actually be on the sandwich and I think that's where I went wrong. So maybe it's my fault. However the chicken sandwiche was a bit too salty for my liking. I got tater tots with my order and the tater tots or were very hot &crisp and tasted really good. my cousin got a steak sandwich and my other cousin got French toast. She did order chocolate chip French toast and when the order arrived it was regular French toast she didn't say anything and she just kept the French toast she was given. I didn't taste some french toast but she said it was good. I noticed the guy was making some shakes and it seems that this place is known for their shakes but what I did notice was that they were using a frosting to frost a glass. And that's the thing that I don't like about places that make those signature shakes, is that they do use frosting just to make it look nice and I'm just not a fan of that.",JULIE MAKES THE BEST MIMOSAS!!! This diner has really great food! Staff is super friendly! And the mimosas from Julie are the greatest!  Thank me later!!!,Corona Diner
415,I came here recently to purchase some meats for New Years. I bought 3 huge piece of meat (Vacio) for $70. Worth every penny. They have a wide selection and also have a dining area. Will be back soon.,"Argentinian beef cuisine = El Gauchito. This small butcher shop / restaurant is a GEM! If you don't like meat, no worries they have wonderful options for you. It's a shame that it takes an hour to drive from Brooklyn but it is worth every mile. Go hungry!","Ordered: Skirt steak cooked to medium.Flavor: 65/100Freshness: 100/100Value: 30/100The steak's temperature came out perfect at medium. The flavor is above average but NOT WORTH the $33.00 they charge and that's take out price. A fair price would be $23-$25 as the steak is also rather SMALL, most steak eaters will remain hungry.","I've been on a search for a really good skirt steak ever since our favorite steakhouse closed down. Found this place online via reviews and decided to give them a try. I didn't actually visit the restaurant so this review is really only for the food. Ordered from there twice so far via Door Dash and both times everything was good. Food was packaged nicely so no spills and the delivery was quick so food was still hot which of course is great. The food was delicious. So far tried the pork chops, skirt steak, and the shrimp and rice. Everything was cooked perfect and tasted great. Also tried the fried provolone from the apps and that was really good as well. We'll have to try out eating there soon as well.","This is truly a hidden gem in Queens. I am fairly confident that if more people knew about this place, I wouldn't be able to enjoy my Mid afternoon lunches with only an intimate group of people.I have been coming to this location for many years, and for those of you that know the diverse culinary landscape of queens, you also know that only the best survive. And not only have they survived, they've expanded with another location in fresh Meadows!Now let's talk about the food. The meat here is second to none. It is grass fed and cooked to your taste, and it is delicious. There is also offal, of which mollejas(sweet breads) are my absolute fave! They are grilled to  perfection and have a slight char on the outside, and a creamy delicious center(enjoy with lemon). They also carry Mondongo(tripe soup) which is worth ordering. The house sangria is tasty and packs a punch! Make sure you leave room for some churros con chocolate for dessert!","IT'S NOT THAT BAD.SERVICE: average, our waiter did tried to provide us good with customer experience, B for effort. Our food runner though, very toxic presence, as if he was bothered to do his job. But maybe he was having a bad day, still, leave your personal issues outside of work. We went there to celebrate a birthday, we had a big group. And alter reviewing some comments here on yelp about this place, we felt it was The best choice. I guess those with good comments on service were lucky, the person that I was very pleased with, was our backwaitress (busgirl). She was so friendly and very welcoming, as if she really cared. THANK U SO MUCH for such a friendly approach. When my nephew knocked down a glass of sangria, she was so friendly, and I am sure she hated, I would have too! But she was just very friendly and understanding. DECOR & EVIROMENT: This place looks more like a pizzeria, or a sports bar, music is played on just about perfect volume, which settles well with the ambiance in there. FOOD: I am not crazy about beef, so this might be a bit bias, then again, I have been in places where I had actually enjoyed a medium rare steak very much, which usually I would NEVER  eat at that temperature. But not in this restaurant, flavors are OK, though they need to take a few more second inspecting the temperature of the meats before being served, my brother ordered a platter of all ""welldone."" However few items were cooked as ordered, some where about medium well, part of a liver was cooked and a good piece was raw...and I mean living raw, haha.I had the mondongo which was pretty good. It comes with rice but I was not given any, but I was ok without it, it's a very large casserole.We had Passion fruit juice which was very delicious. Not too sweet.They also serve some VERY DELICIOUS rolls! I am thinking they are home made, I hope they are, they sure tasted fresh.Most of their food is bit salty, maybe thats how its served? or perhaps we are not use to salty food in general. BE ADVISED: For groups, this restaurant falls off tradition, charging 18% of trip instead of 15% Not mad about, though it would be nice to have the option to tip based on service.They DO NOT accept separate payments within the group. Which is understandable, I guess.What I did find a bit unethical was that if you bring your own cake they charge $1.50 PER PERSON! We had a table of 12...that would have been $18 dollars extra!  Imagine a larger group.Would we return? Sayounara!Will we recommend? Just, maybe.",El Gauchito
416,The traditional Argentinian platter had the best assortment of the three mixed grills provided.  The pork chop from the mixta was cooked really well and was quite tender.  The empanada and provolone appetizers were sufficiently tasty but not necessarily amazing.  Service was uneven at times as one wine order came late and a mashed potato side came in lieu of a requested rice side dish.,"Was hoping to try and new spot for date night and was quickly disappointed. Worst money ever spent. The food was mediocre and the service was lacking. The mashed potatoes had zero flavor, they tasted like instant mash made with water and zero spices. The steaks weren't cooked to the correct temperature and despite asking for things on the side everything was on one plate. There was absolutely no AC in this place it was humid and extremely uncomfortable. I ordered a frozen margarita to cool down and instead got a watered down melted slushee. Simply unappetizing.","After many years at its current location, Pampas was on my radar for quite some time, stain on me for not having gone sooner.Upon my initial entry, server 1 looked at me and didnt say anythinnng, he just looked with a creepy malaise. Soo, I kinda skirted any words coming my way and took the first stool at the bar, quickly. But my presence still remained unaddressed, no welcome, no greeting at all -- server 1 kept his head in the reach in bar cooler until I had no choice but to speak up in an effort to obtain a menu.Sitting seemingly high and leaning forward in an effort to rest the forearm in an upright position was for not. The seats definately need backs.A basket if bread was set down next to me and just by visual observance it was easy to determine the fact that it was old, stale and totally inedible, the aluminum wrapped butter packets looked stepped on as two of three were smushed.I ordered a Manhattan and my entree as quickly as possible as I've officially reached the point of no return, good or bad -- I was committed at this point.Being a sucker for a Porterhouse (its not the best cut, but the drippings typically rule and work fabulously with potato and spinach sides if available.) I didn't balk at $48.95 which isn't of issue -- IF, the steak delivers. And its not to say that this cut didn't make the grade, but it was not the proper price for the 7.5 outta 10 piece of meat that didnt carry much weight, and was served to me slightly over cooked in lieu of my very specific instructions. But being a sucker for whole foods - I am not -- and once I tasted the side of Mashed Potatoes I was thinking that it was possible that the potatoes came from a box. Defended to a communication shut down level, server 1 was so miffed, as if I had personally offended him and everything he stood for with my question -- and in an effort to play pout police, I clearly stated my disinterest in mashed potatoes. (Disinterest: translation - avoid a long, drawn out and hopeless engagement) The level of immaturity really surprised me & now I really picked up the pace of my chewing. (Side note: the Chimichurri sauces get a full star on their own delicious merits, fabulous!)Mind you that server 1 recommended the Garlic Mashed over the regular Mashed which tasted nothing like garlic..... I didn't even want the Garlic (?) Mashed Potatoes...  My head was spinning between audio Sinatra, vidoe Pawn Stars and mental server 1 who still couldn't break from Pouty Face Land. I've little doubt this restaurant can really deliver, but this evenings meal was a total disaster.","Not a bad place overall, but, you'll notice that their menu is a little confusing. I always thought that Churrasco is skirt steak, when here they explain that, even though they serve skirt steak, their churrasco is NY strip.The best part about this place is that they give each table their very own chimichuri sauce in regular and spicy. Both Extremely Delicious.The steak is tasty and plentiful. Leaves you wanting more for next time. Very tasty.","Ah, Pampas....what else can I say about how great this restaurant is that hasn't already been said?Fell in love with the grilled salmon all over again.  The chimichurri tomato that accompanies it melts in your mouth...the potatoes served on the side sops up that wonderful lemon-infused sauce the fish is prepared in...heaven on a plate!  Big enough proportion where you feel satiated but not overly-full.Freshly-made sangria was on point, too.","Another wonderful meal at my favourite restaurant!  On a cold night, the restaurant stays nice and cozy thanks to whomever came up with the idea of the double-door in the front (pull, then push to get inside) which causes virtually no drafts.  The restaurant was a bit busy as the evening lengthened, but server never rushed us, and all of the waitstaff were pleasant and personable as usual.Chef is very accommodating---my daughter was able to request just a simple spaghetti cooked in a butter sauce with fresh parmesan cheese on top.  You'd think it'd be bland, right?  Wrong----even *that* tasted like there was some extra love put in.Enjoyed the ""surf & turf"" special, which came with a 10 oz steak cooked to perfection and a skewer of grilled veggies and shrimp...I wish Pampas would bottle and sell that fresh chimichurri sauce, because it's the best I've ever had---A few times I've found myself contemplating going in and asking to buy a container of just that to take home when passing by, but not sure if they'd allow that LOL.  I've discovered in the past that it even tastes great on their grilled salmon entree.Thinking about that grilled salmon now....think it's time to make reservations for a lunch-date with my daughter, soon!  Yum!",Pampas Argentinas
417,If ya'll want some REAL Argentine BBQ. Then this is your place. Nothing fancy just some serious Argentine style cooking. And NO its the same as Brazilian.,"We wanted to eat some meat and what better than an Argentinean place.unfortunately we did not choose the right place.Upon entering this site I first saw a table with many dirty dishes, something very unpleasant.We ordered a minced small meat and this was wrong, the taste was not good, we consume very little.the chimichurri sauce was bad it had too much garlic.the portions badly served.the waitresses do not know how to take the dishes to take them to the table, one of the waitresses scratching her back at the brassiere level.and I do not wash your hands.Fatal dinner on 4 July.","Went for the parillada not the best proteins a lil chewy ,we receive our plate and she realizes we didn't even eat half she was like I thought you guys have ate here before that's why I didn't recommend anything else, first that's why I asked her about the the menu descriptions she said it was enough for 2 it was disgusting !",This place never disappointed me with their food and customer service. Always friendly staffs and make you feel welcome. I always order La Parrillada for 1 person and share for 2 people because they do give you big portion with one side dish for $29.90. Where can you beat with the price and food quality  will definitely come back soon!,"Great Argentine spot! My family and I gathered to eat parrillada and we were not disappointed! It's a smaller place, for  7 people & a baby stroller we managed just fine. I recommend the carne empanada al horno aka beef empanada oven baked as opposed to fried. Argentine empanada are traditionally oven baked so if you want authentic definitely order that way. The milanesa de carne was yummy, tasted just like the way my papi used to make for us as kids.","Great place for carnivores. No nonsense restaurant where grilled meat is the main center of attention and action. No matter how conservative I order, it always leads to take home bags of delicious meaty goodness.Their sausage appetizer and hot grilled buns, are great on their own but better when they are free. Empanadas are great here, but be judicious in getting enough so that you save room for the main star of this place.Searing meat smell, one can smell blocks away. For steaks which are prepared so simply, its unreal how juicy savory and delicious they come out. The grill master should be recognized as the genius that he is. I've tried in vain for years to grill meats, but this place just takes it to a whole new level.Chimichurri, put that on everything. Love the salty garlicy goodness that pairs so well with carne. Parrillada especial for 2 is enough for 3 humans, or even 4 if you are moderate eaters. Their serving portions are heavy.Do get the sangria or house wine if you drink, it's a great way to wash it all down. Parking is always a pain here, but it's really worth it. Next time I want to OD on grilled meats again, this will be one of my go-to's.",La Esquina Criolla
418,"Was a very meh place as a last resort for dinner. Service was nice but it was the food that was disappointing. The bread was ""fresh"" yet so tough. The gnocchi was not the fluffy kind - more dense for sure but what I didn't like was the bolognese sauce with all that ground beef. I just realized upon reading the menu just now was that there was a pesto option too but it was never asked so they brought out the gross bolognese ($20). PAN SEARED BLACK BASS $27 - Shrimp, lemon risotto, capers, parsley. The sea bass was fine but needed some acid. The shrimp were cooked just right. The risotto was not risotto - it was more like just rice. Not the usual dish and I didn't love the olives in it as it did not complement to the light sea bass. My husbands chicken Marsala $21, it was a thick goopy sauce. It has lots of veggies and potatoes. So yes the portions were decent for the price. But overall the food sat heavy - not my kind of food.","If you are looking at booking a group dinner at this location, I am warning you - DO NOT. Prior to our dinner we were required to pay a deposit which was to be deducted from the group's final bill. The restaurant forgot about this deposit and never deducted the price. When I contacted Mike the owner about this he was friendly and said he could not reimburse our credit card for their staff's error but would send a check in the mail. A month later and no check was received. I contacted Mike again who apologized and said he would send another. Another month later and still no check. When I reached out, he said he wasn't sure what happened but would get his accountant to refund our credit card. What happened next? You guessed it - no refund. I have since tried calling the restaurant about 20 times and have sent emails every two weeks. Mike has done an excellent job at ignoring all of our emails as well as ducking all of our phone calls. The level of unprofessionalism that is presented by the owner of this restaurant is absurd. As a meeting planner, I work with over 60 restaurants, hotels, etc. a year and have never dealt with anyone like this.  If this is the way that Mike conducts business regularly, he should be ashamed as this is a scam. There is no chance that I will ever book a group at this restaurant again and I would advise you of the same.","We had good expectations based on the decor, service, reviews etc ... but that was one of the most awful meals I've ever had:( we got undercooked , possibly microwaved salmon with this awful wet gravy on top and chunky pieces of tomatoes all over, and clunky canned vegetables on the side. Presentation, taste, quality of food was all some of the worst I've seen and something you would expect at a diner. Mashed potatoes were completely unsalted and felt like they were from a packet too. This was bad for even an average home cool. We paid $96 dollars for one of the worst restaurants meals of my life. Felt extremely sick afterwards. Don't waste your money","Have been here several times because the food is amazing, but most recently came to celebrate my birthday and Mike and the team at Oro made it a truly amazing night. Food and service are always phenomenal but on a night like tonight the personal touches made it the perfect night. Highly recommend to anyone for a date night, celebration or anything in between.","The homemade pasta, breads and sauces are enough to keep me coming back. Everything tasted so fresh...because it is fresh. The Shrimp Fra Diavolo was plentiful and packed with spice. I also had the Eggplant Rolotini which was so delicate and lightly breaded, it made my mouth water. The Gnocchi and Branzino were absolutely rock star. You have to work for the light flaky fish, but it's worth it. The friendly staff and pleasant environment were a bonus. I want to check out the $1 oysters during happy hour next time. It's very quick to Manhattan on the 7, N or W train.",Excellent service and great food! I love the lamb chop  I will definitely return again when in the area.,Oro Restaurant & Lounge
419,Me and my boyfriend were starving and i remember my coworker telling me that this place's lobster mac and cheese was good so I gave it a shot. We ordered the lobster mac with a west bar burger and pineapple fried rice with shrimp. The burger was decent but the rest of the food was terrible. The macaroni cheese had 2 slivers of lobster and the fried rice was gross. It was sickeningly sweet and the shrimp tasted OLDDDDDDDDD! I was extremely disappointed.Burger 4/5Lobster mac 1/5Pineapple fried rice -7/5,"My first time ordering Uber eats from west bar crab cakes was the worst soggy brown and taste real bad, the Mac n cheese was good but fake crab inside, the fish tacos was a dry and not fresh and topping was not so fresh tasing with vinaigrette I love Jamaican food but, I won't be ordering from west bar again please stop serving those terrible crab of death cakes. Does the owner not taste what the cooks are cooking. My total was almost $40 for the three items that I did not enjoy. I had the taco once before for take out and they were very good and fresh on a Friday night I ordered on a Monday night but that doesn't mean the food has to taste bad",We ate here on a Saturday afternoon. The place was pretty empty and laid back.  We were seated quickly.The food and service was really good. We had pasta with shrimp and chicken. It was very tasty. We also wanted to crab legs and the macaroni and cheese. The crab legs were delicious in a garlic butter sauce. the macaroni and cheese was literally to die for. I will come back just for the macaroni and cheese! The servers came over to check in on us multiple times. They were very responsive and very nice. A few concerns:The crab legs came cold. maybe they were waiting while the rest of the food was being prepared. We brought it to the server's attention and it was rectified quickly.The other concern was that there were multiple fruit flies in the area where we were seated. It was slightly strange and ridiculous. They did offer to move us but by that point we had killed most of them.,"We were looking for a nice spot in Queens to listen to music and dine. We arrived around 10pm and got seated at one of the high tables. It has a cool West Indian/Caribbean vibe. There was a DJ playing hip hop and reggae. We ordered three appetizers and drinks. I got a rum punch, which was great. The second drink I ordered was monkey in a tree or something like that. It contained banana liqueur. When it came it was greenish yellow and it tasted awful. I let my server know and she was kind enough to remove it from the bill.We shared the rum bar wings, escovitch fish tacos and jerk chicken sliders. The rum bar wings were delicious. It had a sweet and tangy sauce with a little bit of a spicy kick. The tacos were so good that we ended up ordering another. It comes with three tacos. The fish is fried to perfection. It was topped with sauteed onions and peppers. The jerk chicken sliders were also delicious. The slider buns were sweet like cocoa bread. The jerk sauce was more like a BBQ sauce or a marinade. The chicken was tender and juicy, not overcooked and dry.I'll definitely add West Bar to my list of to go spots.",Awesome everything is so goodMusic food atmosphere!!!Great Date night or hanging out with the Girls,"Came for Happy Hour during the week and on my birthday. It was about 5 pm. A couple people at the bar. Service to start was less than stellar but improved. I ordered several mixed drinks but I'm tough to please in that area so switched to my wine. For eats my friend and I shared the West End Sampler which included wings (we choose scotch bonnett), grilled shrimp and conch fritters and side order of crab cakes. The wings were ok not too hot, the conch fritters ehh, and the grilled shrimp were ok. Wasn't expecting much with the crab cakes. Never do unless in the DMV lol. So nothing wow but something tells me their dinner entrees are the way to go. People seem to be enjoying their food but this was just a pit stop for us. By the time we were leaving which was 9:30 or so it was getting packed and there was a dj. The vibe is chill and grown here. Will I be back for dinner and re-review? Yes",West Bar & Lounge
420,STAY AWAY! This place attempted to fraudulently charge my card $170 several months after I visited. I was not even in New York when they made the charge.Pollos A La Brasa Mario appears to be a malicious operation.,"Don't go here, first of al the staff is extremely rude. Sorry to say but if you don't like the job you have, or the hours you work or the PLACE you are at , then don't work here. I PAY FOR MY SERVICE, JUST LIKE YOU GUYS PAY FOR YOUR SERVICE ELSEWHERE. On top of that THEY ARE RACISTS towards their own community HISPANICS! If you're not Colombian IT WONT WORK FOR THEM. If you're gay? IT WONT WORK FOR THEM. So why is this place still open?",You can never go wrong coming here they've been a staple to this community for years and have many other locations. I've been to two others but this one out beats them. Service and food portions are worth every penny. What I didn't like was the serving telling me to tip him cash....... hmmmmm? Besides that I'll be back here.,"It was 1am and I was on the LIRR heading back into Queens from Penn Station, when a friend asked me to come through to Woodside. So I get picked up at the station, we start driving, and ask where we're going.. Colombian? Cool, I could totally go for that right now because I've had a few drinks already.Apparently, they're a staple in the neighborhood and already won points with me for being open 24/7. Let's ignore the fact that I was wayyy overdressed for this place since I was coming from a theatre event, but let's be real - no one cares, chances are they're just drunk hungry like you are. The platters are hugeeeee!! One order is enough to feed 2-3 people.Meat lovers rejoice, because you'll find plenty of it here piled high - chicharrón, rotisserie chicken, grilled steak, pork chops, etc. Everything was sooooo authentic and delicious. But warning: Expect to gain like 3 lbs immediately after LOL.",Pollos Mario's is and always will be a guilty pleasure of mine. Service is always only okay and a bit slow but I will always come back for the food. This location is open 24 hours. Staple amazing Colombian food. My favorite is Bandeja Campensino. The pollo a la placha was a little bland. Prices are good and the food will always be good! I've been coming here since a little kid and will always come back when I'm craving Colombian food.,"I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for affordable delicious food in the likes of rice, beans, steak, seafood ect.... it all comes fresh and hot. The restaurant is open late so after a nite out this would be a perfect go to spot! Beware of the line, might be a long wait for a seat but the place is big and spacious with an up and downstairs seating area, we waited like 10mins for a seat but it was worth it. The waiter was fast, friendly and attentive and was very familiar with the menu. I was in the mood for my usual ( seafood ) but then I quickly changed my mind, so I ordered the next best thing (steak) and potatoes. I started with the sangria which was deeelishous!! I'm not a fan of sangria but that restaurant is known for it so I had to try, after the first cup I wanted a pitcher. It was So good!!!!! . Their also known for there pollo (hence the name) so my husband ordered a whole chicken with rice and beans. The pollo was juicy and seasoned amd cooked well, however I wasn't a fan of the beans. As for my skirt steak, i ordered it medium well and it came hot and juicy, nice and Charred and made perfect. I absolutely enjoyed my steak and the red potatoes. The only thing I wish is that I had more. I also wish i had room for dessert would've love to try their dessert but I was stuffed and ready for bed. Would definitely return with friends or family very soon",Pollos A La Brasa Mario
421,"I literally dream about this place. The sauce is perfect, the cheese is gooey but not greasey. YUM. Go here.","I don't really get the hype. It was shut down because they failed their health inspection TWICE. The ""upside-down Sicilian"" (which is their special, trademark item), is overwhelmingly salty and 4 people, who've had it twice, all agree. The pie is cheap though, I'll give you that.",Their pizza is as yummy as I remember it being yearsss ago when I was a little girl! The only think I did not like is that it is cash only! My husband and I walked in tonight to grab a few to go and we could only get 2 slices because we only had 8 bucks in cash on us....bummer! But the pizza is Delicious!!!!!!!,Went into Rosas off of Grand Ave. I no longer live in New York but been coming here on and off for 30 years. Place is cleaner and more courteous to customers since they got there recent A rating. The pizza was excellent. My daughter (in photo) and I shared a plate of Spaghetti marinara. It was also good with very tasty sauce. Then the check came and it was a pleasant surprise and less then we thought. Personally we both think Rosa's food is better then we had in Rome and Rome has good food also. They want you to use table service if you order anything other then pizza and calzone that's not on the line. Service is good and gives the waitress a chance to make some tip money.,"Margherita and Chicken with tomatoes are my favorite. The best thing is that they open until 1-2AM. So if you're hungry and want to grab a good slice, this is the place, the slices are huge. If you go by yourself you can have two slices with a lot of toppings for just $7-8 very cheapBut If you're 2-3 people its better to have a full pie, for freshness, flavor and to save money.",Listen I LOVE this place. I don't even care that they got shut down for a short period of time due to hygiene. They've been a part of my life since I'm a kid. It's the only place my family has ever ordered pizza from. They have so many different kinds of pizza to choose from. You can't get bored. The bathrooms are pretty gross though every time I go in there. I'm taking one star due to cleanliness but seriously their pizza is delicious and their slices are huge for a great price. When I lived in Florida for seven years I specifically missed their pizza lol. Also I wish they took credit cards instead of charging you $2 at their atm.,Rosa's Pizza
422,"Came here for dinner. I entered at 4:45 pm​. When I entered, the place was quiet as it is only opened​ for dinner in the weekdays.Ordered the wake-up​ soup base, which has a funky smell and has napa cabbage​​e.​​ I realized the soup base is basically haejang-guk, or Korean​ hangover soup.At the sauce bar,​ the sauces are limited. I chose what I usually chose. By the time I leave, a large party entered. The place is inside the Fulton Square. Seeing how quiet the mall is and two restaurants have shuttered, I have doubts that most restaurants can stay open for another year.","Other reviews are correct - this place has gone extremely downhill. They should change the name if it's new management because it's reflecting very poorly on what it used to be. I was shocked to hear that it became AYCE (all you can eat.)The place was nearly more than half empty... and the hostess took forever to seat us even though it was pretty dead. Everything from waters, ordering, etc took FOREVER. First the soup came out, then meats, then veggies, then an assortment of everything else was place in a giant bowl. Did not look appetizing or fresh... They used to bring the sauce to you to make at the table, and now it's just a typical buffet style lined up in the front. Not that I ever ate the ice cream but it was a nice treat at the end. They got rid of that too. Servers are not attentive and you have to actually flag them down to get their attention. You can still order a la carte but if the concepts all changed up then I believe the quality doesn't align with what it used to be. SO SAD Mister HP has become like this... Quality of food AND service is 1 star.","Buffet now, service dropped, mainstream boring music, no popsicle at the end of the meal, soup base is now bland. Condiments tray gone replaced with a sad bar. all the things we loved about mister hotpot just went down the drain. At least the restroom is still remain the same with classic turnaround music.","One my Fav Hotpot spot in flushing!!! Love all the large selection of choices on the menu and especially with AYCE hotpot!! I really like the AYCE selection on the menu with all the seafood, meat, Veggies and other stuff I usually ordered from the regular menu and they give you a good amount as always. I highly recommended this place n the service is pretty good too!  As many times,  I've been here n still haven't try the Matcha green base so must gooo back to try it real soooon  !! Yum!","Mr. Hotpot's stunt double has taken over his restaurant.This restaurant has gone through a massive change. I used to come here because it had the best pork bone broth, with real pork bones tenderizing in the soup. Even Mikey Chen reviewed this restaurant prior to the changes made, and he raved about the broth.Here are the changes now:- pork bone broth noticeably lowered in quality- kimchi broth - no more seafood flavor with no more shrimps in the broth- portion sizes smaller- meat worse quality - more fat on fatty meat, tougher to chew on some meat- service and attentiveness declined (they don't take out the fatty soup part for you anymore)- the delicious lemony sauce base is no longer there. Now it's the typical soy sauce, sesame sauce, etc. that you create yourself- some menu items have gone awayThis used to be the best hotpot in Flushing. I would even come here over Haidilao, but now, I don't think I will ever return here. Plenty of other new hot pot places coming up, and I'm sure one of them will have a decent pork bone broth.","The creamy pork bone broth is probably the best bone broth I've had at a hotpot place. However it's unfortunate the flavor gets dilated over the course of the meal because they add regular broth to the pots. Pros:- Great broths- Giant portions of meat (Usually ayce places bring out such small portions)- Free meal on your birthday! (Including 2 days before or 2 days after)- Good service (Staff was attentive and when I asked about free birthday meal because it was 3 days after my birthday they were apologetic they couldn't offer me the deal but offered to give us 2 drinks for free, which was really nice)Cons:- The sacha/bbq sauce was mostly oil and the peanut sauce was super watery- They forgot multiple items we order multiple times. We had to ask them to give us the noodles we ordered 4 times.",Mister Hotpot 鍋大爺
423,Super crowded and hot. Flavor is good... BUT I had food poison within the two hour stay There is only one bathroom and ppl are waiting. Its embarrassing. Not coming back.,Super crowded and hot. Flavor is good... BUT I had food poison within the two hour stay there. There is only one bathroom and ppl are waiting. Its embarrassing. Not coming back.,"IDK but I feel like the quality of skewers went down for this meal. Wagyu, lamb and such were dry as hell and incredibly tough and chewy. Meat was a little over salted and heavy. I was a little disappointed considering how my first time here it was quite memorable. Only saving grace was probably the squid skewers. those were pretty good, but other than that probably won't be coming back soon.",Loved- mushroomLiked- beef with fat- chicken feet- squidOk- xinjiang special lamb too fatty- lamb with fat- grilled pork feetDidn't like- taiwan sausage- cayenne pepper- corn- mala tang spicy hot pot,"I came here towards midnight to satisfy late night munchies and found the food to be alright. It's sort of a tight space with not too many tables. It was actually pretty busy when I went too. The food came out pretty quick and there's a button on the side of the table to notify the staff whenever you need anything. My friends and I were attracted by the 30 skewers for $22 that had a variety of chicken, beef, and lamb but only after we received it, did we realize that they were small skewers. each skewer only had like 2 thin slices of whatever meat it was. We were craving some thick, juicy meat on the skewers. We also tried the beef noodle soup and the wonton soup. The beef noodle soup had a very beefy flavor and pretty good. The wonton soup came with lots of seaweed and cilantro. It was more on a lighter, cleaner broth side. The wontons were just decent. Overall, I would give them a 3.5. The food was not bad and I'm sure their regular skewers might be good but I don't recommend the 30 small skewers. It sounds like a lot but it goes quick and the flavor profile is just not the same as the classic Chinese skewers.","Sadly, Chinese BBQ is kind of hard to come by in NYC (though there are some in Manhattan Chinatown that are decent), so Flushing is one of your best bets for getting a quality experience. I love the cart skewers in Flushing, and I have to note off the bat that I don't think this place beats my favorite cart. However, that's not necessarily the point, as it's a much different experience being able to sit down, relax, and receive service.BBQ here is a not a particularly quick meal, and it's probably better this way. Orders come by themselves, so your meal could end up disjointed, but the benefit is that everything is hot (careful) when you get it. The flavors here, including their ""spicy,"" are not super strong. At the same time, it's not like everything tastes the same here, which I do think is the primary pitfall of some other BBQ places. The meat is also very tender, which is one of the more impressive parts of their skewers... as much as I like cart skewers, they're helped a lot by their selection of very fatty meat chunks, so one could argue it's easier for them to make the meat tasty. The special lamb is probably worth the price compared to their 3 per order one, as that was the best skewer of my visit. The lamb and beef are both solid... I actually like their beef more than I usually like beef in skewers, but both of these skewers are on the smaller side. Chicken heart and gizzards were both solid, so I'd recommend those if you like them. The pork belly/enoki mushrooms were okay, as well as the pork intestine... maybe not something I'd strongly recommend? I'd probably be willing to get everything again, in addition to exploring the rest of the menu if I were to come again, and I have confidence that their menu is pretty strong across the board. I think prices overall are also very fair for you're getting.Service is pretty great here, and they have the button at each table you can press if you need anything. This is probably a place where being able to speak Chinese helps out immensely (even when it comes to finding this place, as I believe ""Friendship"" on Yelp is probably the result of someone translating the restaurant name), as my entire restaurant experience was conducted in Chinese. Their menu does have English translations for everything but the specials though, so I presume one would be fine speaking only English too.Honestly, the hardest part of coming here is that you'll likely have to pass by skewer carts on your way there and back, and so whether it's a temptation to eat early or a feeling of regret afterwards that you didn't spend your money there before, all I'm saying is no one's going to judge you for inflating your skewer count.",Friendship Foods BBQ
424,"My family and I were very excited to go to Taverna today to celebrate my moms birthday. Unfortunately the service was terrible, the waiter at our table did not understand half the things we were saying. At first I tried to order the chocolate liquor they have and he repeatedly asked me ""what?"" And mentioned we don't have that mind you I'm reading it off the menu. Then, I order stuffed lamb because that's what he said was the daily special and when the food comes it ends up being stuffed clam. Then he said he would never say lamb because they don't serve stuffed lamb. To top it off after he got my order wrong I had ordered something else and my family waited with me to get my plate and it never came... over half hour of waiting for 3 shrimps that never made it to the plate and into my belly just because somehow this man got confused and thought I was sharing with my mom and said he didn't think I ordered another plate. Long story short, if you go to restaurants to watch people eat and have your waiter argue with you, this is the place to be.","Great food, as usual. Unbelievable service. The manager Nick had the audacity to push us out of the restaurant because he had people complaining that we weren't eating fast enough! I've been to all of the other locations and this one on a few separate locations and have never experienced this. Dining is an experience- it isn't fun to be harassed. I'm sure if we were men he wouldn't of spoken to us the way he did. I hadn't even finished my beer or dessert and he literally asked us to hurry up. I cannot even believe the poor management. Valentina was absolutely rude- she took our order and then never came back and left us in the hands of maniacal. The whole experience was such a bummer, considering the reputation I hold of Taverna. The General Manager is equally rude...just watching us until we leave- mind you they had a whole room empty on the other side of the restaurant. What a shame...Most Elites review this as 5 stars because of a promotion, don't be fooled.","The food was descent. However, do not order a drink at the bar here.The  very pricey drink the inexperienced bartender poured for me had one ounce of Hendrick's Gin in it. I watched her make it. First time that this has ever happened to me.  Food may be good but refrain from ordering any extraordinarily expensive drinks here which have no substance. If you do, you and your pocket will surely regret it!!","I came for lunch with my mom and her friends today We had branzino grilled octopus fried calamary one salad fried veggie everything came out well seasoned , fresh, the most important super tasty!! Went to long island location before but here super Will definable come back again 4 of us $200but i enjoyed it service is good too ! Love this place highly recommend","I have been trying to go to Taverna Kyclades (in Astoria) for the longest time!  They do not take reservations, and the wait for a table had always been an hr or over.  I was thrilled when they opened this Bayside location!  The Bayside location also doesn't take reservations and yes, there is also a wait for a table, but somehow, it seems more manageable here in Bayside.  My family and I went on a Sat night @6pm, and the wait was half hr...not too bad, and well worth the wait!The table we got was the lone table at the entrance (for 6 ppl).  Definitely not the ideal table since everyone who is waiting for a table is gathered right next to you!  Needless to say, you are being watched for your entire meal. (And let me tell ya, NYers will shamelessly stare at you!).   It would have been nice to sit in the main dining room and get a feel for the vibe of the restaurant, but we didn't want to wait longer for another table since we had 3 seniors with us, and there were no seating provided while waiting for a table. I have to mention that service was great and attentive, even though we were the only table there.Ok, onto the fabulous food!  6 ppl shared this family style dinner:-- grilled octopus: great dish; cooked perfectly; a Must Have!-- fried calamari: pretty standard but delicious.-- mixed veg plate: we had no idea this was fried, thinly sliced eggplant and zucchini...but loved it!  The dill dipping spread really made this dish delish!-- Turbot ($60!): I had never even heard of this type fish, and loved it! Grilled perfectly and even better with a squeeze of lemon! The flavors were very subtle, but I would have preferred bolder flavors.-- Pink Snapper ($90!): I have had red snapper before, but never pink (didn't even know this existed). Another grilled fish, which was delicious (albeit also subtly flavored), but a much denser fish.  For this reason, I preferred the Turbot.-- Lemon potatoes: delicious but the lemon flavor was very subtle.  -- Swiss chard: simply sauteed with olive oil.  This dish was a little too bland for me, but the Swiss chard itself was good.-- Complimentary bread basket: there were two types of crusty bread, drizzled in olive oil.  Delicious and loved it. Try not to eat too much of this great bread and save room for the food.-- Complimentary dessert: everyone got a piece of Galaktoboureko, a Greek custard pie with phyllo.  Not overly sweet, and a great ending to a great meal!  (This was also our queue to finish up and get out! Haha)I felt a tad bit rushed to get out after our meal, but I guess it's understandable since there was a hoard of people waiting for a table.  Overall, a great meal and I'd love to come back for lunch sometime!PS - The Astoria location is going to move into a new larger location!  Stay tuned...","Words can't Express how happy I am, that one of my favorite Greek restaurants is close to home... freaking awesome!Taverna  is held in high regard and I believe lives up to the reputation of its counterpart in Astoria, with a few minute differences in esthetic and atmospheric tone. The service is great, with the waitress, including support staff, being always alert and dutiful. There is really not much to say, besides the obvious. Taverna is one of the best, if not the best, Greek restaurants this side of Queens. I did want to point out that I find the grilled octopus to be the juiciest, tender and delicious peice of seafood appetizer that really has no comparison. It's a must have for sure!!",Taverna Kyclades - Bayside
425,"I've seen the smallest chicken wings at this place.I've seen one as small as half of my pinky finger.I thought their chicken was good at first. With the continuing decreasing in sizes, they are FORCING me to not order from there anymore. What a pity.","This place was OKAY. It definitely did not live up to my expectations from all the five star reviews and ratings. We ordered the ddukboki (rice cakes), donkatsu (pork cutlets), kimbap (Korean sushi rolls) and the jjolmyun (spicy noodles). Unfortunately, everything kind of fell flat in terms of flavor. The dishes were just average and lackluster. You did not get those spicy flavors you expect from a traditional Korean restaurant. Again, nothing tasted bad but it was just meh.","Sodam offers a nice variety of Korean street food, from soondubu, fried wings, kimchi fries to even Vietnamese pho noodles. Although I didn't get the chance to try the pho, everything I tried were solid. The restaurant is very bright and clean. Ironically they ran out of many brands of soju and Korean beer on the night that I was there, not sure if it's always like this there but thought that was odd.",I love this place. We always get the chicken skillet and the wings. The skillet is always great. Super saucy and cheesy. The garlic wings is always crispy. I like to dip it in the skillet sauce. We'll try more stuff next time. The portions are large so it's good to go in a group to try everything.,"So Dam good (haha)Really though, this place is pretty dang delicious. Pretty much your run of the mill korean eats but just done really well. You got your spicy tteokbokki, KorenFC, fried pork cutlets stuffed with the cheese, spicy chicken skillets, kimbap, cheesy fried corn dog, and so much more, I am getting hungry listing the menu items. Good thing is I ate everything I just listed all at one time and can personally say that it was all delicious. The tteokbokki was spicy, hot, and flavorful (and worth the post meal consequences), the spicy chicken skillet with the cheese was hot juicy and cheesy, and the fried pork cutlet, oh it was sodam good. That stuffed cheese was dripping out and I highly recommend getting the curry along with it. The boneless soy garlic fried chicken was also really good, very crunchy and sticky with sauce all evenly coated. The corn dog was crunchy and had that classic cheese pull (good for a boomerang shot, right? might as well) and the kimbap was solid. This is a great spot for dinner, or a place to sober up after a few drinks. All in all, awesome place.","Heard some great things about this place so I decided to check it out. Really wanted the cheesy rice and it was great that the restaurant was able to get the pork out of it as per my request! Didn't expect that, as I usually have to tailor my orders around eating pork instead. Nevertheless, the food was delicious, especially the cheesy rice. It wasn't anything different from what I've had, but the dish is so good everytime anyways. I also had dukbokki and that didn't disappoint at all. Great service too.",Sodam
426,"I am a Chinese American who visited this restaurant with my Spanish boyfriend and his dad. We stayed in the restaurant for about an hour and a half but within 30 minutes, I overheard the entire Chinese staff talking trash about us in Chinese. I only understood because I speak Chinese very fluently and because my boyfriend and his dad didn't understand, they didn't notice. However, the trash that was coming out of their mouth about us was disgusting. They spoke in Chinese about how we were taking to long to eat and talk in the restaurant and that all they wanted was for us to leave. The language they used was very vulgar and disrespectful and made me extremely uncomfortable the entire time. Because the majority of the customers spoke Spanish, they couldn't have understood the waiters who all communicated with each other in Chinese. I can only imagine what they say about other people in front of their face, just in a different language. As much as I enjoyed the food, it's not worth the horrible service.",This place never gets old to me. Its a favorite of mine. I have been going here for almost 20 years now. It's not close to me so I only drive out here on rare occasions plus it's extremely hard to find parking. But the food is always worth it and the price is always right.,"Why nobody told me about this place. And this place has been open since 1970's. The prices are unbelievable cheap!!! Fried steak is $13.95 and comes with plantains and rice or french fries.CHINESE GARDEN !!!They are serving authentic Chinese and Spanish food.Servers are Asian and fluent in Spanish!The decoration is not amazing, they say, its been like that since they opened. Service is fast and prompt.Bathrooms are extremely tiny, they have molds on the ceilings.They have grade pending from Department of Health. Check with their website for any information regarding their grade.Extremely busy place, cash only.",WowI haven't been here in years and decided to stop in ystdy 4 months prego and woke up today and decided to order out and pick up.No parking but Anthony aka Antonio was kind enough to bring it to my carSo sweet and thoughtfulI will be coming back soon.The lomo Saltado is the best in queens here. Identical to the lomo saltado from Lima Peru Price is affordable,"My family and I love coming here after a long day at the beach. When we are all sun tanned out and exhausted and just looking for some good old Chinese food. It's a good local spot that has been in the neighborhood for many years. Don't expect fine dining, but the food served here is certainly good for the soul! My favorite dish is Pechuga de pollo a la parrilla (grilled chicken) with pork fried rice and a big jug of the homemade iced tea!","I've been coming here for about 10 years; it's my go to place whenever I'm in the area and it's  BEST Chinese/Latin infusion.The flavors are perfect , both with the Chinese food flavors and the Latin flavors especially with black beans and the food always taste fresh.My favorite dish:  steak and onions with green/sweet plantains( bistec encebollado with tostones or maduros ) with a side of avocado and black beans .",Jardin De China
427,I ordered food and when I got it I started to eat it and it was disgusting. Never had a problem with the place,"The worst experience. Came here on Christmas Day, barely saw my waiter and on top of that they burned my food. The pita they gave was hard. Not recommended.","This place is a gem. Walking distance from the museum of the moving image, good, clean (vegan) food and beyond friendly and attentive service.  The meze option is the best all around here as you get to sample a lot of authentic Greek dishes. I assume it is meant for 3 or 4 people but we killed it between 2 although we left F-U-L-L! The restaurant is no fancy schmancy, but living and eating my way through tavernas in Greece for 6 months I can firmly say simplicity and freshness is key to Hellenic cuisine. As a carb lover I couldn't get enough of the pita and olive oil, but close seconds were the grilled eggplant, zucchini and olives, the hummus and beets! Last shoutout goes to the Rose tea!","Hands down, Zenon Taverna ALWAYS, always delivers.  The food is predictably good.  It's consistent.  It's always fresh.  The service is amazing every time.  The Kleftiko Spring Lamb is absolutely to die for.  ""Large pieces of bone in American Lamb, with celery, carrots, onions, and potatoes, wrapped individually and baked in the over until very tender.""  Mix that with lemon potatoes and...wow.The food here is heaven.  The owner is also always friendly too.","As much as I was excited to come here and give this place a good rating (because it is a friend's favorite spot) - the excitement died once we ordered and tasted our food. Not that it is an ultimate big deal but, we were all looking forward to lemon potatoes with our meal - it was around 8pm and they had ran out of them. The food was a mixture of good and bad - the dip platter was ok, our fish was TERRIBLE (sea bass) but the chicken kabob was okay and my friend had the octopus which she claimed to love. Wine wasn't great but they have Greek beer which is always a plus for me - crisp and cold! Service was friendly - Overall I was disappointed at their food quality. Perhaps I expected too much since my friend had hyped it up for us.","We really enjoyed our experience here. The food was top quality, flavorful, and plentiful. We would recommend the Meze Meal. There's a lot of food, but you will get to experience a lot of their flavors. The service was great with four servers waiting on our small group. The ambiance was similar to a respectable local restaurant in Europe with mismatched plates that make you feel like you're eating at someone's home. We will certainly be back for more.",Zenon Taverna
428,"My father and I were in the neighborhood and didn't feel like driving further down Kissena towards Main. I saw ""Yu Garden"" and made the wrong assumption that it's associated with Shanghai You Garden on 40th rd, which I've had fantastic dining experiences at. We went in, sat down, and ordered our food. The first dish that came out, drunken chicken, was the one that ruined our experience at this restaurant. I was very excited too as Shaoxing wine is one of my favorite flavors! My father and I looked at each other during our first bite with puzzled faces.... we both realized that the chicken was frozen!!! We spat it out and tried another piece, just to make sure we weren't going crazy and maybe it was an isolated incident, but the second piece confirmed that indeed the chicken was frozen. I asked the waiter kindly to send it back and soon after, the chef/manager came out and had the audacity to explain to us that drunken chicken is a cold dish... This isn't my first rodeo with Shanghainese cuisine; I ordered drunken chicken not frozen chicken! She kept on explaining why it was FROZEN (our refrigerator is on the fritz... UHM, NOT MY PROBLEM) and offered to microwave it for us... I kindly just asked to send it back as we wanted no part of that dish. The XLB was mediocre. The fried rice cake was way too saucy. When we asked for the bill, the waiter looked at me with a sad look in his eye... he knew I shouldn't have been charged for the chicken, but alas, there it was on my bill. I knew it was futile to kill the messenger, so I asked to speak to the chef/manager lady again regarding the charge for FROZEN CHICKEN on my bill. She didn't even bother showing her face this time and the waiter took the FROZEN CHICKEN off my bill. I will never be coming back. Bourdain (may God rest his beautiful soul) must be rolling in his grave for filming an episode of Parts Unknown here as I'm sure he would not have enjoyed the food and service I experienced tonight.","A friend had a craving for beef scallion pancakes so we came here. Quoted a 25 minute wait and we waited about 15 which was nice. They brought around water/tea/cookies while we waited which was great customer service.It was a bit odd that we had to order before we were even seated so it put us on the spot a bit but would rather food come out quicker so it wasn't a big deal.We ordered 2 orders of beef scallion pancakes, rice cakes with seafood, and 2 orders of pan fried dumplings. They were nice enough to bring us free soup dumplings along with free dessert. Never had the rice dumpling soup dessert before but it was phenomenal. It was very nice of them to provide.The ONLY reason why I took off a star is because the restaurant has poor ventilation. The four of us were seated in the back and while we were waiting for the check smelled the most VILE smell coming from the bathrooms. It was enough to make you gag and break dinner etiquette because it was so bad no one could ignore it. Everyone at the table had a laugh about how the person probably needed to see a doctor because that type of smell shouldn't come from a healthy human being. Regardless it's a bathroom so ""sh*t happens"" (literally) but if their bathrooms are going to be so close to the tables they need to have better ventilation or keep a bottle of fabreeze or something in there because I likely would have thrown up at the table had I not already finished eating if I would have smelled that earlier. This doesn't put me off from coming back but I will make a point to be asked not to be seated in the back again.","Like most of the Yelp reviewers here, we too were suckered into coming here because of the late Anthony Bourdain's visit to this Flushing restaurant. So many people held and still hold Anthony Bourdain in such high regards that they'll follow his food path to the end of the world, including myself, but in this case it might have been a poor decision.First off, as of May 2019, the restaurant had a C health inspection rating, so beware that you're really eating at your own risk here, which we did. If you see the C on the window and still go in, prepare for the worst, but hope for the best. But mostly say a prayer first.We arrived here at around 6:30pm on a nice Saturday evening and the restaurant was pretty quiet. Aside from the dismal health inspection rating, one reason for the lack of customers might be the fact that the restaurant is really out of the way and far from what many people deem to be the central point of Flushing. Service was consistent throughout as the one waiter and one waitress were swift, quick and cordial. The menu was just like any other Shanghainese restaurant with almost the same type of items, so we ordered the same things that we typically ordered:Marinated Gluten - aka Kao Fu. First, we had a bit of a hard time finding Kao Fu on the menu until my wife realized this was it, but just named differently. Besides the name, it was odd-looking compared to other restaurants. It had a spongy texture to it and did not have the same flavor as other restaurants. To be honest, it wasn't that appetizing. At first, it was, but we were starving. However, a few pieces into it and we were done with it and couldn't go for it anymore.Shredded Jellyfish - was OK. Nothing noteworthy. Was an average dish of shredded jellyfish. It did come out very quick along with the Marinated Gluten, which meant this was probably sitting somewhere for a while. Crab and Pork Soup Dumpling - I thought the soup dumplings were solid, but it could have been a bit warmer when they arrived. The skin was thin, so they were very, very fragile. I didn't think it was an issue, but my wife wasn't a fan of them.Fried Udon with Spinach and Shredded Pork - Absolutely disappointing. Probably the worst fried udon noodle dish we ever had at a Shanghainese restaurant. The noodles were drenched in soy sauce and there was barely any pork. There were a few pieces of spinach, but literally that was it. Nothing else was in the dish to add a little more flavor. I guess they thought the soy sauce would do the trick.Pan Fried Soup Dumpling - Probably the best dish we ordered, but it was still rather average. The soup in most of the dumplings were dried up against the skin, so there wasn't much soup at all, so it made for a rather mushy breading.Like I said, I would follow Anthony Bourdain's food suggestions to the end of the world, but Yu Garden was so disappointing. Maybe our sky high expectations were a factor, but the moment we saw that C on the window, we knew we were in for something not so good. We should have turned around then.","Young man with glasses was a superstar. From the moment we walked in, he quickly acknowledged us and greeted us warmly. He was the only server in a full house with all tables occupied. It was ultimately a one man show and he was doing a phonemonial job! So much patience even in a very hectic environment when he is constantly running back and forth to the kitchen and every table.When the food came, I quietly mumbled hmm hot sauce, he heard me and brought it out! That is A+ service. We enjoyed the XLB and rice cake dish! Prices are very reasonable.","We visited Yu Garden Dumpling House largely due to the restaurant's Yelp cover photo of late celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain. Dishes We Had:- Crab and Pork Xiaolongbao: The dumplings here use a soy sauce-flavored soup filing, which seemed to mask any crab flavor in the meat filling, and which sharply clashed with vinegar dipping sauce traditionally paired with soup dumplings.- Yangzhou Fried Rice: Bland, and the rice was unevenly hard.- Crispy Noodles with Seafood: The noodles lacked crispness; the sauce was over-thickened with corn starch.Food: Meh (2 of 5). We've had better elsewhere.Service: OK (3 of 5). There is complimentary tea. Interestingly, this place does not do substitutions. One of our party wanted to substitute chicken for pork in a noodle dish, but the restaurant declined the accommodation. Most Chinese restaurants are amenable to such substitutions.Atmosphere: Good (3 of 5).","Yeah, I came here only because Anthony Bourdain talked about it on his show.  Maybe it was good back then, but now these soup dumplings are mediocre/average at best.  Crab soup dumplings barely had any crab taste to them.  Usually when I taste good soup dumplings, I go YUM!!!  But these didn't do anything for me.  After eating 2 dumplings, I didn't particularly want any more.  (Well that's a first!  Usually I want to stuff as many as I can into my face).  The soup inside the dumpling seemed very soy sauce laden.  Very salty.  Which didn't particularly go well with the vinegar dipping sauce.Most places give you a cover over the bamboo steamer of soup dumplings to keep it nice and hot.  This place did not.  None of the other customers in the restaurant had soup dumplings so I don't know if this is how they normally serve it.  Without a cover, the dumplings cooled off quickly and the top knot got a bit hard.Also ordered yang zhou fried rice.  Bland.  Nothing particularly tasty about it.  Needed some hot sauce to kick it up a notch.Across from the bathroom, there is a small sectioned off area, where you can see workers making soup dumplings.Important note:   if you are thinking about checking this place out.  They refuse to do any protein substitutions.  I wanted to order chicken with pan fried noodles.  All they had was pork or seafood versions.  So I asked the waiter if I can have chicken substituted instead of pork pan fried noodles.  He said no, then quickly walked away.  How hard is it to throw some chicken in there instead of pork?  What's up with that?  I've never been in an asian restaurant that refused to do a simple protein substitution.",Yu Garden Dumpling House
429,"Been here too many times and must say the only thing that is consistently good is their empanadas. Asides from that nothing really deserves praise.I think their rottesseri chicken is very bland. The skin is the best part, past that it's all just plain chicken meat, unseasoned.Their lomo saltado is their best steak dish. Last time I went (my most disappointing) we ordered two skirt steaks. They were both terrible and way too chewy. When I tried one of the steaks I thought we got the piece that was mostly fat but they both were horrific. I doubt I'm coming back here in the near future. However I'm only giving them two stars because they are BYOB and you can easily always get a table for a big group here.","Very bad luck, we had. Apparently, the chef was absent that day and someone else cooked the smelly octopus ceviche. Yuck. Service was good, but slow.",The food has lately been so up and down here. We ordered from here last night and honestly the only thing edible was the chicken. The plantains were super hard and tasted old. The rice was all clumped up (ugh I'm getting nauseated just writing about it). I've given them a few chances but yesterday was it for me. I'll be ordering from rice n beans in Woodside they're a little bit more pricy but at least the food won't be going straight into the trash. NEXT!,"Surprised I haven't reviewed this yet! We come here and order from here all the time. Best Peruvian spot in NYC in our opinion. The food is amazing, service is always good, and it's properly priced. Definitely ask for the aji verde (green sauce). We like the molcajete, otherwise I'm happy with just their chicken (it's very good).","This is strictly a delivery review. We ordered a chicken quesadilla, nachos and chicken tacos. All of our food was not seasoned and tasted stale. Our nachos was ordered without meat, but chicken was stuffed in and underneath all the chips. I use to enjoy coming in to the restaurant for dinners, but they have ways to improve their to-go services.","Came here for my sister's birthday and the food was pretty delicious and the service wasn't that bad neither. The place was kinda empty for a Friday night which I enjoyed because that meant my family could have a nice quiet dinner.  It's BYOB so you're allowed to bring your own alcohol which I thought was a nice touch. Reason I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 5 is because of what happened after we received the bill.  We brought our own birthday cake and apparently they charge a $14 fee for bringing your own cake that we were unaware of.  When the matter was addressed, they said the person who made a reservation didn't notify them that we were bringing a cake, this may be true, but we did call them a few hours before our reservations to ask if we could bring a cake and the only thing they said was how big was the cake.  They never mentioned there would be a fee if we brought it, if they told us about the fee when we called, we wouldn't have brought the cake.  They saw us bring in the cake, put the cake in the fridge for us, brought the cake out with a candle and played ""Happy Birthday"" on the speakers, served us the cake, never mentioning a fee not even once and then charge us an extra $14 for it on the bill!! That was really sneaky of them!! After much deliberation, they finally agreed to take off the charge, but this is definitely something that should have been mentioned either on the website or the menu. Extremely shady to me!",Mezquite Restaurant
430,Very chill vibe and good selection of drinks! Music isn't loud so you can actually hold conversations.,I was in the neighborhood and I have been here before for a few ales .This place is an Ale House yet the beer I had was disappointing I had a St.Bernardus Tripel which is usually an excellent strong Belgian Trappiste Ale On tap it was not warm but not cold either and frankly night fresh and crisp tasting I complained to the bartender just so they were aware,"That old fashioned chicken sandwich is absolutely disgusting. The gravy is an unappetizing color and tastes like it's made from cow parts that's been rotting for weeks. Why would you load a mayo filled coleslaw on a sandwich with friend chicken, mashed potatoes AND gravy. You're asking for it to be disgusting--just put some of that shit on the side. The biscuit is so dry, and even when fully cooked still manages to take like raw dough. I used to like Sunswick, now I just feel like I'm wasting money ordering from here. The tomato soup and grilled cheese used to be good until I realized that you only get it two ways: oily and sickening or cold with hardened cheese.","First time at the restaurant, lots of beer options, food is great, especially Roasted Beets salad. Used fresh fruits and beets, tasty wings, and veggie nachos, big enough for two to share! Staff was helpful and friendly! Bing go night, thinking to join the group next time when I be back. Everything we had was good!","This is small cool spot to get Mexican breakfast as well as some other healthy options. The place is really small and they have some seats, but most people take it to go. The coffee is little pricey, but the best meal option is the steak burrito.","Decided to check out this bar from a recommendation from a friend. I've always walked past it but never went inside. I've always thought it was a tiny bar, and going inside it was still pretty small. I do love their large assortment of beer offerings all presented on an electronic screen. Staff seems really friendly. Great pitcher deal. We ended up getting $26 IPA pitcher. Food was pretty good. Very flavorful and delicious. Downside there is no waitress service and you have to place all your orders at the bar. Other than that, will have to check it out again. They have trivia nights on certain days.",Sunswick
431,"Legit. Taste better than other kimbap places and they're stuffed, not skimpy. Get kkaennip  (perilla leaves) in your tuna kimbap for .25 more. It's worth it. That's how they do it in Korea. Mmmm I missed this taste.","Food is very inexpensive and hits the spot when you are craving some Korean food. They did not skimp out on the ingredients in the Kimbab, and it was very fresh! Rice cakes were very delicious and not too spicy. I love that there was banchan (side dishes) to munch on as you are waiting for your food. The soup was also given, but nothing too special. Highly recommend~","I just came to this restaurant and had a bad experience with the owner/manager (I presume) who rudely laughed at me when I asked to take my left overs to go. I guess he assumed there was only a little amount. He says: ""you want this to go haha"" & points to the leftovers laughing. I replied ""yes I want it to go because I paid for it"" and he continues to laugh and walks away with the plate. This location doesn't taste good like the location in Spring field. And the fact that this owner or manager is a complete rude asshole. I will not be back. The server was a girl who was very nice. But because of the manager/owner being rude to me for no reason, the tip was also lowered.","Cheap, yummy Korean food?? What can get better than this. Everyone time I come, they serve large portions, good quality food, and our bill is always $20 or less for 2 people! I prefer this location to the Springfield one because it's more spacious and has fewer people. If you're craving Korean, definitely check this place out over the other places on Northern because they have THE BEST prices around. I definitely recommend the dukkbokki and bulgogi kimbap (all their kimbaps are so fresh) and flavorful! Will definitely be back :) Price: 5/5Ambience: 5/5Food: 5/5","I don't like kimbabs in general because they tend to taste bland BUUUUUT the Spicy Tuna, Crab Salad and one that's wrapped by a fried egg is REALLY GOOD. best being the spicy tuna one. I tried their kimchi fried rice and it's pretty okay BUUUUUUUT  for $2 add mozzarella cheese then it becomes really good. I mean you can add it yourself or as for it. The portion for kimchi fried rice is huuuuge. So it's worth the price.This place does take a bit of time to prepare your food. It's a little stuffy in there and it's small so there's not many seats but I've never eaten there before. I only ever got to-go. The cashier is very kind/polite welcoming and thanking you and speaks English very well. Sometimes I wait outside and he brings me my order. I come here once a week because I always have a hankering for their kimchi fried rice and/or spicy tuna kimbab! Definitely recommend!!",Small little spot to get your kimbap fix. Their menu is extensive so you can really order anything for anyone. I love their spicy tuna kimbap. All kimbaps are made to order which makes it super fresh and not soggy or mushy.,Rolly Kimbab
432,"Highly unimpressed. Nothing at all like the Long Island locations. I asked for a burger - medium well - and this thing is so well done, that it's dry beyond belief (See the photo for yourself). Not appetizing. For $17, this was a waste of money and highly disappointing. Should have stuck to making my own burgers for dinner.Also, the service today on a Sunday is incredibly slow. No one has come to check on us for almost a half hour.They have a lot of work to do. Not coming back anytime soon.Edit: I had to go inside to finally get a manager since our server never came back to check on us. He graciously apologized and took the burnt burger to show the kitchen staff. Still upset this even had to happen.Edit 2: The manager came over, apologized again, took the burger off the check, and told us to seek out a manager next time we visit. So, let's see what happens next time. (This courtesy bumped my review up by one star.)","Food is 4 star, service is 3 star.I came here with a friend for a bite and a beer. Both of our burgers were really good, cooked to the level we wanted, and came decently quickly. Drink orders were infrequent, and it took us a long time to get and then pay our check when time came to leave. It was moderately busy the night we were there, but our server was tending to the tables all around us, but not us. I will likely be back, and perhaps I'll update if I have a different experience next time.","I only popped in here to watch the AFC championship game, which was on a bitterly cold night. I sat at the bar, and asked for a hot beverage, which they didn't have any of. Specifically, I asked for something hot (like a hot chocolate maybe?) with some Bailey's thrown in. Like I said, no go. I just got the main, first beer on the menu: the burgerology brew (or something like that), which costed $6 and tasted bad. I only drank about a fourth of it, but that wasn't so much because it was THAT bad, but mostly because I only came in to watch the game and less because I wanted to drink.Anyway, the restaurant's service is fine. It's clean, and has several television at the bar. I can't vouch for it much more than that because all I did was have a fraction of a beer and watch the game, but I would go back to watch the game if I had to and was in the neighborhood.","My experience, in its entirety, was excellent and ultimately perfect. The host and waitress served my friend and I with smiles on their faces and radiated good vibes.The ambience of the restaurant was very cute and cool, the weather was extra warm and sunny the day of my visit so there was the option to sit outdoors but we choose against it - The outdoor seating looked very cute though.The menu offers plenty of options aside from burgers like sandwiches, Mac and cheese, salad etc. and allows plenty of freedom to experiment  when ordering a burger. The burger menu is composed of a BYOB option and the predesigned burgers of the restaurant.Unfortunately, I was extra hungry once I arrived and didn't take the time to photograph our meal as I usually do BUT the Edison burger that I ordered was out of this world! Composed of a fried egg , bacon jam, maple aioli on top of their signature blend beef patty - the Edison found a special place in my heart! The bacon jam and maple aioli were major hits on the burger. 10/10. Recommend.My fellow burger lover ordered the Eisenstein burger which is composed of braised short ribs,Swiss cheese, caramelized onions, and gravy on top of their signature  beef patty. While I did not get to taste that burger myself, my friend reported that it was delicious and I don't doubt it since he devoured it immediately.We also got a side of truffle fries and basic Mac and cheese, both of which were good (not the stars of the meal but good enough).In addition, the rosé and frosé tasted delicious. As a huge lover of  burgers, I must give this place a gold star of major approval- I shall be returning.*Side note: I don't recall the name of our server or host (I'm very bad at remembering names, unfortunately) but if I do remember them I'll be sure to add them to this review because they contributed greatly to my positive experience here.  They deserve acknowledgement!","Good burgers!We stopped by Burgerology for dinner on a Friday evening and were pleased with the food and service. The menu has a nice variety of items ranging from sharables to sandwiches to specialty burgers. Additionally,  they have an amazing over the top milkshake menu, which we will have to try on future visits. On this visit we sampled a variety of burgers and their Rueben sandwich, which my wife said was delicious.  I had the Henry Ford burger-bacon blend patty with bacon, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and house sauce. This burger rocked! The others in our group did a BYOB (build your own burger)-which they enjoyed and the Eddie the Greek-lamb blend with tzatziki sauce (very good). Burgerology offers gluten free buns, which is a bonus.  We were vastly disappointed with the house fries that came with the burgers, which I would rate a 2 at the best. Limp and flavorless. The ones our group was served looked nothing like the photos or the ones we saw as we walked through the restaurant. This was a huge disappointment. While the burgers and sandwich were great and reasonable in price for Astoria, they really need to step up the consistency of fry game.","The service and food both amazing. Jordan , not only adorable and charming, is an amazing mixologist. The staff and management friendly and very accommodating. Truffle fries, Mac and Cheese and Burgers were all fantastic.",Burgerology
433,"Extremely disappointed. This restaurant has been a staple on Bell Blvd for years so I'm thinking it must be good since it's stuck around so long. Ordered the lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo, carbonara and baked clams to go. Everything tasted like frozen microwave food. Carbonara was bland, way too many mushrooms, not enough bacon, no cheese. The Alfredo was also very bland despite it swimming in cheese sauce. The baked clams were mushy even with the bread crumbs topping. There is nothing to rave about here. I'm sure a long time ago the food was better given the older reviews. Tastes worse than Olive Garden.","Was craving good Italian food tonight so after looking into yelp I came for dinner with my other half after reading the review. The ambiance was nice and friendly staff throughout the evening. Definitely a plus.Unfortunately, the calamari appetizer wasn't the best I've had and the two pasta dishes we ordered weren't too special. We ordered a bottle of wine for $40 which wasn't even that great. Kind of disappointed but would potentially go back since it's close to home.",There are much better Italian restaurants in Bayside .  Was seated promptly but staff not focused and took forever to get our food . No one seemed to care . Don't think that we will go back underwhelmed,"We had my nephew's graduation party here. The room was the perfect size for a party of 25-ish people. We got there to set up about two hours before the party started and someone was already there to help us if we had any questions. They supplied us with a Bluetooth speaker and microphone for speeches. Overall, the two staff members who helped us throughout the night were phenomenal. Probably some of the best customer service ever.I have to say that the food was equally impressive. We got garlic bread (which happened to be just some of the best I've ever had; who knew garlic bread could get better than it already was!), cold antipasto (cheese, salad, olives), hot antipasto (calamari, eggplant, fried oysters), pasta and the main course (choice of chicken or salmon), and a tiramisu with cappuccinos. Everything was delicious! Everyone kept raving about how nice the place was and how good the food was. We had a total of four hours to hold the space and at the end of the night the staff members cleaned up everything for us, even all the decorations we brought. This was such a great experience that we'd love to host one here again in the future. Or even just come to eat =)","Celebrating our dear,sweet friend's birthday with dinner here, my very 1st time..Sooo.our waiter,Edwin was exceptional!. The attention to all, no empty water glass , can go on and on!I felt like our round  table was the center of attention ! Every restaurant should have a ""round table!"".

I can not describe how much happiness and surprise my mother, and all of our family and friends responded to the cake. Everyone thought it was a real bag!!! Not only was the cake delicious and exactly how I pictured, the staff was friendly and polite. I spoke to Javier, who was an amazing help!!!

435,The food is saltier and spicier than year ago and the portion is so small. I won't go back.,"I used to come here with my bf for lunch all the time, we ordered the bulgogi over rice and dukbokki. After the second time the bulgogi over rice tasted different we thought it was just one day.. but next two times we came back oh no, weird taste. Also ordering some fish cake and rice balls is too overpriced for the amount they give you. atmosphere is nice though.",This place is consistent with their flavors whenever I crave for spicy 'ddukboki' Generally accommodating when I don't want certain ingredients due to my diet.,It's awesome It's less spicy and more sweet than the one I had in KoreaBut it's great to enjoy the great dduk bok ee in AmericaThe amount of food is way less than Korean's I definitely visit later,"This is probably one of the best places to get spicy rice cakes. Theyre chewy and the sides pair super well with the spicy sauce. Dont be fooled by the spicy levels, there are times the very mild is too spicy, but that could be the slight inconsistency of the cooking. So just be careful with that. My party ordered the assorted rice cakes with a load of sides, their kimchi fried rice with cheese and their cheese ribs. (Make sure to eat the cheese hot, or else it'll just be a clumpy mess). We got very mild for the rice cakes and ribs and they were very good. The ribs were not spicy at all and the rice cakes were just right for me and my friends. Maybe next time we'll move up a level. As for service, it was busy but the waitresses were very quick and attentive. The food came out super fast too which was a huge plus for us. Overall great place for good food! Theres dessert around the area too.","We actually drove over two hours to get there. This franchise is pretty famous. So our hopes and expectations were great. Perhaps way too great..We went during lunch. One or two tables of customers were there. We ordered small modeum yupdduk with mild spicy, budae jjigae with side of 2 piece of dumpling and fish cakes, mini kimbab, hamburger cheese katsu roll.. First, we should have ordered spicy or more. Mild was not spicy at all! Portion was super small... cheese was too solid, it did not go well with rice cake at all (not like melted cheese) we asked to make it more spicy but they said they couldnt since its already cookedSecond , budae jjigae was huge disappointment. Not flavorful at all... third, mini kimbab? I expected the ones that i had back in korea , comfort food i had had in my childhood... but it was just.... plain... nothing addictive Fourth, hamburger cheese katsu was good just for few pieces. No more than that. But it's alot and expensiveOverall, check came out little over $60. And I regretted going that far for the food that was not worthyWaste of money, time, and toll",Yupdduk Flushing
436,First time to eat here and I was disappointed. I ordered grilled shrimp instead of a traditional Greek dish and maybe that is why food was nothing special.  Eat the food that the restaurant is known for and stay away from the non traditional dishes.  The pita bread was delicious and the free dessert at the end of the meal was good. We ordered the antipasto and it was ok. ( I did not care for all the dips that were served) I will be back to eat a traditional Greek dish.,One of the big three Greek restaurants by Ditmars stop (with Telly's and Kyclades). Food and atmosphere pretty identical to Telly's which is one block away. Always can get in there without a wait (big plus vs Kyclades).,Do yourself a favor and don't go for dinner at Stamatis on Saturday night! It's a nightmare! We had reservation for 7 pm the waiter took our order at 7:50 pm after few times trying to allocate him and wave at him so he can grace us with his presence. We got some appetizers within 15 minutes and he forgot about us. We got our main course at 9 p.m. we were party of 8 for all of our orders he brought one side of lemon potatoes and one side of rice to share while on the menu each main dish we ordered was listed with side dish. We got one refill of water after we had to wave and ask . It's sad that a restaurant that offers good food has hit and miss service. Oh and the waiter included his tip in the total of the tip you simply have no say if he deserves tip he demands tip. I'm not going back once again every time I stop by Stamatis is disappointment.,"Food is amazing and prices AWESOME! LoveIt when the restaurant is not too busy bwcause it gets really packed and loud. When we go around 3-4 late lunch, it is perfect. Service is veey attentive and friendly. They always offer free dessert. ItIs kids friendly as well!!!","Why would anyone to here when they can go to the probably 100 other places in the neighborhood that are so much better??The salad had ""crumbled"" feta that didn't taste fresh, enough said! The chicken was dry and the fish was super boney: The beef was the only thing I enjoyed. I can't say I hated it, but I can say that I'll never go back.","My friend raved about the place and having experienced this place for myself I can certainly understand why! I came here with a group of 4 for a late lunch and we were seated immediately in the center of the airy, spacious dining area. The interior was lovely, fillled with gorgeous paintings of Greece, dolphins and more. Though it was a little on the loud side, we were still able to hear one another without having to raise our voices. The ambiance was cheerful with a feeling of calm, due to the blue lighting and the white / blue color scheme. We were served complimentary garlic bread which was thick and warm, however a bit tough. My friends ordered a side of beets and Greek salad, along with their meal. I tried a bit of both and they were tasty and fresh. The beets were soft with nice herb seasoning. The Greek salad consisted of crunchy lettuce, red onion, tomatoes, olives and plenty of crumbled feta cheese. There was olive oil, vinegar and pepper for the dressing - Simple, yet delightful. For my main course, I decided to go with the grilled salmon with lemon potatoes, which was absolutely delicious - Perfectly cooked, made with olive oil and seasoned with oregano. The ingredients were not complicated but everything mingled together so well. The salmon was wonderfully tender, slightly crispy, very juicy, and mouthwateringly flaky. It was a generous size and the price of $23 was reasonable. The lemon potatoes were served on a separate plate and pretty enjoyable. It had a distinct lemon and peppery flavor and was smooth. We were given free dessert of galaktoboureko, a traditional Greek dessert of semolina custard in phyllo dough. This was incredibly delectable! It was flavored with a hint of orange and tasted of custard, thin phyllo and very sweet syrup. It was divine! Our waiter was great - Friendly and knew the menu well. One thing to keep in mind is that the food takes awhile to prepare, probably because they cook everything fresh so I didn't mind too much. However, it is best to come when you have plenty of time to fully enjoy the feast you order. I would definitely return, as there are so many yummy sounding offerings on the menu.",Stamatis Restaurant
437,"I'm updating my review from last week.  Although I was unhappy with the service that day I also understand what Nata was saying. Also with the number of times I've been there over the years, I think I should take all the visits and meals into consideration for my review. As I almost always have a 5 star experience and meal I am changing my review to 5 stars. And yes I will come back next time I am in nyc","I have loved this place for many years but the past several times I have been here, the service has deteriorated dramatically.  The food remains excellent...hence the 3 stars.  But to the point ...around 30 minutes ago they brought my takeout box and complementary dessert. Yet no check and the server has not even looked my direction despite serving another group on the patio. Since she doesn't look my way I cannot get her attention. So I guess I am reduced to chasing her down. That should NEVER be necessary.  I may, very unfortunately, be finished with Gregory's. I'm even starting to wonder if there is a point when I am morally entitled to leave without paying.  Gregory's, tell me please, wtf has happened to you????",Very disappointed about the dishes ordered: Roasted Quails with Lemon potatoes side (it came dry and burn on one side). Another dish: Salted Cod: strange taste. I don't recommend this restaurant. Too expensive for what service they offer.,"This place has all the charm and quality of a little taverna on the shores of Santorini. With all the Greek options in Astoria, don't skip out on this one. It's exquisite and extremely authentic!Me and my boyfriend went because we were craving calamari. We sat outside, and though it was a hot summer night, the outdoor seating added to the experience. We ordered a Greek salad (feta was amazing), some tzatziki (some of the best I've had) and calamari. Everything was fresh and extremely flavorful. Service was friendly and the food came out quick. I can't wait to go back and try more of the things on their menu. Such a neighborhood gem!",Gregory's is fantastic! It's a great homey taverna with fantastic Greek food.The service is excellent. The prices are very fare. And the food is very tasty! We had the Crab Stuffed Sole and it was delicious. A wonderful experience all around and I highly recommend it to one and all!,"Gregory's is a solidly good Greek restaurant.  Starting off with the decor, red and white checkered table cloths adorn the outdoor seating area.  When I saw those I immediately began to enjoy the cozy vibes.  Inside its just as pleasant, chock full of paraphernalia relating to Greece, fishing and boating along the walls.  The wait staff was friendly and efficient.  Seating is cramped but not unenjoyable, and this is only because of how tiny the restaurant itself is.  It's truly like you're sitting in a large living room.  The food was all good.  It wasn't good enough to surpass my two Greek favorites in Astoria (Bahari and Aliada) but it's good enough that I'd return to Gregory's as a regular for sure.  The saganaki and the octopus were good, and so were the kolokithokeftedes.  The crab cakes were definitely tasty, but were filled with fake crab meat- I didn't quite understand why that would be on the menu.  Oh, and they serve Fix (a Greek beer) here! Recommended!",Gregory's 26 Corner Taverna
438,I come here all the time. My company orders lunch here at least once a week and the food is consistant. Actually prefer it over pio pio.,Be aware! This restaurant is infested with cockroaches. Our meal was ruined when the cockroaches showed up around our table. Staff gave us a bill we had to pay.,Horrible ‼ There was hair in my food and when I called them to tell them about it they got mad at me but thank god I have my proof I took videos and pictures. Didn't go for a while because of what happen gave it a try once again and there was hair in my food again. I'm so disappointed and really upset never going back ‼ the nyc health department needs to go there ASAP ‼,"Been coming to this place for many years now. The food, the flavors, the quantity is all great. Is kind of small but great vibes, sometimes on Friday nights after 8pm or so they will have live music.  The prices are good because you get a good amount of food. Love to order the Lomo Salteado, bistec a lo pobre is really good too as well as the seafood platters. My Only problem with the place is that they always over cook the meat. Not sure if is bad quality meat or that the chef over cooks it. Other than that is a nice place to get some Peruvian food.","Giving this place 5 stars because I've never had a problem with it. I didn't want to be a food snob and say sometimes my peruvian grandma makes these dishes better   but I always love what I get when I'm here. Today I went to lunch with my family where we shared a Ceviche Mixto, with everything tasting fresh. My sisters shared a Tallerines Verdes which wasn't bad. for anyone who doesn't know what it is, it's a creamy pesto sauce with linguini.  I had Pescado a lo Macho which is one of my favorites. That's a fried fish filet in a yummy sauce. I wouldn't be able to tell you what kind of sauce but honestly try it. They top it with shrimp, squid, calamari, some crab and or mussels. I almost always get it because it's not something my family makes at home. It's amazing here. Fish is always soft.","As of lately this is my favorite place to dine, where do I begin, -the seasoning on the chicken is perfect everytime-customer service is very fast and ALWAYS friendly -great peruvian art as decor -great environment with music in background-huge portion for great valueMy eyes twinkle when I think about this place, I always recommend to my friends and strangersSangria is amazing sip slow it sneaks up",El Pollo Inka Peru
439,Is this place a joke? I went there bcuz the place was on my hotel 's dining guide. I ordered a pork Raman. It came with only 2 tiny mini little pieces of pork meat for $15. What a ripped off! Is this an instant noodle? It's so awful. I left after 5 mins getting my bowl. Not even want to touch it. I had to buy some food on the street vendor afterwards and it's much better than that. This is seriously a scam.,"Resobox was a little disappointing. We came on a Sunday afternoon and the service was a bit slow even though there weren't many people in the restaurant at all (3 other people). They had one art exhibition on display but I think it's different from the other pictures on Yelp. Overall, the food wasn't anything special. The beef udon was way too salty, and the regular udon and ramen were edible but not particularly memorable.","Horrible and horrible.Ordered 2 ramens and gyu-don. Found a hair even before eating my spicy miso ramen so told the waitress right away. Of course, I didn't even touch my noodle after seeing the hair inside of my bowl and didn't want to stay longer so asked for a check. What comes next? I had to pay for my noodle which I didn't even touch. Yes, they've given me 10% off and don't mind paying for other 2 entrees but not for the one with hair inside. Was it the best for you guys to do? Thank you so much for the worst customer service.","Mmm mm Raaaamennn!First off, this is just an adorable place. But what makes it so sweet is the lady who works there (sorry I didn't catch her name). She is unbelievably sweet and really made the experience. The inside has a clean aesthetic and there are works of art lining the walls. I love the little chopsticks holders hehe. Tonkotsu Ramen- I loved the pork belly in this. The broth was rich and tasty. I would like it to have been piping hot but it was very delicious. Also passed the salty test- I didn't wake up in the middle of the night gasping for water which was good. Ask for the ground chili pepper to add for a nice kick. Will go for extra pork belly next time for sure. And thanks for the amazing service. Really really sweet lady!",I thought this place was also connected to a culture center. And surprised it's really a ramen shop that displays art work. And provides cultural activity on off hours. Selection of options quite a variety. I thoroughly enjoyed the dishes. The latte drinks were extremely good too. We previously orders via seamless for delivery. Items were packaged very well and tasted good. Eating in person even better. There's only a few tables. But well worth the wait,I thought this place was also connected to a culture center.

440,"I always come here in the winter for their chicken stuffed with ginseng and sticky rice soup! It's just the best I've ever had. Customer service is bad though, the girl always passes by our table and doesn't refill our glass of water. we asked for the check twice and she doesn't bring it. Only when she puts it on the table she smiles and says thank you, just for the tip? Anyways, every time I come here is the sameeese problem, maybe because I'm not Asian but that's just outrageous.","Food is good and all but be aware to those of you whom are allergic to peanuts. Apparently this restaurant uses peanut butter in their stew/soups. This is not a regular ingredient in Korean dishes especially in soups. I think they should disclose to their customers about their ""special ingredient"". My son who is allergic to peanuts had gope-chang(intestine) soup before from other restaurants. We also know that  normally there are no peanuts in this stew. He ate the soup from this restaurant and suffered greatly! My heart was breaking watching him suffer. Luckily benadryl did its job but those of you  who have serious allergic reactions please please be careful!","This place is moderately priced but the whole restaurant seemed dirty and old. The bathroom was a hot mess. Only the service was decent. The banchan was meh too. The vegetables were not fresh, especially the leeks and the kimchi in the kimchi jigae. The food was either too salty or too bland. Would not recommend. There's better Korean food elsewhere.","This is one of my regular places for good unfussy unpretentious korean food. The owner and staff are nice people and try their best to serve the throngs of customers that come. They are that busy.Some of the stand out dishes are -don katsu pork (bigger than most places, crispy too)-Sang gye tang (boiled chicken) with sticky rice and herbal stuffing -soon dae (blood sausage) by itself or in soup-jjok bal moo-chim (pork feet, cooked sliced and mixed with fresh vegetable) for those that enjoy pork feet, this is good. Perfect pairing with soju.As in the name, the place focuses on health and well-being of their customers. Coupled with genuine nice staff/owner, they get my business often.Good for takeout too.Support your local businesses.","Had lunch there today: Sam Gae Tang-pretty good, nice thick broth, clean tasting; dolsot bibimbp- very good with variety of veggies; bulgogi dupbap- soup was slightly sweet and soothing - meat wqs good.Banchan sides were abundant and they refilled quickly.Overall good meal.","Hansol Nutrition Center is not noticeable, hidden between bigger restaurants and you might miss it easily. Their decor is simple, kind of old but let you feel like home. The waiters are nice, welcoming and attentive to give us recommendations at our first time here. Their food was authentic, traditional and quality-cooked Korean food with huge portion and reasonable price. We ordered Jokbal Boochu Moochim and Young Yang Sam Gey Tang and we even couldn't finish half. We loved Yong Yang Sam Gey Tang which was really healthy delicious, the chicken was braised really soft and the soup was light. Besides, their served sides with good variety and they were also tasty.",Hansol Nutrition Center
441,"had to return our beers due to dirty draft lines, and the wine is really cheap compared to the price charged. pizza was decent but no where near the quality of other wood fired pizza in brooklyn. for a cash only place it should be much more well priced.","I Was excited about trying this place out for a While  cuz of the hype and my love of pizza and the fact that it's so close but it was disappointing for sure. Started off with our server making a passive aggressive comment about how we shouldn't stack our menus if we aren't ready to order. 2 out of 3 of us were ready and had put our menus to the side but one was still deciding, the server even  took our menus from the side and placed them back in front of us which was strange and rude. Another server told us there was a pepper dish on special but when we tried to order it we were told there is no pepper special also in kind of a condescending way. Anyway we ordered a calzone, the artichoke pie,  the prosciutto starter and the eggplant special. It was all pretty mediocre. My biggest issue honestly was that on the menu it says the calzone comes with sauce (as it should all calzones COME WITH SAUCE) how ever when it came out it was dry with no sauce I ask about the sauce and was told the sauce is baked on top the sauce she was referring to was cooked off so not wet at all nothing like a sauce. So that's misleading and lame, right? Ordered more sauce paid 2$ for 2 oz of sauce. If I'm already spending 19$ on a calzone if should come with sauce. the food was all meh nothing great, nothing worth coming back for. I understand that the ingredients are higher quality but for those prices I'm expecting better. Did not live up to the hype or the prices.","The pizza was really delicious! Tough to find though, signage isn't great. It's cash only",The pizza margeherita was delicious. Just like the pizza we had in Italy. Not an imitation. Just the real deal.The decor is interesting and the crowd is young. Very friendly staff make it even better.We absolutely recommend this venue if you want real Italian pizza.,"Just a disclaimer: this review is mainly based on the gluten free pizza!So trying to find Houdini was almost a mission itself, hint: it will say Houdini above (slightly to the right of) the entrance.Came here after work and there was only one other couple sitting which i was happy about because i was STARVING. When i found out they had gluten free options i was stoked; my favorite gluten free pizza spot in Williamsburg closed down and I was hoping this could be a replacement. Sadly, i was slightly disappointed. I got the Houdini Green (the one with the veggies), and thought it tasted...almost flavorless. I drizzled the chili pepper oil, added some pepper, and still could barely get it to taste great. The crust, was hard in some places and soft in the others, veggies were over-grilled, and the sauce was lacking flavor.I've heard great things about their pizza so maybe it's just their gluten free pizza that's a bust? What i did love about this spot was that it was kind of hidden. It doesn't draw much of a crowd on the weekdays which can be great if you just want to chill and enjoy someone's (or your own) company. There is seating outside of the restaurant - however, there is still a cover over that area which is great to shield you from the sun or rain. Overall, this place definitely has potential but i'm not sure i would come back for their gluten free pizza.",Came here Sunday at 11 for brunch.  It seemed like they had staff waiting around to clock in even though they had two large parties to serve. The drinks were great the spicy sausage pizza was okay but the marinara was great.   I would come back hopefully with a more attentive staff,Houdini Kitchen Laboratory
442,"Sometimes the grey clouds cluster together and block out the sun.Sometimes your spinnaker wont catch the wind and is left hanging limp and lifeless over your bow.Sometimes your kids dont text you back.And sometimes you encounter a serving staff that takes hold of your life for a time and turns the dial on your day. That happened to me at Ida's Nearabout today. These two parted the clouds and let the sun roar down upon my face. They redirected the sea breeze into my sails, and I overcame my wake (while on a run I might add).They showed me that my phone was on airplane mode this whole time and my kids had actually texted me many times, worried and unsure of my whereabouts.Come to Ida's if you're ready to set sail into golden new day on a ship made of joy!","I've meant to update my review for some time now, as my more recent experiences here haven't been as pleasant as the first.To start, their cocktails are either weak or made with poor-quality liquor (and in the case of their margaritas, premade mix). Furthermore, their food isn't anything special and for the portion sizes, a bit expensive at that. The service is also hit or miss, and lately it has been miss.While I wouldn't go out of my way to return, I'd go again in the event that friends wanted to meet here.","Haven't been for a little while,but last time I went was disappointed. The waitress was not nearly as attentive as other waiters before. And my meal was not enjoyed,never got my beer served,and water was forgotten too!I have full faith that next time I go back it will be a better experience.","Hands down: The BEST cocktail bar in Sunnyside (and Woodside and Astoria).

The elderflower drink was just vodka and lemonade, the server was not feeling it at all, restaurant seems a bit unkept, my fries were close to burnt - thankfully I like them crispy, grilled cheese was more greasy than yummy. Wish it was more of a hit than a miss. Good thing Queens is a big place.","Cool, somewhat divey bar. A bit of taxidermy on the wall behind the bar. Solid happy hour till 7PM. Extremely friendly staff.Good local beers. Strong mixed cocktails. Fair NYC prices.Fine enough (enough) food, though I only had the popcorn chicken.

443,The food didn't have any flavor and the rice was hard as a rock. The tequeños weren't good. No wonder they were free,"Good food , but that place in the summer it's a fucking oven , I don't know why they didn't turn on the AC shit , went there to have some food and get out all wet that's it's nasty , please turn the fucking ac in the summer",So the food can be tasty but beware it depends on I suppose how the chef is feeling that day because sometimes the food is Really dry,"I love this place!! My boyfriend and I went for the second time and I checked in with him and got a free ""pequeno"" it's like a small empanada with cheese, but in a different shape.The service was good, usually when u go in you order at the register first and they will bring your food. Us not knowing we just sat down but they still brought us the menu. The two ladies were friendly and cool.You can create your own ""Patacon sandwich"" or you choose from the menu they ones they have already created. I created mine with shredded beef, fried egg and black beans. Because it already comes with lettuce, tomato and fried cheese. It's not bad for the price, not that expensive either. I would so recommend This place on the weekdays because they get a lot of people on weekends and they only have like 6 tables.","Small place with only seating for 10, but it was ok with the big open window, music and simple but colorful decor. Ordering is easy. There is an option for design-your-own or just pick from the ready options. Had the patacon cubano, with ham, pulled roast pork, sour pickles, queso blanco and salsa verde (mayo with greens) sandwiched by plantains. Although it was a bit messy to eat as a sandwich, I was ok with a fork and knife, while adding a little bit of each of the salsas. Very tasty and satisfying.  Tamarind drink is good too. With all the other options, will have to return to this one (because I like the ambiance and also LES is a place I haven't explored) or one near us in Queens.","I am so glad I found this place. it's sort of a hole in the wall and actually this is my first time trying Venezuelan food. Glad that they execute it so well and make my first try a good one. I ordered Patacon Paisa and also got a free Tequeno from Yelp check in. Both items were awesome!!!i'm not usually big on cheese but the Tequeno is tasty! it's basically fried dough with cheese filling. it was served warm, the dough has the right chewiness, the cheese wasn't too strong, it tasted even better with the sauces. it definitely made a great appetizer.Patacon is basically a sandwich with flattened plantain as bun instead of bread and I think it's great! i went for Paisa because I don't want any cheese. the fillings for Paisa were really tasty, saucy, and the flavor works together well. generous meat. decent portion too overall. I really enjoyed the meal. the price was not bad. service was very friendly. note that there's minimum $10 if you want to use card. i'm excited to come back and try the other dishes especially arepas",Patacon Pisao
444,"Came here during lunch, so I ordered from their lunch menu. I got the country fried steak and eggs hoagie and I was very disappointed. The whole things was flavorless and the fried steak was mainly batter and barely any steak. It's supposed to come wit bacon but I didn't get any bacon... and the mash potato was way too salty. Service sucks, waited 15 mins just to get my check. Overall I am very disappointed.",Went here for the first time and thePlace had about a few scattered guest eating or most with no food on the table. Abundant amount of empty tables and they made me and my guest wait for about 15 mins. Staff very ghetto talking about personal things in front of guests. Not one smile. They sat us after the long wait in an almost empty restaurant. The host was super unwelcoming. Taking our orders with a like hurry up demeanor. On the menu my drink said that it came in a copper cup with nice straw and I order it looking forward to the taste and look of it. My drink came in a regular soda tall glass with a tiny black straw. Nothing like the description. My steak was the size of a kids fist. Smash potatoes dry and steamed broccoli soggy. My partners pasta had literally no seasoning.  No flavor. The staff kept walking by just focus on each other rather than the customer.  The table felt sticky and the place did not smell clean. I will never go back here again. All I wanted to do is leave.,"If you go here make sure you either sit at the bar or change your table if your server is Valentina. Absolutely horrible. She didn't refill waters once, didn't bring lemons when we asked or at all actually, forgot our jalapeños, didn't ask how our food was, and we wanted to buy more alcohol ...which would increase the bill and also her tip??? But she was nowhere to be found. All the tables around us were complaining about her too. Seriously. Just leave if she's your server. I left pissed",Miller ale house is a favorite of me and my wife's..I just recently found out about this place through my wife .this restaurant was pretty cool from all of the tv screens on the wall .I think they were showing a huge soccer match that night.The atmosphere was rocking and mellow at the same time the bar was jumping a lot of people just getting off from work .came to check out the game and get some drinks. This place gives you the vibe of a huge large cabin but with a cool restaurant feeling at the same time .The prices weren't bad we enjoyed the food I think I ordered the cheese burger and French fries and a crispy chicken sandwich. And wifey ordered the grilled salmon with 2 sides. The cocktails weren't to expensive there wasn't cheap ether.

445,"This used to be one of my local favorites. I usually crave the Mee Goreng. For a while they had change the menu and added some Taiwanese dishes which worked in my favor because I can satisfy several cravings at one time. Usually the stinky tofu, the oyster omelette, and the Mee Goreng. The restaurant was closed for almost 4 months and after they reopened I went back and everything tasted different. I assume they had to hire a new chef due to the long closure but it was truly disappointing. The stinky tofu was not crispy, wasn't very stinky, and the preserved vegetables served on the side had not been preserved very long and had no flavor. However, the sauce was still really good. The Mee Goreng didn't have the kick like before and it tasted just like a Chinese lo mein and there was one shrimp in the entire dish. It is usually a mix of different things but there are usually at least four shrimp so this dish was kind of sad besides not tasting the way it supposed to.They really need to bring back the old chef or find someone who actually knows how to cook the original Malaysian dishes or I fear that they will probably close again but this time for different reasons.",I found a bug in my food we.

We specifically asked for a change to an item we were ordering and he said it was fine.  Then, at the end he repeated our order incorrectly. Another lady had to step in. We got our food correctly, but it took them a few minutes to get us folks. All the food items were too salty or didn't taste fresh. I saw one group of people sit down and take off shortly after and another walk away from the front of the store. I wonder how they stay in business.","This place is gorgeous! Im a Malaysian, at here i got the same taste that i had in Malaysia. Truly authentic Malaysian food in the city ever! Their price are inexpensive as they served big portion. $12 for lunch special you could choose 2 main dishes and a soup come with a rice. $15 for supper special 2 main dishes and 2 congee (which is my favorite). Staff are you nice and polite, even though some of them might be freshman that doesn't bother me to have good food here. I dont know how come they got some 1 star rating, but im sure they worth more than that. Because you didn't order what they good at, doesn't mean they cant make good food. For sure, ordered a pad thai here is stupid, pad thai is a food from Thailand not Malaysia. This place definitely worth your try if you would like to have authentic Malaysian food. I wish i live near to this place so i could dine here everyday.",Yummy delicious yummy yummy deliciousI dine here 5 times a week Best part they open till 2am,"A tasty Malaysian restaurant that also serve Taiwanese and Chinese/Canton food in their lunch special menu that comes with two large plates and a big bowl of rice and soup. Their Thai iced tea, ABC ice, and roti canai are all very delicious! The asam laska is very flavorful, but not enough noodles inside. Will definitely come back to try other Malaysian platters!",Pulau Pinang
446,"I haven't written a review for this place because I don't want you all to know about it, but alas there's always a wait so I guess what harm could it do now.1- Cash ONLY.  BUT it really is shockingly cheap so if you forget this you might still be ok with whatever you happen to carry in your wallet lol2- ALL VEGETARIAN- Thank you!!!!! 3- Very cool vibe. The place is big enough to be intimate but also have a group come in. The decor is all Ethiopian themed and the wait staff are always niceI could literally eat Ethiopian food all day every day- probably don't go alone bc its a more interactive type of cuisine as you eat with your hands and the injera, but damn its soooo good.",Came for my cousin 26 Birthday to try something new. She been her numerous of times. I enjoyed the Ethiopian food for the first time. It's always good to try new things and be open to new food. We didn't make it in time for the coffee ceremony but everyone speaking very highly of the coffee ceremony.,"Incredible food and organic wine, incredible atmosphere, incredible staff. Just go here!","As someone with embarrassingly little knowledge about Ethiopian food and culture, I can only say that the food here is incredible, the ambience is divine, and it's cash only. Bunna (aka coffee) ceremony every Wed and Fri at 6pm, Sat and Sun at 5pm. If you participate you get free bunna! Any coffee shop should definitely try the origin of their favorite drink.  They offer both Ethiopian beers and a handful of domestic craft beers.If you're alone, try the Meal-size Beyaynetu $14, your choice of 5 entrees in small portions over injera.  If you've ever eaten Indian food with naan, you'll get the hang of nomming on this delicious cuisine.","A happy, energetic environment to enjoy an Ethiopian feast on a Wednesday night. There was a 20-min wait at 8:00PM for 3 eaters. A live band and music playing were an added bonus to our meal - maybe every Wednesday is live music?Our trio had the two orders of sambusas, 'feast for 3', a bottle of pinotage, and finished off with baklava. Recommend 'feasting' so you're able to try all the dishes they whip up, with some rotating out seasonally. The rolls of injera flatbread were a perfect vehicle for picking up the nine dishes (they come in little mountains on a MASSIVE feast platter) - bouncy, tart sourdough to net the rich savoriness. Shared piece of baklava was a sweet ending to the meal.","K.C. and N.S. and I came here after a foray into the Bushwick climbing gym Metrorock. K.C. had been here a few times before and thus recommended the platter for two. Apparently the platter for three was more than enough food for a group of 5. So, we got the full combination of nine different sides made up of all sorts of things, collard greens, ground lentils, beans, pickled veggies, etc. The platter itself was served all at once and had a repeat of the sides on each side of the plate. It helped save us from having to rotate the dish. The fermented flatbread to pick up the sides was, as you'd expect, a little sour (I believe its actually sourdough based) but not so sour as to upset your stomach. We did end up needing an extra side of bread but it was well worth it. So why 4 stars? Ethiopian isnt my favorite cuisine but it was well seasoned and had a nice balance of flavors. Additionally, when I've had the flatbread in the past, I've gotten upset stomachs quite quickly afterwards. The bread here has a nice balance of flavor and fermentation which added to the dishes and made it easier on my stomach. Will give it a try again in a few months!",Bunna Cafe
447,"Terrible experience. Brunch is a really hard thing to mess up but these guys managed to do it. First off, our waiter had the attention span of a cabbage and barely checked on us and forgot to put in our order of oysters. Then when we received the oysters they were a half dozen instead of the dozen that we asked for.Now on to the food. Mind you, we cleared our plates because our hangovers needed it, but that didn't change the fact that the food was terrible. I asked for runny poached eggs but they were completely over done.Any who, don't want to waste more time and characters telling you guys how bad this place is. Avoid getting brunch here at all costs.","Food is delicious! I had the shrimp stuffed with crab meat and pasta with lobster. However walking in here is not welcoming at all. I was disappointed especially since there weren't many customers inside. We entered and the bartender was by the entrance (no hello) seemed bored. I said hello. The waiter was not attentive at all for a place that's nearly empty. We finished our dinner and couldn't wait to leave, so we get up and again...no ""thank you for coming"". I regretted tipping. Not coming back here.Regardless of  how good the food may be, customer service is always important.","Yesterday, I came in with my husband for dinner, and before you can say, ""oops,"" a comedy of errors ensued as we ordered dinner.  First, my husband ordered a drink that never came.  I ordered lobster bisque soup, but our main dishes arrived before the soup, so I told the waiter to take it off.  Then when we were finally ready to have dessert and coffee, the creme brûlée also mysteriously vanished, but we got our expresso and coffee first.  The waiter told us that the dessert would be on the house, and he was right about that, but what could excuse him for his sloppy service in the first place?  Was he distracted, tired, or what?","My husband and I ate dinner here Sunday night with my husband's parents. The restaurant was pretty empty at around 6:45 when we arrived (we had a reservation anyway) however it did fill up as we were eating.Overall, we were very satisfied with our food. All our appetizers and entrees, including the crab cake, octopus, baked clams, and various seafood entrees were delicious. Minus one star for service. Our water are barely refilled throughout the night. Also, when we asked our waiter for a dry white wine recommendation, he really did not seem sure and recommended the Riesling, which wasn't even grouped with the other whites on the list, but instead with the rose and sparking wines. Luckily he offered us a taste of it and it was extremely sweet. We ended up ordering another wine instead.",Serving was fantastic and kind dedicated Like food but little bit pricy thoughBut we had a good time in this townNice interior,"I've been here at least four times and they have never failed to please on all levels. The service is great, the staff is highly personable, the environment is warm and welcoming and the food is awesome. In some ways, it's a hidden Forest Hills gem and I say in some ways because there are a lot of great eateries in the area. This one just feels like one of the more quaint and somewhat upper scale places in the area with old-world charm.",Reef Restaurant
448,Came here on a double date. Each of us ordered one of the hibachi combos. 60-80 minutes later I'm having terrible cramps and need to use the bathroom. 2 hours later I'm violently ill and have been throwing up almost every half hour. I don't know what the hell happened but I skipped lunch and just had a banana because I knew we were getting hibachi for dinner so there is no other food culprit. I got very sick after eating here and will probably have terrible flash backs now if anyone mentions hibachi.,Came for the food after almost 3 years. Left with diarrhea in 60 minutes......Quality has diminished. My wife had hibachi shrimp while I had the dragon roll and hibachi asparagus. I had a single piece of shrimp off of her plate. She didn't touch my roll or asparagus. We were both on the shitter the entire night. Any guess as to what caused it???Lucky I didn't get food poisoning. I still have an odd taste in my mouth. Not going here again. I would post a picture but it's not one you want to see.,Love the sushi and their lychee martinis.  Been two the hibachi side twice.  I don't care for it.,"Have been to this place on a few occasions and the hibachi has never disappointed. Wait time : i have always been seated immediately & without reservation.  They have plenty of tables so I don't think It will ever be a long wait, they also seem to be able to accommodate large groups at request. Cleanliness: I love the idea of the food being prepped in front of you and the cleanliness stands up to my expectations.  The grills and hood ranges are spotless and I have yet to see anything that would give me pause.  Food/Drink: The staff is attentive and continuously checks on the table asking if there is anything that we needed but not overly interruptive. The chefs are talented and entertaining, they do their normal range of tricks and make it fun and exciting for the table.  Nothing is better than being interactive with your meal.  The food portions and also very generous you get soup, salad, your choice of protein , Veggies, rice and noodles / bean sprouts and a shrimp appetizer.    I have never left hungry.  The specialty drinks are a little strong, but that could be a benefit depending on who you're asking. The overall atmosphere and experience here at Shiro is impressive.  They cater to a busy area and seem to be thriving.  I would recommend Shiro to anyone looking for a good Hibachi restaurant.","I really wanted to like this place, especially since it's in one of my favorite places: Atlas Park... but, not even the area could save it.It is so worn and tattered that I didn't feel comfortable sitting down. It just didn't feel or look clean anywhere but on the Sushi side.The windows are cloudy, the seats are ripped, and also mismatched. The lighting is poor and I didn't want to touch much. However, comma, the food is surprisingly very tasty! I wish it would come with a better ambiance but it was flavorful.The hibachi performance and presentation felt a little inauthentic but.. they did try. It lacked the finesse that you would usually find in an authentic Japanese hibachi. Perhaps because it's not run or operated by those of Japanese descent? Umm, I would be interested in re-visiting after some much needed renovations. They just need to learn that they need them first ‍","Fun atmosphere, creative cook Nelson made a play out of it, and generous portions.  The date chose well a second time.",Shiro of Japan
449,2 stars for a good tasting pizza-1 star because my pizza was mishandled during delivery ( see pic) -1 star because it's pricer than other options in the area-1 star because the cheese and sauce had major separation - the cheese was literally sliding off the pizza which made it unenjoyable,"Been coming to Lucia for years.Lucia Pizza is very busy. They only have 6 wall stools, to sit and eat. Otherwise stand and eat. A slice of cheese pizza is $2.00. A pie of cheese pizza is $20.00. Cash only.Cooked with regular metal oven . Regular slice is thin crust and thin dough. Tomatoe sauce and mozzarella cheese is spreads evenly..Walk in and scream out your order to 3-4 cashiers, they will scream it back to oven. LolAsk for plastic fork. Napkins and spices are on the mirror wall.Writing this review is making my mouth watery again. I will be back.","I would give it 4.7 stars if I could. If the crust was tastier, I'd give it 5 stars. Still it's one of the best slices in NYC. Get the regular slice, the Sicilian isn't great.","Perfect classic old school cheese slice and my favorite cheese slice in Queens! This is a classic pizzeria that reminds me of my childhood favorite in Brooklyn. Everything from the old fashioned stools, menu, and the soda fountain machine. Classic cheese slice is my go-to here. I love the crispy texture of the pizza dough and how cheesy it is when I bite into it. It had just the right amount of tomato sauce and it tastes so good! You get your slice pipping hot so don't burn yourself!",Update to reply to owner:Thanks for your kind words- there are no other details besides what I stated and posted. Hopefully if I decided to try this place again it will come normally.,"Delicious pizza with proper New York crust. When you fold a slice, it should never crack or break. This crust and sauce is PERFECT! Only reason I could not give it five stars:-the location (extremely busy area with no parking)-the seating (there's only about eight barstools in a tight pizza parlor).",Lucia Pizza
450,"I'm mixed about this place and here is why...My mother had my bridal shower here exactly 2 years ago.  The service was HORRIBLE! It was a Spanish women with a nasty attitude! You could not ask her for anything especially a new wine bottle when the other was empty (meanwhile my mom paid for Unlimited beer and wine) the party ended at I think 8pm, by 730 the lady was cleaning the room and basically throwing us out. My mom had to cut and serve the cake. The waitress also left 1 coffee pot with cups on a servers tray stand for people to get their own coffee! (What are we paying you for?!) Then I had a ton of gifts that the lady basically throw me out in the cold with, out the back door in the driveway to sit and wait till my husband and parents made 3 trips to out house with the gifts. They basically threw all of us out and i sat by myself in the cold with my gifts in a not so great neighborhood!! I ended up giving the lady a piece of my mind and she didnt like that very much and snapped back at me. Shes lucky I didnt go ape on her.....Now tonight, my best friend had her rehearsal dinner here. It was amazing! The waiter reggie, omg, he is a gem!!!!!!! What a difference from what I had, that thing the called a human being lmaooo...Reggie was such a fun and kind man. On his Game!!!!!!! They need more people like him! But what made me mad tonight even more so, was the fact that my friends dinner was 5 to 10 and it is now 11:47pm and were leaving now! Reggie and the staff tonight did not at all rush us or throw us out! So this is why I'm torn. The 3 stars were for Reggie and tonight, if this review was based on my shower, it would be -5 stars cause my shower sucked because of that rude miserable you know what.","This place was an absolute pit! The chicken parm was hard as a hockey puck and after being sent back and another brought out, the second one was rubbery and not edible. The chicken for my grilled chicken salad was dry and bland. The spinach was swimming in a nasty dressing. The cokes tasted as if they'd been sitting in a sewer. The staff were friendly, but slow. The decor is old and out dated. Place needs a complete makeover.  Along with a chef who knows how to cook food. Avoid at all costs!!!",Great service and super friendly staff but hands down the grossest food I have ever ingested. At one point I literally considered taking it away from my daughter in fear of her body rejecting it. I didn't even know you could make a cheese stick inedible but they managed it. The pizza you were served as a child in grade school would be gourmet compared to this stuff. I'd keep going but I'm going to be sick now.,Never had a bad meal at this place. Food is authentic and honest! The Mussels are amazing and the linguini Pescatore is to die for!,Love this place... large food portions..large selection of local beers that just keep growing. They added great over head music which changed the dynamic of the bar area. Friday nights is karaoke and it's a blast... definitely my go to spot..,"Had dinner at the bar since on the road solo.  Ordered the cavatelli country style platter.  Flavor was ok, sausage was the only good part.  Not enough garlic flavor and no basil flavor in the sauce.    Definitely won't try this plate again.  Beer on tap selection wasn't bad at all.  Tried a couple of new ones from LIC and Other Half.  Salad was average, bread was not warm.  Service was very slow.  Guy next to me had to wave down the bartender twice.  Lady on other side of me waited 5 minutes at the bar before even approached.  Overall disappointed with everything especially after reading some of the reviews.  Gave them a 2nd chance.  The eggplant rollatini was good but again took forever to get the check",Pine Restaurant & Sports Bar

I definitely come back to try other things on menu.",I'm sorry Mattie I stopped by on Sunday for lunch. Hoping you were not there. You were. We took a table. I saw you were having tap beer problems computer problems and working with a very eager to learn bus/ waiter My last review I was very harsh about Your attitude Well I'm sorry after watching you You and that young man did wonders So did your chef Magic with veggies. So the food is always great the drinks are top of the line.  Try a tap bee or 2. You won't go wrong Say hi to Mattie Olivia and the guys that put Dutchkills on the map. Thank you. I'll be there more often and more appreciative,"The food was so good! We had the steak, risotto, arugula salad, olives, and chicken Cesar salad which were all amazing. The pomegranate mules were excellent. Even though we were throughly full we had dessert too!  The mint ice cream sandwich was yummy!We had super friendly service and fun conversation with other patrons.","Came here for the first time. The sangria was excellent, my husband had the burger with swiss cheese and fries and since I just ate I decided to go for dessert which was the creme brûlée'.

453,"During our most recent trip to NYC, we stumbled upon a random street fair with vendors all around. One of these vendors was a Peking Duck sandwich place with ridiculous prices (2 for $10). Knowing that we were going to make a stop in Flushing, we opted to find a Peking Duck sandwich place in Flushing instead to satisfy our craving. And, that's where Peking Duck Sandwich Stall comes into play - the location was kind of hard to find (it's in Corner 28 in the way back). I would say, be prepared to have a Chinese speaker with you (seems like they prefer Mandarin but they understand Cantonese fine). At $1.25 a piece, it's hard to complain, but this isn't somewhere you should go out of your way to try. The skin on the duck wasn't crispy, and the baos were nice and soft, but the only flavor that you could taste is just hoisin sauce. Perhaps if we read these reviews prior to trying it, we might have enjoyed it more with less sauce. Even still, the duck is not the hero of this dish and that's just a plain shame. Cash only.","I wasn't too impressed by the Peking duck sandwich. The flavor was fine, but the meat to bao ratio was low, so it tasted overwhelmingly of just bao. It's 4 for $5, so fine for the price! I did enjoy the chive dumplings they sell in the same space (a different stall sells dim sum items). There is plenty of seating upstairs so you can pick what you like and sit down to eat.","Decided to stop by while in Flushing after watching Buzzfeed's video on Peking Duck, and was a little disappointed. The duck was crispy and tender, and the bun was soft. But the sauce was lacking, and there were way too many green onions. I didn't enjoy the aftertaste of the sauce, and in every bite I took, I almost only tasted green onions. I ended up picking the remaining pieces out to finish the bun.","Wandering through Flushing looking for this stall, I felt like I was playing I Spy! This stall is extremely difficult to find, but the trick is to look for a wall covered with heavy long strands of rubber? chains? Hard to describe, but you'll definitely have to look hard - and when you find the place, you'll wiggle your way through the narrow passageway and into the very back where the stall is.At $1 each, the Peking duck sandwiches here were fresh, sweet, and delicious - but most of all, affordable too! Each fluffy white bun contains several cuts of fresh scallions, one to two slices of the delicious lean duck meat, and the traditional sweet sauce drizzled all over. Absolutely delectable! Once you order the sandwiches in the back, there's a narrow stairway to the top that you'll be able to see. It opens up into this clean and open dining area for people to sit down and eat, which is where my friends and I went shortly after receiving our food. It was all very authentically Chinese and absolutely delicious! I would come back again. Cash only though! Remember to bring plenty of it since you'll be using it all haha!","The location of this sandwich stall is a bit overwhelming. You're not really sure what you're walking into. On the right hand side you have your roast meats and wonton noodles, on the left hand side you have sushi. Where's the duck??I found this stall only because they posted two big photos of Peking duck buns on the back wall labeled with the price tag $1.25. I wasn't sure where to order but I figured making eye contact with one of the Asian ladies has got to do it. It's crowded here so you won't be able to eat inside. I ordered two buns and they packed it to go with plenty of napkins. Before I left, I heard another couple order 10 more! The buns were pretty soft, sauce was good and they were generous with the duck. You really can't beat the price! I wouldn't go out of my way for this place but I wouldn't mind coming here  for a quick fix of Peking duck if it's on the way.","My friend and I were about to leave Flushing, but I just couldn't survive that 2 hour commute home without a snack in hand! So I suggested getting peking duck buns, and Yelp led me here. The store is tucked in the back behind other mini shops. You will know when you see the peking duck poster! For $1.25, you cannot beat the price! I have had peking duck buns in restaurants before, and they barely give you any meat. Here, you get the full packaged deal: the skin, the meat, chives, and plenty of hoisin sauce. Compared to other places, the ratio of bread to stuffing was perfect! And the taste of the crispy skinned meat with soft bread was delicious! I will definitely go back again the next time I need a quick bite!",Peking Duck Sandwich Stall
454,Admittedly and perhaps my own technical knowledge is not up to date. But your damned fancy urinal made a mess of my britches and my Thom Mcan's.,"Ordered food for pickup a few days ago. We haven't had Shake Shack in such a long time and I used to like their burgers years ago before when SS was simply in Madison Square Park but seriously.. these burgers are so damn salty now. We both had a SmokeShack and yes bacon is salty... Who doesn't love bacon.. but along with an over-seasoned greasy beef patty is salt overload. I could not finish it and it's not like these are big burgers. Even McDonalds doesn't ""taste"" as salty in comparison. The cherry peppers actually helped a lot. I should've added veggies to the burger cuz it really needed it but I forgot to add them since I was trying to order and pick up ASAP. So my fault for not taking the time to customize our burgers. Regardless I think I'm over Shake Shack. The food is just too salty...","After getting off the bus on my way to Queens Center Mall, I happened to past by this Shake Shack and decided to give it a try for a late lunch. I ordered a SmokeShack (which I accidentally called it SmokeShake which the cashier politely corrected) as well as a small lemonade. Keep in mind that the cashier location is near the entrance to the rest of the mall and it used to the previous location of Urban Outfitters. There seems to be four separate lines to stand in to order and then after ordering, I was given a buzzer to let me know when my order would be ready for pick up. While I was waiting, I found a high seat in a table with others and sat down to wait for my food. When the buzzer went off, I went back to the counter but my food still wasn't ready yet. So I awkwardly stood at the counter and waited a few more minutes before a tray with my meal was placed on the table. When I touched the tray, it was wet and it was a bit large for holding just a single burger and a drink. After getting back to my seat, I took a bite out of the SmokeShack and it was a little disappointing compared to other SmokeShack that I've had in the past at other locations. More specifically, the temperature of the burger wasn't warm and the bacon tasted a bit dry. Given that the price of the meal was overly expensive compared to the taste of the burger, I would personally consider going to another location instead and pass on this one.",Shake shack this burger joint speaks for it self. I have been to this location at QCM.a few times for take out with my wife. The order is always fast no matter how crowded the restaurant is .top notch customer service .It is so awesome to have a shake shack at my favorite mall.to be able to get that great shake shack taste after a nice day out shopping at some  of your favorite stores. You can't beat that ..from there milk shakes to there crinkle seasoned cheese French fries .wow !!!And there cheese burgers are cut above the rest. In a class by it self. I like my cheese burgers well done with a nice crispy crunch to it with ketchup and mustard. Along with lettuce and tomatoes..that makes for a tasting burger to me.i have to rank there cheese burgers #1 in my book in the burger business. I have been to many burger joints and they dont compare to shake shacks And I cant forget about there crispy chicken sandwich with cheese a little spicy with lettuce and tomatoes I got this sandwich in my top 3 chicken sandwiches that I have ever tasted at a fast food restaurant .So I would definitely go back to this particular location in QCM in the future,"I wrote and published a review for this SS and now it's gone. **Wide eye stare**Thank God for backup reviews AND copy and paste. I'm seriously not accustomed to such amazing service from a fast food joint. The young staff is extremely polite, engaging, helpful and accommodating. They serve you as if it's a five star establishment so five stars is what they get from me. I've never had to get up for a refill here as the staff is always walking around making sure we're okay. If they notice your drink going down they offer to get a new one served in a fresh cup.They're always cleaning up after customers so tables are on point. (Some of us still clean **nudge nudge**).I'm not a burger fan but I'm in some serious love with their Angus beef burger. I love its smell, texture and taste. So yummy. Bathroom code remains the same which I apprecilike. I love this Shake Shack! The End.","Love that they opened a shake shack so close to home. It's super convenient that it's in the queens center mall as well.Nothing better than a little shopping and some good eats. It's shake shack, the burgers are delicious and the fries are always fresh.The lines are a little long but they have supplemented by adding self service kiosks.. so no complaints, and what's a little wait when your food is guaranteed to be amazing! The staff is friendly too, although some are new and were not able to answer my questions, they went above and beyond to get me an answer so kudos to them!",Shake Shack
455,"I was here yesterday. I liked their lamb kebab, but there were long lines, no line management and their outdoor seating with rusty chairs had seen better days. Note they are a halal restaurant. Their menu is reasonable. $7.00 for the kebab sandwich","Ordered their merguez sandwich and meat combo platter.  Worst sandwich that I've had in my life- threw away 70% of the sandwich. The meat was extremely dry and tasteless, the bread was stale and tasted like card board, and the white sauce was watered down.  Their meat combo was not worth the price. The meat platter came with a mound of rice and very little meat. There was no salad as advertised. The rice was normal. The meat platter was supposed to be served with lamb, kefta, and chicken.  I received lamb, chicken, and more dry, tasteless merquez and very little of each. I do have to say that the lamb was better than average. Overall not worth the money. You're better off going to Duzan a few doors down.",Still on the hunt for a righteous tagine which seems impossible to find in nyc area. Settled for freshly cooked chicken on order in a toasted French bread with flavors of vegetables. Spearmint mint in green tea was offered with no sugar and washed down the 5 star sandwich priced (less than) right.,I love  the Moroccan Harris chick pea   soup here. It's also nice to sit outdoors in the summer. I would also recommend the lamb with Cous cous they have on Friday's. Food is fresh and  tasty. service is friendly.,"Delicious and cheap Moroccan food! It's also Halal. The inside is a bit cramped with a couple of stool seating, but there are outdoor tables. I had the merguez sandwich, chicken tagine, and sweet paratha all for under $20. They were all delicious! The lamb merguez sandwich was flavorful and not dry. The bread was also very good, slightly crispy on the outside and not hard. I didn't even need a drink to wash it down. The tagine dishes comes with rice and two vegetable sides (potatoes and peas) which were all delicious. The only negative is that the breast part of the chicken was a bit dry but that's always the problem when cooking chicken. I would definitely come back again!","This small restaurant is always very popular. Inside seating is limited. It's too cold to sit outside so inside the restaurant is packed. When the weather is nice, many people chill in outside seating but when it's cold it seems like many people just quick eat and go so more people will be able to eat there.I never got tajine with tajine plate before but I go there often enough? I always get tajine plate now. It helps food to stay hot. I don't know how they decide the price. One day very very low price. One day it gets little more but still good price. Sometimes I get little bothered  by getting defferent prices from the same food I ordered before. The food is worth the price anyway.Many workers don't speak good English but they are all very nice and friendly. Please just be patient. I have been trying to tell them I dont want green peas but they kept giving me so I gave up and eat them. Yeah, I can eat green peas now. They are actually good.",Little Morocco
456,"My wife and I just finished having our dinner.I had the Jamaican Buffalo wild wings, my wife had the Pan Seared Salmon.","This may go down as one of the worst dining experiences we've been to in a long time.  I originally went with one star. But, I feel it is probably more of a two-star. There are likable things about this place. I'm just at a loss for hone in on what they are.And, honestly, I don't remember the last time I've seen Jayson this unhappy with a dining choice. It's a shame too, I've had this place bookmarked for a while and was excited about finding a new spot in this 'hood. Truth is, we only had oysters and salads. Who screws that up? But, I'd be less than fair if I didn't give half the credit for today's horrible experience to Sam, who gave new meaning to the phrase ""bad waiter.""We literally were one of two tables. At least in Sam's section. When we got there, right after the lunch special stopped, we were the only customer. And Sam, at first, was incredibly hospitable. He was pleasant, funny and very inviting. What went wrong from there is anyone's guess.About 10 minutes after we sat, I ordered a dozen oysters. Then about 15 minutes after that we ordered two Caesar salads and I ordered a French onion soup. It doesn't get more basic than that.Ten more minutes go by and he brings us our salads. I would have appreciated the oysters first. That's why we ordered them immediately. But okay. Not the end of the world. No biggie.That said, the oysters still didn't come out for another 20 minutes, that's more than 30 minutes after we ordered them. It was completely unacceptable, especially since the dining room was empty, except for the second table that had arrived. Maybe this would make sense if we were drinking. But, we don't drink. So, I doubt they were held so I could enjoy my water and Jayson his Sprite. Of course, that got me wondering if this was one of those times that the waiter dismissed us as worthy when we didn't order liquor. I hindsight I wish those oysters never came. They were horrible. First, they weren't cleaned well.  Most of them had crap in them, which is never a good sign. And, not surprisingly, I got sick after, throwing up all night. Now, we would have tried to discuss this with our waiter, but he dispersed, never coming back to us. Never checking in on us. He buzzed around to the other table, but always use the pathway that goes to them, and completely overlook us three tables over.Finally, we asked a woman, who works there, to get our check. And now an hour into this, and still not having gotten my French Onion Soup, we told someone else to cancel the soup. Were they out in the field harvesting the onions and milking the cow for the cheese?Suddenly our MIA waiter appears, with the soup (and a huge attitude) and gets pissed off when we point out that it's been over an hour and we no longer want the soup. At this point, all we want to do is get out of this hell hole. He was like, ""but it's here."" And, we were like, ""but it's been over an hour, and we've been done with everything for 20 minutes.""There was no need for his nasty attitude or dismissiveness. He was even more unprofessional by sending someone else over with our check and going out of his way to continue ignoring us and act like a petulant child. Look, this isn't the worst place in the world, which is why I couldn't leave one star. Our experience was horrible. But, for people who drink, it's probably a half-decent spot. The menu looks like they offer a lot, so there's hope. Would I recommend it? No. Would I actively tell people not to go? No. I'm hoping ours was just a bad experience and not entirely representative of the restaurant as a whole.","First let me start off that we were very skeptical of going into this restaurant but we were seeing a movie across the street. We enter the restaurant and the bartender told us we could sit wherever we wanted. The restaurant was deserted and we soon found out why. Then Sam, our waiter comes over very quickly and it was 4:01pm. The lunch menu ends at 4. We asked if we could still have the lunch menu and he came back with a line of the lunch chef has already put everything away and the dinner chef is the one cooking now. Ummmm. We ordered a dozen oysters (28.95), two side ceasar salads (6.50) and french onion soup. He brought the salads out immediately. But we waited until our oysters came out (15 minutes later) The salads  were drenched with dressing. I was going to say something but he never came back to check on us. I ate maybe 5 bites of salad and I couldn't eat anymore because it was just too soggy. The oysters were disgusting. They had a hard piece of, I want to say gristle, ( that's the best way I can describe it) and they were inedible. Certainly not worthy of the hefty price. Then I saw the bartender and asked for the check. Sam comes over with they french onion soup we had ordered about 20-25 minutes prior. I told him that we didn't want it anymore because it took too long. He looked at me and with a attitude said ""but it has already been made"". I told him that it took too long and if he bothered to check on us he would of known that our entire meal was disgusting. He walks away and a minute or two later he comes back with our check. He just puts it on our tables and walks away. I put our card in it and when he comes back to pick it us still says nothing. He then drops it off and again of a word. I was furious but I just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. We had a horrible experience and I absolutely do not recommend this restaurant. I am a server and I know that you check back on people to see how they are doing, how their food is and if something is wrong on my end, you apologize and try to correct the error. Honestly just go to the movie theater and but popcorn. At least the people are friendly. Thanks Sam for a memorable experience that I hope I can soon forget.","Owned by Jane Austin, Austin Powers, Austin Martin, and Austin Tatious, this is a really cute pub-beer house. They also serve their beers cold, in fact they're served Stone Cold like Steve Austin's.I popped in solely and specifically just to use the bathroom and ended up being spotted by a couple of Yelpy people who recognized me from my Yelp pix - this happens a lot, by the way, even in Manhattan - one of them wasn't even from New York, was in town for a week, but still spotted me - and we ended up having a drink (a quick one, mind you).It's a really nice place although I can't speak to the food, drinks were fine though. Prices weren't cheap, but it's NYC so... I will update this when I get to try the food from here. So a totally unscheduled stop but a really nice place to hang out.",Just came in for a pint of Guinness at the bar.Lots of people having a good time with friends and food and drinks.,This evening my wife and I had the Saurbraten dinner.For the last 2 weeks I have been pestering my wife to come here so that I can try the Oktoberfest menu and have the dinner.Our waiter was very fast and polite.Our food was very well prepared and and it was served piping hot.We had to wait for only a few minutes before our order was served.It was an enjoyable experience.,Austin's Ale House
457,"I tried the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich for the first time yesterday and it was phenomenal. The meat is very tender and the outer batter is crunchy, and I realize this is everything I wanted for a fried chicken sandwich. I'd definitely go back for it sometime.","Let's talk about the Banana Peanut Butter Malted Shake a minute... definitely get that. While I would have liked a bit more flavor or bacon in the Brussel Sprouts, the burger menu was spot on, even the veggie section served variety. If you take my advice though, do the waffle fries! Sorry no photos #starving","Do not order from burger club. My fiancé and I decided to order in on December 14th and their food was careless and sloppy. Their avocado on my ladies burger were brown. My pulled pork pressed sandwich not only didn't have coleslaw on it but it also had a piece of mozzarella cheese the size of a quarter on it. I guess after 8:30, burger club stops caring about their customers.",Always great when eating in. I've tired delivery and it was not good.The burger is always great. Recently tried to chicken burger it was amazing. Some annoying things but still good. There was a lot of fried flour but still a lot of chicken. Maybe take a bit more time to care for making the food. Preferred regular steak fries over waffle fries.Service is quick and everyone was pretty efficient.,Always great when eating in.

I asked for a croquette- madame with challah bread and they gave me a burger bun!!! Absurd that they have challah bread French toast and they dont know what is challah bread besides that. I am extremely displeased.After I got the food and started eating the waitress noticed and she fixed the issue. As I said the service here is great! Not so much the kitchen. To need the wait staff to le them know what is the right bread lol. But still they brought the wrong one but I ate... I was hungry and kot going to send it back again,Burger Club
458,Experience 1. Kindly asked cashier (Short young lady with hat) if I could sample their house coffee before purchasing.Result 1. Cashier said they don't offer samples.Assessment 1. First place to advertise selling coffee that doesn't offer samples. I've been to almost 30 different coffee shops and they allowed me to sample the coffee. This lady was either lying or Indie has poor coffee selling etiquette. Recommendations 1. Offer samples.,"I do have to echo with what a few people said about value/price. Was a little disappointed with how much food came with my soup and half sandwich combo, and I think they can give a little more in terms of portion size. Decor and ambiance is nice and calming. However, I noticed no windows in the seating areas, so the space was filled with cooking fumes. Poor ventilation, made me feel like I was breathing in grease.","Since my initial review, I've ordered many more times and tried more items. I still think the avocado sandwich and kale salad are the best.I didn't care for the roast chicken sandwich, it was too bready. The BLT was ok but was a bit basic and boring. The butternut squash soup with pepitas was good. Little gem salad was lacking the punch that the kale salad has.However, the reason I had to bring them down a star is because the last two times I've gotten the kale salad, they've FORGOTTEN items on it. First it was the pumpkin seeds, today it was the balsamic. Everything needs to be present for this salad to be great. This is disappointing, consistency is the most important aspect of a restaurant. If I can't count on the item to be made properly, I can't keep ordering from there despite how much I love some things.Update 2: I now love the little gem salad too. Those spiced pecans. And I raised my review back to 4 stars because I order from here almost everyday. 3 stars wouldn't be fair.","I love this place. It's great for morning coffee chats, work, breakfast, and yes HAPPY HOUR. I haven't been for happy hour yet but I've heard it's great. For breakfast you need to allow time because they are always pretty busy. I've had the cranberry lunch sandwich, the egg breakfast sandwich, the breakfast panini, and their lattes are amazing.Put this on your LIC list!","I've been living in LIC for a year and today I felt upset I hadn't come here earlier. I got there soon after the opened at 8 am and I ordered the cappuccino and the breakfast egg sandwich - both super delicious! My order was brought to the table within ten minutes of me ordering it. Also the restaurant is super clean, had outdoor seating, and has a really nice aesthetic. Will come here again. The only thing I didn't like was that I sat in their outdoor seating and they decided they wanted to wash their sidewalk and windows right then, which wet me and some of the other customers sitting outside. Why couldn't they do this before opening the restaurant up????","Charming little café in LIC. Great for brunch or lunch but note they get super busy during weekday lunch hour. Espresso drinks are good and the selection of pastries and breakfast items are great. Ask what the daily quiche is, it's always made fresh and it's delicious! I also love the sunny, airy space.",Indie
459,"$32 for a good Japanese breakfast.  $32!!!!!! And I had the Spanish mackerel, which costs less than $10/lb, probably $5-6. So for $32 I got a 4 oz piece of mackerel, a miso soup, rice and a few veggies. A meal that at the same restaurant cost $12 four years ago. It's obscene. I will never go back there again. And anyone that is willing to pay $32 for that breakfast is part of the problem. Gentrification on steroids. A price that only 20% of the neighborhood could even consider.","I want okonomi for breakfast everyday. I think that pretty much sums it up. Other minor details include limited seating, being a bit out of the way in terms of location. And if you're not a fan of rice, seafood and veggies , you probably won't like it too much. I appreciate that the flavors of the food come from the ingredients it self.","This place is apparently one of the famous restaurant all Korean celebrities go to when they come to New York, so my sister and I decided to check this place out. The food was delicately prepared and the server was great in striking up a conversation with us. The place was smaller than what I thought it would be, but it didn't matter. The food portion, when you look at it first, it's not that much. But when you start eating it, you'll realize that it is plenty for a women. I'm not sure about a man.","OKONOMI serves the perfect breakfast.The rice is slightly nutty, every individual grain is cooked to chewy perfection, and the grains stick together just enough to be edible with chopsticks. The bowl is remarkably consistent throughout, with no overcooked or undercooked spots. Mix the onsen egg in for a slightly richer, creamy blend.The rest of the breakfast consists of a slice of fish and a variety of little sides. Each side, from the sweet, light tamago to the greens with mayo and pepper, is a delightful little world of flavor. Both the striped bass and the mackerel are tender and flaky with a subtle marinade and crispy skin.","Honestly, I was disappointed.After an hour wait to get in (they're walk-in only) we were given mostly cold/lukewarm food. Our rice was cold, the egg to put into the rice was cold, and the only thing hot was the soup.The fish was good, but not great. It just tasted like salty fish. No amazing flakiness or special preparation, just lukewarm fish.Did everything taste good? I guess. Was the experience at all what I expected out of a breakfast-warm, filling, tasteful?No. I was really disappointed to wait an hour just to have incredibly bland, cold food. Maybe we just came on an off day but man, for $32 a person I was pretty sad.","Okonomi serves great Japanese breakfast at an expensive price tag. The place has 2 tables for 8 and counter for 4. The place is relatively small, and waiting in line is almost always required (no reservation). Our wait was around 30 minutes. Parking was easy to find on weekend noon.Okonomi serves the traditional Japanese breakfast with two add on options: ikura $6 and poached egg $2.5. The set itself is $32 with a selection between bluefish and swordfish grilled with miso paste. The set also came with a bowl of rice, miso soup, grilled eggplant, corn salad, marinated vege and beans with mustard paste. Although I liked the swordfish over the bluefish, both fish were extremely tender, you will not be disappointed by the flavor, gotta love that miso.We also liked the tamago and eggplant. The tamago was very sweet. Overall the assortment was great seasonal selections. At the price tag, we were very surprised about the portion, yes, very light. Everything was lightly seasoned and cooked, and the poached egg went extremely well with the rice. No doubt the quality of food lived up the standard, but the portion (or price) did not. No tip required, service was great and on par. I would consider it a one time try, no need to return often. Came in with high expectation looking at all the great reviews, results came in lower.food 3.5/5value 2/5ambiance 4/5service 3.5/5",Okonomi
460,I ordered delivery. The food was cooked well and tasted nice. Not too sophisticated but not too basic either. The food came in plastic #5 (polypropylene) containers. The portions were smaller than I expected for this type of restaurant though.,"This place does not make Mexican food. It is people who don't know how to make tacos trying to make Mexican food. Some people may think that this food is tasty, but its basically Chinese food trying to be Mexican food. Some toppings they used like shrimp were chinese style cooked shrimp. The food was't bad, don't get me wrong but I was very disappointed when I tasted my food as I was expecting auethenic Mexican tacos. I would not come back as I can get better tacos from a truck.","This review is for delivery.The food is fine for what it is. But I live in a building and they won't deliver to my floor, their reason is that parking is difficult. If other places said the same thing I would understand but this is the only place who has said that. So I stopped ordering from them.","I was looking for a place to grab tacos after spending the day in corona park and came here after seeing many good reviews. I ordered the supreme chicken quesadilla with chips and salsa. Pros: the cost to food portion ratio was decent. Although, the portions weren't huge, I don't feel that they overcharged as some reviews have stated. The supreme quesadilla  is a step up from a regular quesadilla with the addition of guacamole. I liked the fact that guacamole didn't cost an additional $50 for a small dab.Cons: the guacamole and the salsa didn't have much flavoring. The salsa was more of a thin red tomato sauce that had very little onions in it. The guacamole was definitely missing cilantro, lime and salt resulting in it tasting really bland.Unfortunately, I don't remember how the quesadilla tasted. Overall, for me personally this was just an ok restaurant but I could see how this restaurant can be a go to if you live in the neighborhood. They were fairly busy around lunch time so they're doing something right.","I used ubereats to order my shrimp salad so I can't say much for the inside of the restaurant but I can tell you I cannot wait to order from here again. That salad was one of the most amazing salads I have ever had. It was piled with fresh veggies, grilled veggies like zuchinni and mushrooms, and then perfectly grilled LARGE shrimp. All of the flavors worked so well together and I was so beyond stuffed when I finished it. It was so delicious! I will be back!","During my stay in Queens, I began craving quesadillas so I looked up the nearest spot for a veggie quesadilla. Taco King was not only affordable but it had many options to choose from! I ended up purchasing the black bean taco and the veggie quesadilla. Together it totaled around $7, and it was great for a quick, filling snack. The only downfall about this spot is the lack of credit card machines. That's right folks; Cash Only! Service was great, food was prepared in a timely manner, and the quesadilla and taco were well-seasoned.",Taco King
461,"Has to wait a long while, Rude and border obnoxious,  Bought 4 slices. Expensive fine but it tastes horrible Not my first choice to go to. Definitely last time going.Regret going, hence informing others to not make the same mistake","My food Order got mixed up by delivery boy and my order was sent to the wrong house and being eaten by another person that the delivery guy sent it to. So now I was told by pizzeria that I need to wait for another order to arrive. One hour for initial order, then add another 45mins for backup order.  Almost two hours before I ate it, me and my wife were starving. At least tell me I get 20 percent off my order for the inconvenience. Nothing.","Wasn't as good as we remembered. Sticking to just pizza from now on, which is very good. Oddly crowded in dining room on a weeknight so we sat nearer to pizza area. That was fine. Service was fine. Paninis were not great. Bread a bit hard. Fillings lackluster. Had 3. eggplant, vegetable and mushroom. Nobody liked their pasta dishes. Too al dente and sauce too thin. They don't need to charge restaurant prices for wine in the pizza section. As I said, stick to the pizza it's really good.","Pizza Classica is everything you'd want in your neighborhood Italian spot. It's a family friendly restaurant with your usual Italian entrees. Food is very fresh, hence the longer than usual wait time. (totally worth it)I ordered the Fruta di Mare with squid ink linguine! I requested the squid ink linguine and I was not disappointed. The sea food was soooo darn fresh!! Do yourself a favor and order a seafood dish! Start with the calamari you'll know what I'm talking about it just tastes different.    The servers are very friendly and have a good sense of humor. Our server handled our party of 6 with ease and was very attentive.   The atmosphere is very laid back with the potential to be very classy however it's not treated as a high end Italian restaurant. You can either dress up or bum it out no big deal. 10/10-- will eat here again!",Enjoyed my lunch today at Pizza Classica. Had a Parm chicken with penne and my boyfriend had the shrimp penne vodka. Everything was delicious. Service was amazing. I loved that the waiter gave me fresh shredded basil rather than typical dried crushed; it added the freshness I wanted to my dish. You can order carry out too!,"Great food and excellent service.  Had a quick order of Fruta Di Mare, slice of Caesar pizza and Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza (all our favorites).  There must have been a little misunderstanding on my order (as I was outside and stuck in traffic when I called) but Audrey was just really nice to fix it all up for me.  We keep coming back here for years now coz food is really, really good! And their service is really warm, just like home.",Pizza Classica
462,"I enjoyed the bread, meat, and peppers, but the salad was disappointing and nothing special. The real issue I had was they did not provide any water at all.",Loveee this place. We always come back for borek and meat!! Deserts are a must as well.,"Worker tried to flirt with my father, was very disrespectful. The salad was rotten, horrible service in total. I do not recommend this eatery, unless you want to get hit on or to get sick.","Cevabdzinica Sarajevo is a tasty Bosnian restaurant.  The service definitely wasn't friendly, and was only borderline polite, but it was certainly efficient.  I placed my order at the counter for a plate of cevapi and less than 10 minutes later it was brought to my table.  The ambiance is relaxing and nicely adorned with kitsch Balkan decorations.  There was a TV playing (presumably Bosnian) music videos during lunch time.The cevapi was delicious.  It was served with the traditional raw white onions, ajvar and chewy bread.  I needed some more ajvar during my meal and fortunately for me they had mini plastic cups of it in one of their fridges, which the female employee pointed for me to grab myself.  I will definitely be back.","The number of Croatians and Bosnians in the Astoria / LIC area has always been significant, but amidst all the businesses catering to the Balkan community, Cevabdzinica Sarajevo has somehow remained the most well known of them all. The place is tiny, with just enough tables for lunch dates and solo dining. The interior is dated as well, but I think that just adds more charm of the place. While big group dining is possible, it would be recommended to that party to 4 max.Many folks are coming here for the cevapi, a balkan grilled minced meat, which has been the restaurant's claim to fame. It is after all, the national dish of several countries (#1) and where better than to get them in Queens? Typically they're served with a flatbread and a pile of onions, feta cheese, sour cream, and some other condiments. The cevapi here I believe is Bosnian based, hence the use of the beef. The bottom line? It's really tasty and I highly recommend it.But as they say with most good restaurants, that's not the only thing. I love their sarma, which is stuffed cabbage and it comes with lots of sauce and potatoes. Whenever they bring a fresh burek (stuffed with anything), I have to have it. I would also say that the mixed grill for 2 is a good value for major meat lovers and any of their kebabs (especially the chicken) is excellent. Don't sleep on the gulash either, the beef stew really comes through. (#2)The guys running the show are super nice. They're not the best on the phone but are generally quite friendly. Prices are a little steep for the amount of food one gets, but this is LIC. I wish there were more places like this, but beggers can't be choosers. I'll continue to give Cevabdzinica Sarajevo my money and my appetite._____________(#1) Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia(#2) Another unintentional rhyme.","Seems like a cozy family restaurant I went here to try their Cevapi again after a friend introduced me to it & it did not disappoint! Very tasty the only complaint I have is that I wish it was a bigger portion for price ( it is 8$ instead of 6$ that it says on the website) But overall i really enjoyed it , once you mix alm the ingredients together in the cevapi it really meshes well! Alot of flavor , i need to try their baklava next!",Cevabdzinica Sarajevo

This is where he comes to pick up creature comforts like Barry's, Custard Creams, Roses, Mi Wadi, etc! I even turned my Chinese mom into a Flahavans fan and realized I created a conundrum for myself as this is extremely difficult to find apparently, hah. I love international supermarkets (I myself am a huge fan of potato waffles, pot noodles, Penguins, and Ballymalloe tomato jam) and since its expansion, Butcher Block got even better! Only callouts would be that they don't seem to carry wine gums and even their local products are overpriced (ie meat and produce).",On weekends I love stopping by with here for a meal that will put me into a food coma.Roast beef with double portion of side of mashed potato+gravey.

464,Everything just GREASY and no flavor. I ordered A steak and avocado salad it's all over with Olive oil like it's flooded. No flavor only grease and sour and must be really cheap olive oil because the taste it almost like vegetable oil. The beef is no flavor the way they grill it's medium rare juicy I gave a thumb up for that and good sangria that's all.NEVER EVER STEP IN HERE again. If you really want steak go to Peter Luger or Porter house even Boca junior on Queens Blvd.,"Been to La Fusta a few times due to recommendations from friends, but I am not a huge fan ... sorry, not sorry. I've tried their Tilapia Francese, steak, spinach side, and a number of appetizers and salads. Unfortunately, nothing really wowed me. I thought 80% of the food were too salty and our steak was pretty overdone. Meh...","The parking gods were on our side as we struggled a bit to find their private lot, my dining partner isn't super with directions.Once we sat, our waiter of seventeen years, since the business inception greeted us with a kind smile. Each ordering the Small Skirt Steak with shareable sides of Avacado Salad & Shrimp, spinach, broccoli and mashed potatoes, the meal came to us quickly, as did my warm Negro Modello. Warm dark beer just has no place especially sitting next to what appeared to be a great steak.The Avacado Salad was fifteen dollars --- maybe one Avacado and maybe four shrimp -- it was a unfair price for such a pitifully poor appetizer.My medium rare cook temp came out more like Pittsburgh -- or Black and Blue if you prefer upon the very first cut, clearly an error. I made no noticeable quark and cut thinner slices as the meat was tougher than I would have thought and I'd still be there chewing if not for matchboom sized incisions-- it was an unfortunate surprise. The sides were really terrible, definate frozen broccoli, most likely frozen spinach and definitely -- instant mashed potatoes. The sign of a once great restaurant that now has the name and the customer base to take shortcuts and maximize profits. So sad was I after being so excited walking in, hearing all the positive experienced -- a terrible failure across the board I am pained to report.","So our favorite steakhouse closed recently and my wife and I have been looking for a ""replacement"" place. My wife had heard about this place thru some co workers so we decided to give it a try. Parking is mostly metered but there might street parking on the side streets but this place is already on a side street. We went on a Monday early evening and we were lucky enough to find a metered spot right away. The restaurant itself is quaint but decent sized. Two seating sections and they have a bar as well. There's a big flat screen in the main dining area where we sat. I didn't get a look at the other section which was separated by a half wall. Being a Monday night it wasn't busy and we were able to pick our own table which is nice. Service was good and they start you off with some chimi churri sauce and bread. We got a salad for both of us as an appetizer and we both also had the small skirt steak. Both were very good. The steak as actually decent sized for the small one and it was pretty good. We'll definitely be back. I want to try the mixed grill plates here.","I thought that one of my friends had recommended this place to me, but it was my imagination. It was a happy accident. The food is terrific. You start off with some warm bread and herby chimichurri. We ordered the Sangria pitcher and a Margarita. I'm sure that their website says that their Margaritas are famous all over town, but that Sangria was the one that you want to get. It's overloaded with fruits that complement amazingly well with the red wine. It's sweet, but not artificially or overly so. You can finish it easily, and have the fruits left over for dessert.I got the Large Argentinian Grill with the Chorizo, Morcilla, Tira De Asado, Molleja, Chinchulin and Entraña- a sample of most grill items. The chorizo was pretty salty, which was to be expected, but the morcilla(Blood sausage) was surprising also salty. The spices of the morcilla were definitely unique and nicely pungent, though. The rest of the meats were just a tad over cooked(past medium when medium rare was requested), but still tasted fairly good. The char from the grill was easily recognized, covering at least half of each piece, which could either be a good or bad thing, depending on your taste. If you're getting sides, skip the French Fries Provenzal, even though it's the most expensive one. They're thin fries topped with small bits of garlic that don't really disseminate or bring much flavour to the fries. Mashed Potatoes were standard.The real star of the meal, however, was the Family-sized Shrimp and Avocado Salad. The shrimp was fresh and plump, with the avocado to act as somewhat of a sauce to combine the two together. Onions, watercress, and a delicious vinaigrette to cut through the fattiness of the avocado. Food was great, parking was free(which is usually a terrible hassle for me when in Elmhurst), waiters were polite and accommodating, and live music with an old-school environment with random photos hanging on the walls. It's a great place to check out. Just save it for occasions, because this place is not at all cheap.",If you're looking for a great steak dinner in queens La fusta is the place. It's a small place but with big character and it is well loved by everyone in the neighborhood. Everything is delicious here but I particularly love their skirt steak with roasted pepper and chimichurri along with their truffle fries. Let's not even get into the complimentary warm bread and chimichurri before your food arrives .... so amazing ... if they would bottle and sell their chimichurri they would have a lifelong customer in me. Totally worth the trip to queens . Check it out !,La Fusta Restaurant
465,"Authentic Greek cuisine in a setting that takes me back to greece.Jealous that I dont live in ny, because this is how yiayia makes food.",It doesn't get better than this. The food is consistently good over the many meals enjoyed there over the last decade plus. The management is fantastic. Staff is attentive but not overbearing. Also very thoughtful and accommodating. There is no better Greek food in Astoria. Very cozy atmosphere.,"It may be winter but wear a tank top!! This restaurant gets hot!!! Like uncomfortably warm and I'm a person who runs cold. Overall the servers were polite and took food allergies at the table seriously. My experience of the food was that is was good but not great. I would have liked a little more seasoning/flavor in just about everything we tried and we ate our way thorough the menu. We were in a group of about 10 and one person's food took much longer to come out  than everybody else's so that was also disappointing. Overall, a solid choice in the neighborhood but not something I 'd seek out.","After starting the summer in Greece, I needed to end the summer there too (somehow). On a Thursday afternoon during a 'sick day' from work I decided to come here for lunch. My typical meal for lunch (and almost every meal) was Grilled Octopus, Greek Salad and sometimes those amazing olive oil and lemon potatoes...oh and a bottle of wine. So I decided I needed to have that here to feed my nostalgia and depression.I sat outside and was taken care of by a very sweet server that definitely embodied the Greek hospitality that I missed so much. My date and I got a large Greek salad to start,tzatziki, and two octopus and a side of potatoes and a bottle of Santorini wine. Everything came out in a timely manner, the octopus was perfectly cooked and the salad and tzatziki was perfect...only complaint was the potatoes were a little over cooked and mushy but I still enjoyed them. Definitely will be back to get my Greek fix","One of the most Authentic Greek restaurants I've ever experienced in NYC big competitor of Taverna Kyclades on the same blvd.I had the pleasure of having one of the most amazing outdoor dinners before summer is over. Agnanti has outdoor table seating, some are very small which was where we were seated, we had to rush eat our food because we ordered a lot and there wasn't enough space for other dishes. Presentation wise as you can tell they dishes have a nice presentation. wait staff was very professional and welcoming, loved the smiles. The Shrimp Kaitifi was one of my favorite dishes there, nice appetizer to share, the mustard sauce gave a terrific touch to the Shrimp which was wrapped in Kaitifi. The Bacalao croquettes Over the yummy spread were also a good choice. Fries whitings were very tasteful, fries perfectly and crunchy on the outside just how I like it. We also tried the Stuffed Calamari and the Agnanti Wraps for appetizers, must try absolutely both of them, the Grilled calamari had such an amazing mix seafood stuffing that left us wanting more. The Agnanti wraps were also a great call, when you hear wrap you'd think of an actual wrap but ""no"" this is fried phyllo stuffed with feta cheese and chopped bacon. *Party In My Mouth* the flavor combination between the feta and the bacon was just perfect. In the end they brought us dessert on the house which was very nice of them. They don't really have a dessert menu or it doesn't seem like they carry a variety of desserts so they just brought a plate with two walnut cookies and yogurt with cherry which was very light. Overall my experience here was great. Unfortunate we were a little disappointed about the table we were sitting at which seemed a little cafe style table and very small. I'd definitely return here to try other dishes.","Aynanti is a great traditional Greek restaurant for seafood. Small place with outdoor seating and an efficient staff. Must try their Greek salad, grilled octopus, grilled Salmon and whatever their fish of the day is. Decorated with potted plants and pictures of famous Greeks and old street signs from the old country. They bring the taste and feel of a Greek taverna just as well as anyone else in Astoria.",Agnanti
466,Very authentic Italian cruising go during weekday they have prefix dinner menu for a very good price.,"the noise level with 2 tables at 5:15pm was beyond outrageous. you couldn't even hear Sinatra music in the background. somehow the acoustics in this place is beyond horrific ! the food was very mediocre. I'm afraid to say, I came here for the memory at a friend's request whom I was with, as we both had growing up years in Le Havre. I will never return. Also, the bread basket was very inferior. it wasn't semolina bread, garlic bread, or even italian bread. not sure, but one taste, and i was totally turned off.","Had my moms 60th birthday dinner here and nothing my amazing reviews from everyone at our table. We bad 14 people and they did nothing but rave about the food. The price for the prefix menu wasn't bad at all- it includes wine, beer and soda along with hot antipast, a pasta course, salad, and a main meal and last but not least a birthday cake. The hot antipast platter was very delicious and over flowing with enough of food for everyone.I personally had the penne ala vodka and chicken franches and it was delicious! The service was amazing as well!","Always a great meal here. This was my family's go-to place for dinners and special occasions.We try and go weekly to see Danny. His staff is always friendly with top notch service.Last night we were 3- shared the Artichoke and Baked Clams. Couldn't stop dipping the bread in that yummy garlicky sauce.I had Grilled Pork Chops in a Mushroom Marsala sauce, oAnd the boys had Veal Marsala and Mahi Mahi with clams and mussels.All excellent. Do take advantage of the Early Bird Specials when you can. Why cook????","A nice little casual local eatery with good food, good service and good prices.  Riviera Ristorante has been around forever, or at least close to it.  It's an old-school Italian eatery probably more so than Italian and then north in Italian but who cares when the food is good and plentiful. The service is good and the wait staff are helpful.  As I said earlier the restaurant has been around forever and could use a bit of a refreshing but it's kind of fun and funky because it's old style in all these ways.  It is hustling bustling and loud on a Friday night and Saturday night but I guess that's to be expected.","Dinner at Riviera tonight. The best! That's all I can say. The best food, the best service.  Riviera Ristorante is so amazing that my kids made it their ""go to place"" with their girlfriends and also when it's guys night out. Their friends love this place so much that now it's their ""go to place"" with their girlfriends and family . That speaks for itself. If you want a delicious meal every time,  go to Riviera. I suggest reservations on the weekend as it is always packed! If it wasn't good , it wouldn't be packed. Prices are excellent & portions are big. Go hungry, leave happy!",Riviera Ristorante
467,"Came in here cuz the nice lady greeted us by the door. Service is nice, but the food here is far beyond edible! Their appetizers weren't any good at all, including their kimchi! Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish and I don't know how they fail that. All the appetizer was just too salty. My sad soondubu was diluted and tasted very bland. My mom ordered their beef stew noodle and it came out completely bland and the waitress told us to add salt on our own. If that was the case, my mom might as well just boil water and noodle at home. My toddler egg fried rice was so oily. I felt sick eating it.","I wish I could give this four stars because I did enjoy my time overall and the waitresses took care of us. But I was really disappointed by the marinated galbi portion for its $38 price point and the beef soup that we got was not very good. It tasted like kimchi water with sausage.Another con is that they won't let you grill the meet unless you order more than one portion of meat, which kind of sucks.","The seafood pancake has no seafood inside at all.... very disappointing. Do not order it.. a waste of money. Otherwise, the pork bbq was good.","If you love bbq pork, then this is the place for you! The quality of the pork belly + joule is great compared to other Korean bbq spots. Not too fatty but enough fat ratio with the pork. Highly recommend!","Pretty good Korean BBQ place located in a relatively tranquil part of Flushing. I was even able to find street parking nearby. Upon arrival and sitting down, other than the cool breeze from the open door, we noticed they use a tilted crystal slabs for grilling. The icy jug of barley tea was a nice touch. The kalbi was pretty good. Tender and delicious as it should be at a good kbbq restaurant. Pretty standard pricing for NY/NJ at $34.95 per order. More off the beaten path we had an order of thinly sliced grilled duck - ori dae pae for $22.95. It was delicious especially when eaten with grilled kimchi or wrapped in lettuce with soy bean paste and powder and pickled turnip. Also pretty good and standard was the naeng myun cold buckwheat noodles. It was $10.95. Good broth flavor and elasticity of the noodles. We didn't have a chance to try Hanjoo's specialty, the grilled pork belly, unfortunately.",Food: 3.5/5Stopped by for naengmyun and duck. First time having duck here and I understand the hype now! It's super soft and full of flavor. It sort of reminded me of thin sliced pork belly. Might be the best Korean spot for duck that's I've tried so far.The naengmyun was just average. I think the spot down the street serves better cold noodles. The broth tasted watered down imo. Not sure if it's because of all the melted ice but it lacked depth. Definitely get the duck!Service: 4/5The ladies here are so nice and accommodating.Ambiance: 3/5Typical Kbbq interior. Nothing special.,Han Joo Chik Naeng Myun & BBQ
468,"A friend and I went there during their Taco Tuesdays (an order of taco is $5 for 2 tacos), which tasted fine. The margaritas were good as well. There was an error with the payment, and we sent the check back, and it was taken care of. When it came to tipping, we wanted to give a 18% in cash, but was a little short, so we used the coins we had to make it to the 18%. The manager came and told us that they do not accept coins, and had a nasty attitude towards us.The food and drinks were decent, but that attitude from the manager ruined our whole night. Money is money, it shouldn't matter in which form it is given. Will not be going back; there are plenty of other restaurants in the block.","Lacking Customer Service and responsiveness. Even for regulars like ourselves the lack of attention was just disappointing. They should send the manager (short bald guy) and the wait staff down the block and take lessons from the staff at Avli.We came in they sat us promptly and 4 minutes later we had our drinks. The place was packed and service on point. Sangarita's you should learn to take care of your regulars. It's not okay to have your customers wait 15 for a beer even if you're busy, which you weren't. And it's furthermore disappointing that the short bald guy let us leave and cancel the order over a beer. You should take care of your clientele and more so your repeat customer base. Just disappointing.",Food and drinks are great but the balding older bartender definitely just referred to our table of asians by pulling his eyes to the side. Racist much?,"Let's say that Sangarita is an awesome option for after work drinks and tapas. It was my cuz birthday and since I brought him here before, he remembered the happy hour discounts we got the last time. The seem to be known in the area for sangrias.  They have a few sangria options to choose from. They have generous pours also. If there is any other place with sangrias, I would not bother with other places. For me Sangarita is the best option. We placed an order for gambas al ajillo, which is shrimps cooked in oil and garlic which is one of my favorites.  We liked it so much that we ordered a second platter of that. It also comes with fresh sliced hero bread that you can dip with the garlic flavor...omg so good!We decided to stay at the bar and a very nice young took care of us, then the manager took care of us. Both are so friendly and conversational. They do not overtake the conversation but it was good to have insight into the business.  We also ordered the chimi sliders after a second round of a different sangria, the white peach! I was amazed at the flavor.  We did have a concern for 1 dish we ordered,  we kindly presented our concern and the manager immediately took it off. That shows me how customer centric they are. They definitely will be seeing us again soon.",After seeing the yelp review scores go up to 4 stairs with some 200 reviews we decided to revisit Sangarita. We came here mostly for drinks after a hard week's work and we had a blast. The bartender was on point with the passion fruit mojitos and I love going to a place that mimics some of my YouTube playlist. The waiter was a  hilarious little columbian dude ....he was great! He definitely enhanced the overall experience. The support staff were very attentive as well. The tapa style dishes were the perfect complement to a typical Friday happy hour after work drinks. Kudos to the management I feel this place has really upped their game.,Love this new spot! We only went in for a light meal but everything we got from the tacos to the calarmari and hummus was fantastic! And the manager gave us a coupon for a free sangria next time we come! Either way the service was great and the food was excellent. We will definitely be back!,Sangarita's
469,"It's great in the sense that it's super close to school and is really cheap, but unfortunately that's about it. The selection here is pretty extensive and even includes a French toast bagel (which was unfortunately appalling) and lots of other breakfast items. Considering I got a lox bagel for less than $10 with a more than adequate amount of lox in it, I might be harsh with a 2 star rating. However, if the price point is the only thing a place has going for it, it probably isn't worth it.First, the lox was just off. It didn't taste like it had gone bad or anything of that sort, it just didn't taste how lox is supposed to taste. Lox isn't cheap, everyone knows that. But it's not meant to be. I would rather opt for a $15 bagel from Russ and Daughters any day versus a $8.50 bagel from here. Real lox should melt in your mouth, and this one was chewy and unsatisfying. On top of that, my bagel wasn't toasted either. And yes, I did ask for it toasted (who doesn't eat a bagel toasted)? Adding on to the dislike of bagels here- the French toast bagel sealed the deal for me. Please, can someone explain to me why in the world a bagel should be sticky? I get it, it's ""French Toast"" but that doesn't mean that a bagel should be smothered in syrup. I had high hopes when I saw that they carried them here as the bagel shop near me (Hand Rolled Bagels) doesn't have them regularly (only as a flavor of the month on occasion). Maybe Hand Rolled raises the standards too high on a French Toast bagel for me, but this was just a major miss. Sticky, tough to chew, and, most importantly, didn't even really resemble French Toast. I wouldn't come back here as the only redeeming quality about this place is the price point- but let's just say their price point is low for a reason.","I've been coming to this bagel place for 10 years now and the food is consistently amazing.  My tastes have changed over the years and I've ordered probably everything on the menu.   I would have easily given 5 stars but unfortunately the service isn't as consistently good as the quality of food.   I've learned to be very specific about my order and even go over it with them before they start putting everything together but even with doing that I've left with incorrect orders multiple times and for the fact that I live in manhattan and don't get to come here often 2 out of 2 times I've ordered in the last week while visiting family in bayside my order was mixed up/ not as requested.  If orders were taken with a little more attention to detail I'd have no complaints at all.  All in all I will be back,  my favorite bagel place in ny.","We come here almost every weekend to pick up bagels and egg salad. This morning I picked up an egg salad, my wife ate some noticing it tasted funny, then I put half of it on my bagel, tasted it, and it was bad. Brought it back and the guy in the back tells me ""next time don't eat half of it"". I wouldn't say putting egg salad on a bagel and throwing it out ""eating it"". Actually, they not only owed me for the egg salad, they owed me for a ruined bagel. The comment was rude and unnecessary and I had to go out of my way to come back and get my money back. No one is trying to ""get over"" on an egg salad. Next time shut up and eat the 50 cent loss for your business instead of trying to prove some point.","Shoutout to the lady today who fulfilled my ""Extra cream cheese"" request that prompted me to write this!!!!!The first time I had Bagel Oasis was in 2011. Since then, it has been my first stop from the airport whenever I visit NY.  Their nova spread is amazing, the salmon cream cheese is a little fishier, tofu cream cheese tastes freakn vegan-friendly amazing but my all time favourite will forever and always be Bacon Scallion on Everything bagel, toasted with cheese, onion and tomato. That said!!! the amount of cream cheese they add has definitely decreased since a few years ago. plus the server is different every time so their bagels are always inconsistent. I dont want to say they skimp out but I am so passionate about their cream cheese that my mood of the day literally depends on the amount of spread I find when i dig into the brown paper bag and unwrap my bagel. Back in the days I would get the same guy every time and he'd know my order as soon as I walked in. the amount cream cheese was absolutely ridiculous and i loved every second of it, now its a hit or miss, kind of like bagel roulette.Bottom line, i love this place so much i can write a thesis on their bagels. please do yourself a favour and get yourself a bagel right. now. they're open :)","Normal bagel business, extra cool because they're open 24/7 but I've never visited late so whatever. Typically I'll come through in the mid-AM for bagels. Sometimes I just get the bagels, take them home, toast and cream cheese to my heart's content. Other times, I order them toasted, with cream cheese. Yesterday, I had a toasted bagel with cream cheese and nova. Lots of cream cheese, not enough salmon. Again, whatever.They seem to be pretty quick, which is a plus. IDK, give it a shot. YOLO.","Bagel Oasis is one of my top three favorite bagel shops. My family and I have been coming to this shop for over twenty years. They are conveniently open 24/7.  This place has been a lifesaver in the past when I've had to order bagels during the wee hours for an event or just when I was craving it. They are located right next to the bus stop on the LIE service road.  Don't worry about the lines during the morning rush.  They always have a lot of staff working behind the counter. As soon as you come in, someone will greet you and take your order.I love that they still make their bagels onsite--you'll always be guaranteed a fresh bagel.  If you're lucky, you'll get a bagel that literally just came out of the oven.  I think in the past I've also tried some of the other items on their menu like their sandwiches and muffins.  I'm sure they were good but this place is known for their bagels.  It's what they do best.  The bagels are always delicious with a crunchy exterior and chewy middle.  For $12.50 you get a free container of cream cheese with an order of a dozen bagels on Mon-Wed.  What a bargain!  They have other bagel specials on the menu.  They offer 3 or 4 different bagels specials. This place is a must try if you've never had it.",Bagel Oasis
470,"Skip this spot if you can. I placed an order for a slice of blueberry pie and a slice of chocolate cake. We called an hour after our order was placed and they said that it would be there soon. When the order got here, we realized they sent apple pie. The person who ordered the pie is allergic to apples. We called again and they told us that they ran out of pie so they just sent a different kind (without calling us??) At this point we were annoyed, but they sent out a different type of cake. Then I bit into the chocolate cake....and it was full of egg shells. This is disgusting. What do you have, a 5 year old baking in the back? When I called for a refund they said I had to go to seamless-which I did. But this is a health hazard.","I went here with my gf while we waited for her brother to land at Laguardia. We ordered Chicken soup and mozzerella sticks to start. Both ok, nothing special. For dinner, i got the burger and she got the chicken fingers. The chicken fingers were bland. This is where it gets gross. I took the first bite out of my burger and there was a folded up and used CLOROX WIPE between the burger and the bun. Absolutely disgusting. I told my waiter, who was really attentive and friendly, and he brought it to the back to make a new one. Another waiter came over and tried to tell me it was the wax paper that they use to put the burger on the grill, but I knew it was a clorox wipe. It was huge and moist. Really disgusting. i don't know who the manager was, there was an older woman and man who looked like maybe they were managing, but never once did a manager come up to us to apologize or see how we were doing. The women who rang us up didn't mention it or say anything, she was quite rude actually. This is the absolute worst part. THEY CHARGED US FULL PRICE FOR THE BURGER AND ENTIRE CHECK! I'd of made more of a stink but we had been waiting for 3 hours for her brother and I just wanted to get the hell out of this place. Poor customer service. If I lived in the area, I'd never come back.","The food was  mediocre ,but what got me so disgusted was that there was a dead squashed fly on the window ,on top of that a dead cockroach under my seat ....the manager had to come and do the cleaning because the Service didn't want to do it ,they should send the health department here to check them out ! Never again ! Then I paid so much for this place .","You just can't go wrong with Greek owned New York City diners.There's always tasty and various specials daily. Yes, you can always grab affordable and genuine New York City style/deli style breakfast as well as Burgers and fries with variations that accommodate today's trends.The service is always what you expect from a diner, as good as it gets, and you can always expect a full bar to quench whatever alcoholic thirst you're feeling at the moment.","This review is for the food. Service was alright. Ordered lobster and steak.  Lobster was way over cooked and hard. Steak was ordered medium rare, came almost well done. The soup was the only thing that was ok, and even that came with crackers that were stale. The spinach was extremely bland.","Large portions, tasty omelets, friendly service.  In fact she was so super friendly that I was willing to overlook the fact she brought things I specifically didn't order (toast, potatoes) or didn't bring something right away I did order (sour cream). Obviously being nice goes a long, long way.  Located near LaGuardia Airport which is how I wound up there.  excellent choice!!!",Buccaneer Diner
471,"I ordered through the Yelp app and the process was nice and smooth. The food was delivered very fast. I received a call from a person who didn't speak English-from a # that was from Washington State. Very strange. I got the delivery because it was delivered to the main desk of where I work. I'm not sure if the business, or grub hub is responsible for the delivery communication issues, but that's not cool at all. So after all that the food was good. Not great. I'm not sure if I would order from them again. I may try and go to the place, but I'm not rushing to do so.",One of my favorite spots. Everything has been tasty but parking in the area is tough.,"Loved the 'Dominican style' patacones!! This one had fried salami and fried cheese in it. Didn't like the Cachapas much, but the patacones we're on point!","This place is so cool!  I had never done the Venezuelan sandwich thing before so I don't know if this is the best example of the style, but it's real real good!  And cheap!Had a pork patacone and a fried cheese chachapa and they were both great.  The chachapas are more my style.  The house mayo is kinda sweet and tangy so there's a sweet/salty thing going on.Plan to go back to try the burger--looks nuts","Food was AMAZING! First time ordering here on Grubhub and wasn't disappointed at all. I didn't know what to get so I grabbed a few little things to share. I had the pastelitos with beef, a chicken empanada, a Patacon with Perñil and the fried cheese-stick and Tres Leche. The Chicken empanada is one I don't recommend. Both my hubby and I agreed that it taste like fish. I don't know what's up with that. Aside that, the Perñil patacon was delicious and huge, I opted not to have mayo or ketchup on it because I didn't want it soggy when arriving and I regret that because it was sorta dry lol. I added all the sauces that was provided to me though and it was so GREAT! The fried cheese stick was also very good and the beef pastelitos was so cute and small but filling and absolutely delicious! Tres leche was so mouth watering and good. I'm definitely eating here again, it was sooo worth it. The best $20 ever spent in a long time.","The Roast Pork Patacon was absolutely amazing! I have to give it tothem, they really managed to have a very nice space, good ambiance,incredibly friendly staff and a high-quality menu that is OUT OF THISWORLD. I had the Roast Pork Patacon but every other meal looked justas great. I could see that everyone in the room was enjoying theirfood. It was a very nice experience eating here, I highly recommendthem!",Cachapas y Mas
472,If you want to be a baller on a budget go here for a Faux-Go de Chao menu but on a Texas Roadhouse budget. All of their grilled meats are delicious so no need for me to suggest anything to you.,"The meat server here is an absolute jerk. On a friend's recommendation, I trekked all the way here from Manhattan. I approached the meat server and asked him if he had any rare cuts. He said ""No,"" and showed me a well-done piece of flank steak. I inquired if he had anything else that was rare. He told me ""No,"" and again showed me the well-done piece of flank steak. ""This is all I have,"" he advised. I asked him if he would have any rare cuts later that evening. He insisted ""No,"" then walked away from me. ...upon which I left the restaurant. Don't mess with this place. Best to go to Villa Brasil on 34th Avenue, Astoria. Ask for Carlos.","Super unimpressed. Had never been before and was sat by a waiter but not told anything. How would we know what to do? The owner or manager saw our confused faces and came over and explained, thankfully. We got the food - hot buffet. It was all okay - nothing amazing. Steak and chicken sausage was fine but not great. Wouldn't go back.",Solid spot - my meal could easily have been double in NYC. Meat is juicy. Loved the vegetables as well. Ambiance is nice and the place is clean. Service was attentive.,"Yummm, love this (relatively) new addition to Ditmars. Weigh by the pound style Brazilian buffet with a salad bar, hot bar and rotisserie station. The interior is super cute, lots of wall art and a beautiful bar. When the weather is nice, they even have a few tables on the sidewalk. I imagine the hot bar/rotisserie items are on a rotating basis. There is a board with the meat selection of the day. I had paella, veggies, plantains and some kind of salmon from the hot bar. Salmon and plantains were delicious, the octopus in the paella was a little rubbery. From the rotisserie I had chicken hearts, sirloin with garlic and pork sausage. The sirloin was flavorful and on the fatty side, which I loved. Chicken hearts and sausage were great too. My boyfriend had the beef ribs and they were a little tougher. We had mango and lime caipirinhas - they were STRONG. Overall, great experience. Drinks are a little pricey but food is super well priced. Waiters were helpful but guy at rotisserie wasn't the nicest.","Price per pound Brazilian buffet I love it! Great selection of lip smacking dishes from the cold and hot bar. Love the name of this place since I know one Kilogram in the metric system is equivalent to 2.2 pounds. It's quite easy to fill up your plate with that much food since it's so good. The selection of churrascaria is pretty sweet and since you pay per the pound you are in complete control, the more you pile on the more you pay. I dislike flat rate AYCE buffets where some people stack their plates to the top and end up throwing most of it away. Listen all you AYCE foodies out there, you can make more than one trip to the buffet line, please dont waste food! Sorry, I had to vent.Dining here is easy, pick up a plate and survey the food bar. The day I went they had paella, shrimp in gravy, pernil, sausage, oxtail, plantains, yucca, chicken lasagna, beans and a few other goodies. The carving station had all the usual churrascaria items you would find in a Brazilian steakhouse. I had the lamb and skirt steak.After you completed filling your plate they will weigh your food and bill you after you finished eating. They have a pretty decent amount of adult beverages to choose from and a open bar as well. The food is seasoned well and the best part of the whole experience is the meats are cooked perfectly. They will carve as much or as little as you like on to your plate. Definitely worth the price as other speciality supermarkets and delis charge pretty much the same per pound for lack luster food. Once you try Kilo's you'll be hooked and leave there a kilo or two heavier.",Kilo Astoria
473,"Wouldn't recommend. No hosted or wait staff, just sat myself at sushi bar. Sushi bar did not look fresh, had flies buzzing around and the guy was cleaning w bleach behind the counter which was over powering.  Spider roll was just ok. Shumai was eh and fishy tasting. The gyoza came all burnt w the burnt part attached, horrible presentation- didn't even eat them.  Service was ok.","Solid Japanese spot in LIC!We stopped by on Friday around 8 pm and we got seated quickly. Will def come back!Pro- grilled octopus was so well cooked! Perfect marination- their katsu was so crispy on the outside and soft on the inside- get the bento! Its so worth it- saw a great cocktail list (never got to try it, but looked lovely)- average rolls, but there were a lot of varietyCon- their karage was different, and wasn't a huge fan of it :(","Day/Time: Monday, around 12:30pm.Wait Time: No wait time.

Drinks: Didn't order any drinks. Food: I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box which came with miso soup. To be honest, food is just average/mediocre for the price. It's decent, but not great.

But I wouldn't go out of my way.","My go to sushi place in the neighborhood!I think this place is super cute and the workers have always been pleasant.My friend and I ordered ended up ordering take out , we got the flash roll, the Medusa, and the Kani salad.The flash roll is delicious, the flavors just come together so well, it's definitely one to try.The Medusa roll was interesting. We wanted to try something new and realized this was not for us. The melted mozzarella on top takes away from the roll, and it just wasn't a good combo for us.The Kani salad is a great side, it's usual standard.","Was walking past with the wife the other day when we peeked in the window and decided that Japanese sounded like a good idea for dinner. Of course, before we went in I had to reach into my pants and pull out my giant....Samsung Note 8 to check Yelp and see the reviews. I usually agree with my fellow Yelpers, but I felt this was a little lower than I had expected.We started with the shishito peppers, which I will say were straight-up probably the best shishito peppers I've ever had. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, they were awesome. This was followed-up by the gyoza...we had one pork and one veggie. They were a mixed bag. The pork gyoza was great, the veggie gyoza were pretty bland.For the main, we split some Yakitori ..again, a mixed bag. The corn and bacon/asparagus were absolutely delicious. I wish I could have made a meal out of these, and I would have walked out pretty happy. However, I got the Wagyu beef yakitori as well...while it was perfectly cooked and delicious, it was also room temperature, which was strange given that the other skewers were hot.We had also ordered a spicy tuna roll.  After finishing the skewers, I found it strange that we were sitting there for 10 minutes and they hadn't brought the roll out yet. I grabbed the server's attention and asked if he had gotten the spicy tuna roll in the system and he said yes, it should be right out. It was close to another 10 minutes before we finally got it. I suspect he probably forgot to put the order in until I asked for it. Either that, or that was one meticulously-crafted tuna roll. The roll itself was pretty bland though...I was not impressed with the sushi at all.All-in-all, not a terrible place, decent prices, but very mediocre overall. There were some standouts that were great, but also some things that were below-par. There's too much good Japanese in the city to get stuck with just 'average,' sorry guys!",Great sushi spot. The rolls are large and fresh.  The service is excellent.  They have a great happy hour. And it's one of the only spots to watch sports in the area.  My favorite roll is the tuna loco by far. You also have to try the thunderdome it is awesome. It's basically tuna and salmon cubes wrapped in avocado it is very very good I highly recommend. I have been here a few times and will continue to go back as it has yet to disappoint.,Sapps
474,"Friends and I came on a Saturday night thinking they would serve Korean style friend chicken. It is more of an American style heavily battered chicken. We ordered a Korean style pancake first and it came out overly fried and heavy unlike the light crispy texture a Korean Style pancake should have.As for the chicken, the batter was so heavy, it double the size of the chicken and towards the end we started peeling off the fried batter just to get to the chicken. The chicken came with different sauces we had originally assumed would be integrated as part of the batter similarly to Korean Style chicken. It came out as a more dipping sauce style for the bland batter. A quick glance around, the small restaurant was half full and almost no one was eating their chicken. We didn't try their noodles but given the horrible experience with the chicken, we won't come back.","This place is a lot smaller than what I thought it was from pictures on Yelp. The food isn't too bad, but not the best either. We ordered 10 piece wings, chicken ramen w/ egg, onion rings and a lychee soju. The wings were decent, but I think a bit over fried and I still prefer BonChon. The noodles were flavorful and so was the broth but for 14 dollars (thats including the egg) it just didn't add up for me. I also saw on the menu that bubble tea is $7.99. That's like the price of 2 bbteas everywhere else. Again the prices don't add up for me. Also when we came, there weren't any asians in this place other than the workers and ourselves. There are just way more korean options on Northern Blvd. Overall : Average place with above average prices.","Doesn't matter what you order off their menu it is guaranteed to be 10/10. Seriously. I've tried their wings in all flavors, their ramen and noodles, their chicken cutlet dishes and everything fell well above my expectations.Also, their entire menu is HALAL! I'm expecting this place to be packed during Ramadan.","Came here to try their stuff mainly because they are perhaps the only halal Korean fried chicken place around NYC.I was not disappointed.This isn't a halal place that serves Korean food. It's a Korean restaurant that happens to be halal.We had the spicy ramen and the fried chicken, both were amazing and had great portions.I highly recommend them!","Food was amazing. We got the spicy beef ramen, beef bulgogi over rice and sweet and spicy wings. Everything had so much flavor and portion was big. Wings are a bit overpriced but the flavor was amazing. The place is halal and if you pay in cash you get 10% off.. ill keep that in mind for next time.. I will definitely be coming back!!","Near our hotel and was looking for just a snack. Ordered the spicy sweet chili wings. These were spicy, but so good!! A bit on the pricey side...but they were cooked well so can't complain! Service was quick.",Modoo - Chicken & Noodle Bar
475,"Wow where to begin! First off, the waiter we had was rude as hell-- bald older guy. There was 6 of us, but we needed a table for 8. They legit seated us at an impromptu table facing the wall. It was uncomfortable, loud and hard to talk to my friends at the table. I asked to be moved multiple times, since they had OBVIOUS open tables. The waiter didn't understand sh*t we were saying-- and kept saying the table is for 6, but we were 6 at the moment! And if you've ever been here, the long table seating can fit at least 12.  Our drinks took more than 40 minutes to come out. Our food-- oh my god. About an hour! I asked the waiter when the food will be out and he swear to god said ""what do you want there's two people working there just wait""-- so rude! And when it came out, sh*t was undercooked. I asked to take it back and the waiter looked at me so nasty. Like b*tch I'm not going to eat this raw meat! On top of that, the burger was legit mini sized in a huge bun! Wtf bro! Hookah was horrible! Burned my throat. Honestly this place is trash as hell. Don't bother going. Loud annoying music playing repeatedly and sh*tty ass service. Save your $$ and go elsewhere.","I typically choose not to believe the hype of negative reviews and try to base my own opinion after gathering up enough information from the good and the bad. I'm sad to say, however the bad reviews involving delivery were definitely not wrong at all. I placed an order tonight and kept it simply to the appetizers menu in hopes there would be no trouble, but somehow between the time the order went in and the food arrived there was a major disconnectThe Otro Rollo: was cold, a slight disappointment since most enjoy their meat warmThe Spicy Garlic Wings: (that I specified to be boneless and cooked crispy) are bone in AND a sad soggy mess. A heavy disappointment since that was to be the bulk of dinnerThe Carribean Quesodilla: ...well I don't know anything about it since it didn't come with my order.Then upon reaching out to the restaurant about the outcome of my order they would only offer a refund in regards to the quesadilla because ""I got the other items"". So minus a star for each of the 4 points above!Sometimes if you see a lot of negative reviews just take them for what they're worth and look elsewhere. I will be working with my bank to get a full refund for this order and then not spending a dime here afterwards","I placed an order for yelp and 45 minutes later I got a message saying that my order was canceled, but the money was taken from the account.Horrible.","I was in the area for a work event and I had a craving for Spanish cuisine. My coworkers were undecided on dinner, but I was able to talk one of the guys into tagging along for food and hookah. I researched places nearby and found a few choices. Crazy Willy's seemed to have everything I wanted (food, drinks, and hookah). We arrived to find only a few patrons at the establishment. I hoped that I hadn't made a mistake in judgement. There was one waitress working and she told us we could grab a table anywhere. We opted not to sit in the front where you could look out through the big open windows because the streets were calm and quiet, so there wouldn't be any ""people watching"" at this time of night. We grabbed a table in the corner and looked over our menus. There were so many items, which made my decision difficult. However, I was able to narrow it down to a calamari appetizer, and a churrasco skirt steak, sautéed with garlic, rice, and beans for my entree. My coworker ordered the fried pork with Caribbean sauce, and sweet plantains. We also asked for a pitcher of sangria. The waitress seemed a little flustered by our orders in the beginning, but as the night went on I realized there was a small language barrier. We received our sangria. It was fantastic. Not too sweet, just the right amount of fruit and alcohol. Our meat arrived later. We inquired about our sides, which arrived a few minutes later. The waitress asked if we wanted anything else. We inquired about the calamari appetizer. She said, ""oh, that's coming later."" We asked if we could cancel the appetizer and just enjoy our entrees, she obliged. My steak, rice, and beans were absolutely FANTASTIC!!!! The chef made a fresh garlic sauce that bursted with flavor. The rice and beans were a standout all on their own. I kept eating my beans well after my rice and steak were gone. My coworker was in amazement after he took his first bite of pork. He said the flavor was unlike anything he ever had. He also spoke highly of the sweet plantains. We decided to grab hookah here as well. The waitress advised that they only had mint hookah that evening, we didn't  mind. We liked the hookah, but felt that it took forever for the coal to do its job. We asked for another coal and the second one seemed to work much better than the first. I noticed that we were one of two tables left and thought it was time to head out since we had stayed past Crazy Willy's closing time (12 midnight). However, I never felt rushed to leave and our waitress kept telling us it was okay to stay because a few people walked in around 11:50 pm to have dinner. We really enjoyed our experience at Crazy Willy's. We agreed to return if we are back in the area for another event.","Had lunch here on Saturday. It was Ehhhh. Time me and my boyfriend where the only ones there. It took my food almost an hour to come out. The chef was nice enough to send me out chips. I was STARVING. I had the chicken with shrimped wrapped in bacon in white sauce with vegetables. It was good but not an hour wait good. My boyfriend had the chofan. It was a disappointment. It had great presentation, but it was very oily, not to our liking. The only good thing here was our avocado chicken appetizer! AMAZING. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, do not order a margarita from here, it taste like shit. I even gave it another try and ordered a passion fruit one.--No hope. Other than that, you should come here for the hookah and regular drinks, they serve those well here and not too pricey. I will probably be back and give it another try, idk.. i will keep you all posted.",Great place food is delicious it's always my to go spot when I can't make up my mind on what to eat.,Crazy Willy's
476,"I really don't understand why this place is always packed and popular. Drink specials are not great, food is good but not memorable, brunch special is typical ... atmosphere is like a collage bar and extremely loud.","Well I had such high hopes for here but they were dashed. Since I was by myself, I was able to get a table, but then I had to wait to order. My food came relatively quickly, and it was ok tasting, but super greasy. Corned beef grilled cheese shouldn't be THAT greasy. So I ask for the check and a box and the waitress just brings over the check and before I could even open my mouth to ask for a box, she walks off. For literally over 15 mins. During this time there are 3 other employees standing there ""checking ID's"" who I tried to flag down to bring me a box, but they just kept ignoring me. So every 5 mins I reduced the tip on the check til finally she returned and I had to ask for a new one. And I asked for a to go box, yet again. So what did she do? Grabbed my food and then walked off for another 5 minutes. Do you seriously think I ate it then? Get it together. And yep, I didn't leave a tip, because that was just ridiculous and uncalled for and that's the second time in my life I've ever done that, so that's saying something. If your service is that bad that a yelp elite isn't leaving a tip, and we ALWAYS tip, you have a serious issue.","Trash, the vibe is cool. But the food...yeah that's gonna be a no for me dawg. #keepwriting #keepwriting #keepwriting","This place is AWESOME. I will preface this with saying that the food was pretty good but the reason for 5 stars is the mix of the service, food/drink options and the environment.I went with a couple gfs for the bottomless brunch on a Sunday morning. We got there a little bit before open at 11am and there was already a couple groups there waiting to get in! We got a table right away and had amazing service from there. Out waiter stopped by and immediately asked if we wanted to do the bottomless brunch. A minute later he was back with glasses for drinks. From there he continuously showed up to top off our glasses. It was never empty! We were able to switch between mimosas, Bellinis and bloody marys. The Bellinis and mimosas were boozy! There was just a touch of juice in each and mostly bubbly which is exactly how my friends and I like them. Definitely worth the $21!For food, I got the shakshuka and my friends got the avocado toast, breakfast waffle sandwich and the California egg scramble. The shakshuka was good but didn't taste like anything special or different than I could have made at home or had tried anywhere else. My friends all seemed pretty happy with their food.The environment of this place was the icing on the cake. It got busy right away and they were bumping great music. There was just a nice buzz to the place but not too loud that you couldn't talk to the people at your table. The had a couple TVs around that had sports games on as well.",The wait was long but they text you when it's ready so you don't have to stand around. Pretty decent food and a bottomless option which is definitely worth it if you plan on drinking more than 2 drinks. It was busy and they play loud music - prime brunch time - but we had a corner table in the front so it wasn't too bad. Really the only downside was that the server couldn't seem to find his way to the front very often. I think he had some bigger parties in back. I would go again but probably with less people so we can sit at the bar.,"The Flying Cock is a surprisingly good gastropub. The food is just delicious.  The tuna tartare tacos are amazing, and the blackened salmon Caesar salad is great, too.  Their Caesar has these tasty polenta breadcrumbs.  The service is polite and very efficient, and the environment is clean and laid back.  Highly recommended!",The Flying Cock
477,"My boyfriend and I have been going to this place ever since opening week years ago. Even after moving from Astoria to Elmhurst, we still try to make the 15 min drive here to get poke once a week.The reason for the 2 stars is because of the old lady at the register. For such a young, ""trendy"" poke shop, we have no idea why PokeWave would have such a bitter, rude, unhappy woman working the storefront.Every. Single. Time. we go there and I place my order, she always asks, ""So you want ALL these sauces?"" with an attitude. NO, I JUST TICK OFF THE BOXES FOR FUN??? Never had any other employee who rang up my order say anything about it. They've always been crazy friendly and accommodating.  (FWIW, I get the classic, wave, sesame oil, eel sauce, and light spicy mayo. It tastes @$&%ing great.)The reason I'm writing this review is because of my experience that happened just a couple hours ago. I placed my usual order that I've gotten for years, still met with the begrudging, rude @$$ ""So you want ALL of this"" and side eye. We sit down to eat and it was burn my mouth spicy. I couldn't eat more than a couple bites and my boyfriend wanted to see what could be done.Guess what this lady said. ""It's because you got the spicy mayo and wave sauce."" We told her multiple times, that I've had this probably a hundred times, same order every time, and she still continued to try and blame me. ""It's because you got all these sauce! What else you get."" I wanted to tell her: I'VE BEEN GETTING THE SAME ORDER YEARS LONGER THAN YOU'VE BEEN WORKING HERE.She ended up offering to add more rice but not before muttering under her breath and walking away. FYI, we weren't asking for a replacement. My boyfriend said he's fine paying for another one if nothing could be done, so we weren't being sleazy or demanding or anything that would warrant such a nasty attitude.PokeWave. Who is she. We've seen the same horrible customer service given to other people by her. Is she someone's mom? What exactly possessed you to hire her. Who thought it was a good idea for her to be at the register and dealing with customers. Smfh completely ruined our night.",Im sad to say this place isnt as great as it used to be. My bf and i used to frequent this place but lately its really hit the mark. The portions seem smaller for the proteins and they arent as fresh as i remember them to be. We ended up throwing away $30 worth of food. I definitely wont be back.,"One of my poke go-to's! They have good ramen, too. However, some of their other offerings are not that great (see: Onigri). And it's fairly pricey, especially for delivery. But always prompt and fresh.","A+ poke at an A+ price! After visiting Oahu and eating my fill of poke there, I can say with confidence that the poke here is on par with what Hawaii offers. Although poke in Hawaii usually consists of marinated fish and rice, the combos offered here allow you to enjoy the fish just as much since the other components of the bowl pair together so well. The Wave bowl I ordered had salmon, wave sauce, onion, cucumber, edamame, cilantro, masago, seaweed salad, and kani salad. I could tell the salmon was very fresh from its color, lack of a fishy taste and smoothness. I loved how the flavors complemented each other and that I could enjoy my meal comfortably in a space with plenty of seating. The surfboards and Hawaiian phrases adorning the walls added to the authenticity of the meal. Overall, this was an amazing, satisfying meal that brought back nostalgia for my trip to Hawaii.",That was absolutely amazing. I loved in Hawaii for two years and never thought I'd find this kind of amazing food again. Great job guys.Spam bamBig Island (+Tuna)Awesome stuff,"One of our favorite restaurants in Astoria, period.  Their fish is always fresh and they allow a huge variety of toppings, including masago, fried onions, sesame, edamame, and more (most unlimited except for pricier ingredients like Avocado).  The restaurant is very clean and comfortable, and the manager Vinny is really friendly & goes above & beyond for every customer.  I try to reduce plastic waste, and when I've brought my own containers and bag he has accommodated me to use them.They recently launched their own App - I would highly recommend you ordering maybe 10 minutes before you arrive, so they can start your order.  They get so busy and Poke is a very labor intensive food to compile, (and it'll take you a long time to select all the toppings) so the App is really helpful.",PokéWave
478,"Excellent, nostalgia of every food flavor I've missed from back home. This restaurant has more dishes from outside if central Greece, you won't find in other restaurants.Some recommendations:KontosouvliFeta in phillo Dakos HortaAnd tirokafteri","As big fans of Bahari, every so often we try other Greek restaurants in Astoria (we like Gregory Taverna which is a block from E Taverna).  After eating at E Taverna, we were surprised that it got 4 1/2 stars.  Salad was ok but tomatoes were mushy; gigantes were not good; lemon potatoes were ok; octopus was ok; branzino was tasty and good.  One and done here.","Very fresh and authentic cooking, music, ambianceTry then octopus appetizer, horiatiki salad with feta and tsaziki meze with fried meatballs.Dinner souzoukakia and chicken kontosouvli are the main events","We recently came to E Taverna with my aunt and uncle who have been here several times before. As we are currently planning a trip to Greece, we figured we should go to an authentic Greek restaurant to eat some food, drink some beverages, and have a great time.My aunt made a reservation for Saturday evening. That afternoon (the same day as our reservation) the restaurant called to say they had someone reserve the inside so we would be seated outside. We had made this reservation almost two weeks in advance. It's ridiculous that someone was able to swoop in and just grab the entire interior when they had a book full of reservations already confirmed. We arrived and sure enough the inside was packed with a birthday party. Someone on the staff gave us a table outside which ended up being fine but it was muggy out and we would have preferred to be seated indoors.The waitress who gave us our complimentary pita and cheese dip only spoke Spanish and told us this when we went to place a drink order. Luckily my boyfriend is fluent so we got that straightened out. Soon the manager Nico ended up taking care of us and he profusely apologized for having us seated outside. We ended up ordering a bunch of mezes to share. Some favorites were the sausage (so good with an ice cold beer), the pork bites (the sauce is amazing!), and the greens (simple but very good). The potatoes with feta were just french fries with feta on top - good but not worth ordering again. The octopus is something we all typically love but the large order is overpriced for a small piece of octopus with little seasoning. For dessert they brought us cheesecake for my aunt's birthday.Overall if you want real deal Greek food this is the spot, however, beware of the reservation process and the language barrier with some of the wait staff. If this were to happen again with us being forced to sit outside I would honestly bump this review down to three stars.","Visiting Astoria for the weekend, I asked my wife what she wanted to eat. She replied, ""Greek!"" A quick search of Yelp found this Taverna just a few blocks from where we are staying. E Taverna did not disappoint. We ordered everything to share and still had leftovers. We were greeted before we could even get to the door. Being a nice night we selected to sit outside. We were eagerly attended to and every question was answered. We started with  Horiatiki, a tomato and cucumber salad. Get the medium to share. We then had the cheese sampler. Yes it had more feta, but it was fantastic. I love halloumi and the other selection, I believe it was Saganaki, was fantastic. Then came the Pikilia, a meat sampler with fries. This dish included meatballs, sausage, chicken and beef with  tzatziki. Again, get this with the intent if sharing. We finished off with a small piece of cheese cake. Let me sum this up quickly. E Taverna is on my go to list when visiting the NYC area. Great place, you have to try.","Very quaint place to meet your friends for dinner. Music wasn't loud and there is even seating outside in the warmer months. A table next to us celebrated a birthday and they brought a beautiful cake with sparklers. The meal includes dessert! We had a delicious complimentary cheesecake. We ordered family style so that all of us could sample many dishes. Our choices included spanakopita, stuffed peppers, moussaka, Horatiki salad and calamari. Our friend had Fix beer from Greece. He seemed to enjoy it. The food was excellent. The service was good and we had an enjoyable evening.Only down side is that they only accepted cash for tips. Who carries cash these days? The server would have received a larger tip had it not been for this policy.",E Taverna To Koutouki
479,I come here for the lunch boxes it's not bad for the price and how much they give. But have not seen anything special. Tried the rolls also. Not a bad place to try.,"I don't get the hype. It's okay, but not worth texting about. The rolls were fine but nothing special. The best part of our meal was the soy bean tea. Sweet service, though.",Try their teas!,"This was my second time here and I forgot to post a review for this restaurant the last time I came. Hibino is a great japanese restaurant. I believe they are authentic too which is great.Entering, the interior looks very japanese and I love it! From the bamboo ceiling to the tables, it brings a lovely vibe, including the bathroom! I was seated with my friend and was instantly given menus, along with a small chalkboard of the day's lunch special behind my chair which was convenient and nice.When the food came, it all came piping hot (except for the sushi, of course). When the food cooled down, I had a wonderful meal. The tonkatsu with the sauce was delicious. My friend enjoyed her sushi and we both enjoyed our miso soups. You can definitely taste the freshness of the soup, especially the soft tofu.Hibino is located a few feet from one of the entrances to the Vernon Blvd - Jackson Ave 7 train station which is great if you travel by train! The Queens Midtown tunnel is also close by if you take the 495. The Pulaski bridge is close as well, if you bike or drive.I will be back for more Hibino meals as they are priced well and the atmosphere is very welcoming. I highly recommend you come here and try their tasty selection of japanese foods.","I love the ambience of this place. Their large windows let in a lot of sunlight. We ordered their seaweed salad, sushi entree, sashimi entree, the beef kakuni, and the fried eel roll.I will say that the rolls were quite nice and innovative. But one nigiri (cant tell which) in the sushi entree was a little too fishy for my taste. Other than that, I would say the experience was pretty good. Kakuni was so juicy! It could be a good go-to casual sushi joint to visit in LIC! The service is friendly, and the free post-meal tea is the quite comforting. I would visit again when I'm in the area.","Be sure to try their rotating selection of obanzai! For $5 each, you get a little plate of home-y comfort which I really appreciated. I got a chicken soup obanzai, which was a bowl of flavorful clear broth with juicy thigh meat chunks, strips of carrot, spheres of taro, and some kind of crispy mochi dumpling.I also got the appetizer of fresh steamed vegetables with a tofu dip and it was such a refreshing delight. I feel like most vegetable options in restaurants are cold raw salads, or unfortunately doused in cheese or some other kind of fat. But here, it was just crisply blanched vegetables (snow peas, okra, Chinese broccoli, etc. etc.) and nothing else. Like an Asian crudite. Mmm!I tried the boxed salmon sushi too, and it was quite tasty. The salmon was lightly cured and the rice was rather flavorful.",Hibino
480,"Although the food is good, the atmosphere and service was not. We were ignored. Ladies all had attitudes. Rather than helping to clear the tables, the shoved the food onto the table. No ""thank you""s. In fact, just down right snobby. They also missed a dish we asked for. Disappointed.","Food is so good, warning, their spicy is real spicy, sp when the server ask which level, start with level 2 or 3.Happy hour from 5 to 11 pm.Small place, but not as tight as manhattan small restaurant.Cash onleh.",Horrible service and refused to give change .

I believe it's call Kana Moo Krob. 3 dollar beers and 5 dollar cocktails. Can't beat this place.,"Food: 4.5/5We stopped by for lunch. Ordered the beef salad, raw shrimp, minced chicken basil with preserved egg, tendon soup and tom kha soup with chicken. The beef salad was delicious. It was packed with basil and full of red onions and lemongrass. The raw shrimp had a ton of spices too with pieces of raw garlic. The minced chicken basil might have been the worst dish out of our order. It tasted bland and lacked flavor. The tendon soup is my favorite. Their tendons are perfectly cooked and has a chewy texture. The tom kha soup was delicious too but I'm not a big fan of coconut. Btw, their mild here is pretty spicy. Their mild is similar to medium spicy in other Thai restaurants.Service: 5/5I've been here a handful of times. The establishment is pretty small with limited seating. The girls here were very nice. My friend personally knows the staff members so everyone was very friendly to us.Ambiance: 2/5It's pretty dark inside. The walls are black with one red accent wall. They could use some renovation or even a new paint job. There isn't much to this place. They have one tv and a wall nail decor which sort of made the place look hip. Very plain interior. This place doesn't look appealing at first glance but I go for the food.","Looking for real eastern Thai food? This is the place. I ordered a lot and all of them is just brilliant! Spicy level is Thai level, so be careful for those who cant really handle with the spiciness. I'd love to come here everytime i come to nyc. The best !!",Playground Bar & Bistro And Taitoon Thai Karaoke
481,"Food: 3/5Ordered two steak tacos, a chicken quesadilla and chips and salsa for delivery. The steak tacos (4/5) came with two tortillas and loaded with steak, onions and cilantro. It was delicious! I ordered for delivery so the tortillas were a bit soggy and broke apart when trying to eat. The chicken quesadilla (2/5) was also soggy but lacked flavor. It had a lot of cheese and lettuce and the chicken was bland. The chips and salsa (1/5) were a big disappointment. The salsa reminded me more of curry than anything. It lacked flavor and didn't seem fresh.I'd try this place again but only for tacos. Everything else is subpar for delivery.Delivery: 4/5Came as promised during the given estimate.","Ordered three chicken enchiladas beans and rice my bill was $16 and some change. Enchiladas were bone dry hardly any sauce and not even a tablespoon of sour cream and no cheese and I paid $1.25 for less than a 2 ounce cup of guacamole. This place really sucks I've tried a few Mexican places in New York and this one was horrible, i've never had enchiladas that tasted like the Mojave Desert. Horrible taste,too expensive, waste of money. Don't bother this place is a rip off and deceiving.","Ordered online from here and was a little disappointed. While I did find this business on Yelp and the reviews spoke highly of the food, my experience wasn't as highly ranked. I ordered just a plan chicken quesadilla and the lettuce was brown. I also ordered guacamole on the side and it was brown which is a shame because I would normally eat it if it's from my own cooking but when it's from a restaurant I'm not sure how long it's sitting out. I'd try it again because my roommate got a burrito and loved it but my meal wasn't great. Pretty affordable and they have bowls, salads, burritos, and enchiladas.",Very cheap and worth it.  Real tacos and good service. Al pastor was the best!!! I would cone back here. But parking was an issue,"I am so picky with Mexican food. If done right, it's amazing. If not, it feels cheap and disappointing. This place was certainly above average. It wasn't all bad. They have a salad bar with sauces and garnishes you can add to your meal. It had a homey vibe about it. My waiter was very friendly and sweet. Not once did he rush me to leave and only gave me the bill when I asked for it. If I'm in the area, I'll stop by.","The attraction to Homemade Taqueria feels strange to me. The food is somewhere in the middle of the Mexican cuisine spectrum, yet I'm always content to eat here. This is an establishment that has awesome qualities that go beyond the food: great prices, a low key ambiance, and excellent customer service.As someone who has found more disappointment than gems regarding the state of Mexican food in NYC, Homemade Taqueria isn't life changing enough to go against the grain. Some things that I'm not a huge fan of:* The guacamole, despite sporting chunks of onions, corn, tomatoes, feels a bit watered down.* Mexican rice is fluffy but lacks seasoning.* Strange but true, the lettuce they add to various dishes feels a tad excessive. This is not a bad thing per se, but too much of anything is never appealing. Thankfully, that's where most of my gripes end, because I really love:* The salsa bar. Sure, it's dine in only, but they do a good job keeping it clean and fresh. (It could be a tad spicier)* The fact they make their tortillas in house. Nothing delights me more than seeing the ladies grill their tortillas like their life depended on it.* The fast delivery. I am never waiting long for much here. * The cheesy options. As in they will add Qaxaca cheese to just about anything you want. * The fact they serve picaditas, tlacoyos, sincronizadas, and an impressive array of tortas.The staff here is awesome. They typically go out of their way to please regulars and new patrons alike. The fact they will substitute most things off their menu for gluten free, meat free, dairy free, etc. shows they're willing to be flexible. In many ways, they're the reason I show love and encourage others to check this place out.",Homemade Taqueria
482,"Came here for lunch on a Sunday and ordered a casserole which I know takes about 10 minutes to make. We patiently wait and nosh on the side dishes. We asked for some more side dishes. They never brought them. By now we have already waited 20 minutes for our casserole and were starving. We asked the girl if we could get more side dishes (which they either forgot or didn't want to bring) and this time she said WAIT. When she said that, it wasn't a ""oops sorry I forgot to bring the side dishes "", nope none of that. It wasn't a ""please wait a minute"". It was a WAIT. FULL STOP. What kinda customer service is that?? The other waitress and walked by many times seeing that our side dishes were empty and she even refilled the table next to ours side dishes without asking so it is definitely not a matter of ""we don't do refills"".  When the spicy chicken casserole finally presents itself (5 min later, total of half hour wait by now) chicken is tasteless and bland. The broth is fine but the chicken was not salted or marinaded at all. My guess..the broth is the same spicy broth they use for all casseroles so readily available but they just threw chunks of unmarinaded chicken (not even with the slightest bit of salt). In any event, we didn't eat the chicken bc it was so bland and just had some of the soup. This has got to be one of the worst Korean meals I have ever had along with horrible service. Never again!",I had high expectations for this Korean stew but it was quite bland. The only redeeming factor was how tender the pork was. The price is quite reasonable but I likely won't return since the soup wasn't very good.,"DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU LIKE DIRTY FOOD.My mom and I as well as bunch of my friends used to order here all the time but we stopped after the day they decided to feed us expired or ""not good"" food. (Which was literally two days ago). My mom and a few of my friends that day ordered and ate: sliced pork feet, potato stew and the egg soup. They all got a severe food poisoning reaction and had swollen up with bumps all over their body. We went to Urgent Care as soon as possible and once we did they said that it was food poisoning. We called Geo So Gi and asked for the owner and they said he was out of town on vacation so they couldn't do anything except give us the owners number. They didn't even apologize or take responsibility. Upset, my mom decided to call the owner and he didn't take responsibility nor he did not apologize. They were rude when we asked for help. This is why people say money ruins people. They used to be nice and had good service. Don't know what happened. And I will state again, Please do not go here anymore.","I'm glad I pick thid place because all we ordered was yummy! Its actually a little different from any korean restaurant I've been to before. The food is seriously delicious and lots of food choices in their menu. They have combo choices of food for groups. We start of with seafood pancake which we enjoyed. Its soft and lots of seafood. For main dish we had the gamja tang+ mukeunji bossam for 4 people and its a lot of food for us. Its a huge pot of pork meatbone soup and it comes with a plate of slices of pork with oyster on the side. Its actually my first time eating this type of korean food and for sure not my last because I'm surely going back. I enjoyed everything from the soup to the side dish and that soft pork that you eat with raw oyster and some kimchi. I love this place. The place is clean, the food is yummy and the servers are nice. I'm coming back soon!","Cuisine: 9Service: 8Decor: 6Value: 10Overall: 9Been around for a long time, yet still one of the only Korean restaurants specializing in Gamja Tang, a pork loin and vegetable spicy casserole. On a cold day, there are very few restaurants that I would prefer over Geo Si Gi.If it's your first time, order a #1, #2 or #3. Only difference is fresh vs. dried vs. pickled vegetables. The portions here are very large and you certainly get your money's worth. Just order one size smaller than you think you can eat and no food will go to waste. However, do add a noodle (ramen, udon, etc.) and ask for fried rice when you are done with the casserole. They will cook it in the same pot, which will pick up all the flavors still left on the bottom.If you need more food, order the Jok Bal, which is steamed pork leg. Order the smaller portion, it's plenty for four. This huge plate of super tender pork with skin and all that gelatinous goodness is always a hit. Dip it in the mildly spicy soy based sauce and let the party begin in your mouth. More food? Just order a Seafood Pancake like everyone else.Service is always friendly and they have parking through a driveway on the left side of the restaurant. That's a winner combination. Not sure I ever want this place to be featured in some food show that will leave me having to make reservations, but I certainly hope it has enough business to stay open for as long as I got teeth.",Surprised I missed this place when I thought I've been to every Korean restaurant in Queens. I ordered the Geosigi Gamjatang for 2 ($33.95) and that was more than enough for 2 asian girls with big appetites. The Gamjatang was super hot and full of lots of good stuff. The side dishes were all DELICIOUS (you know a restaurant is good if they have yummy side dishes) and the service was good as well. I would definitely come here again if I was craving some hot Korean stew :),Geo Si Gi
483,Recent update. Haven't been in over a year and this place  sadly has changed a lot and gone downhill. The space has so much potential but to lose the bbq and move to a small (mediocre) menu is a big mistake. Food was not good.,"I went here one time thinking it was good. It looked like a chill place but their food was disgusting. Cold, stale and NOT fresh. Their drinks, horrible. On top of that....their service was HORRIBLE. All the staff seemed annoyed. I was so disappointed and on top of it all they over priced us. (Group of 4). NEVER again I can still taste their disgusting smoked BBQ Ribs. It was like trying to eat a Elephants toe nail. That's just how hard and stale it was. Just typing a review is getting me angry.",This place went from having self-serve water stands to charging $2 for a glass of tap water? No thanks.,"Great place for a quick beer. All American BBQ and outdoor seating. They have room for a band to set up and play live music. The food has large portions, we ordered one meal and then kept ordering more as we enjoyed our beer. Speaking of which, they have many beers on tap and the bartenders are very nice and efficient when there is a long line. I hope to spend more evenings here this summer.","This place has recently re-opened.  The menu has down-sized to salad, sandwiches, burgers, shrimp, baby back ribs, souvlaki, wings and fish instead of the platters of meats like in the past.  Go to the bar to order food and drinks.  Order the baby back ribs (6) which comes with a large tray of thin fries.  It is ok though miss the pitmaster with the various meats.If you come for the casual atmosphere, drinking craft beers, and listening to live music, it's great.  Plenty of long wooden tables with wooden benches.  Since it wasn't crowded, we stayed a while to chit-chat.  There is an outdoor garden in the back.  The band was still setting up on a Friday night so didn't get to hear them.The women's restroom has 2 stalls.  It's clean though musty smell that day.","This place used to be great before it was closed by the Department of health, great bbq by the pound, live music great atmosphere, So when we saw the doors open once again, we just had to go.Since it re-opened, this place is not so great, drinks are still pretty decently priced, but the food is terrible. The bbq by the pound has been replaced with a limited menu, The brisket sandwich was incredibly bland,  the ribs were pretty tasteless as well, and i think the cole slaw we got might have went bad.As it stands, its not very good, and i hope things are getting back to the way they used to be because it used to be awesome.",The Strand Smokehouse
484,"ToTaLLy croWded... those letters sums up exactly how it felt, sooo many people on a weekend waiting, almost chaotic.   And yes, they will keep waiting if they have to - that also means their food is very solid!!!!  Valet parking is also convenient, too.  Make sure to tip the guy.Sharing tables is also an option - i actually do not mind.","Just had dim sum brunch here, we got lucky to beat the crowd.  By the time we left, the place was packed and a bunch of people from the front entrance to the back were waiting to be seated.This place is huge and the cart ladies pass by in regular intervals.  They offer the same food as any other dim sum place.  Service is slightly better because most servers speak English (my Chinese is kindergarten level haha) so it was easy to get what we want if it's not in the cart in front of us.Oh, the only dim sum food that I didn't like was the minion bao.  It had black sesame filling but man it's bad (in my lifetime of eating - and I do love to eat - it takes a lot for my taste buds to find food that's unacceptable tastewise.).  So bad I couldn't finish it and left half on my plate (growing up, I was taught to never leave food on my plate no matter what.  But I'll make an exception with this minion bao).",Haven't been here since the fire but the food has definitely gotten worse. The presentation was nice but the taste was mediocre. We kept flagging down a waiter to get simple service needs. We also had non stop visiting flies. Very disappointing to say the least.,"Dim sum: 3 stars at bestService: 0 star if I couldDim sum was mediocre at best. What really grinds my gear is how extremely rude the staff was. I'm talking about you, male host who screamed at me and my 85yo grandma (!!!!) before we even got a chance to sit down.I was helping my grandma walking out of the bathroom and this host lunged at us and asked us what number we have. I told him our number. He started yelling at us about how they've called our number a couple times already. My grandma was super sweet and apologized a couple times... BUT WE WERE IN THE BATHROOM. That's not how you treat your customers, especially not the elderly.120% will not return.","We went to New Lake Pavilion for dim sum. The dim sum is pushed around on little carts so you can see what you like & order it. This review is for dim sum only.DIM SUM summary (I use ^ to indicate a half-star and * for a full star. So, ***^ means 3.5 stars):****^ BBQ pork buns are very good. The filling is good, but the pastry is great, flaky but also a little soft and gummy, excellent texture***^ Steamed sticky rice chicken wrapped in lotus leaf is pretty good. The filling is tasty & the flavours get absorbed into the sticky rice. The texture of the rice is good.*** Fried Taro root dumpling is flaky and puffy on the outside, and soft on the inside. This was okay but not as flavourful or crispy as I'd like*** Salt Water Dumpling is solid. Nothing exceptional, but tasted okay**^ Braised chicken feet taste okay. Unfortunately, the chicken feet weren't cooked as much as they should be so that the flavours would get absorbed in better. There were only 3 feet in the dish, cut into halves. The dish is mostly peanuts (on the bottom). **^ White Radish cake is so-so, with not enough radish or wok flavour. This is usually one of my favourites, but this version was not very tasty.**^ Rice noodle rolls with scallions are very soft, and lacking flavour. Most of the flavour comes from the soy & hoisin sauces that are added on top, but there was not enough sauce. It would have been better with sesame sauce.** Shrimp dumplings with chives is disappointing & not flavourful. There was hardly any shrimp. Usually, I'd want these to be full of plump, succulent shrimp *^ Stuffed pepper is bland. I wouldn't recommend.* Chestnut cake is sweet. The texture is okay, but I'm not a fan of how it tastes. I wouldn't want this again.SERVICE is good.PARKING is difficult to find in the area. But they do have Valet Parking right next to the restaurant, which is well-serviced.","Normally I don't write a review unless it is super good and very unique or Terrible and people should stay away. Average restaurant I normally not write anything. But today was something I must write. This is a dimsum place I always go to (always) why? Because it's away from Central Flushing, next to the highway (LIE). Street parking not as bad if u are willing to walk 2 resident blocks. I come here with my family normally with s big party 6-12 people, of course a wait time for such large party. Foods are good service good ok, cleanse (ehh) just ask waiter to replace it if dirty. Never had an issue. (AVERAGE)Today I came here as a party of 3 they inner section (attach is a picture I took from another Yelper of this place) just want to give you a sense of where. The cart can't reach where we were sitting. And they will skip you. The only people that would come is the hand held ones. Yes the dimsum cart will ignore you. I was able to flag a waiter to tap the dimsum cart lady, ask her what she have and she goes and tell me I can't get there and you will need to come out and see. Like WTF, you can just tell me what you have and that's it. The next person this lady tell the whole lost to the customer which was sitting outside of the edge where the cart pass.Next 3 cart pass, Had to get up run to the cart and pick up my own dimsum which each plate is very HOT. To the owner if he/she is reading this. Table layout very important. Something like this would affect how a customer is treated by your employees. Larger party gets treated much better.*tip: share table will normally be in the route where the cart lady travel. Will have a easier time to get food than the table I got. (Unless you don't want to share table with stranger then good luck)Food: 4 star ( Dimsum only )Waiting Time: 5-10 mins and some time 20-30mins depending how busy.Waiter: 4 starsDimsum cart lady: 3star (for today 1 star)Cleanse: 3 star It not like I'm giving a 1 star. still gets a 3 star for being average.

I can honestly say that I have never had a bad meal. This place really is as good as it gets. As you walk in through the door you are greeted by Giovanni, the friendly and warm owner of Paul Michaels. Out come the menus, water and complimentary oven baked mini croissants. Whether you dine here for lunch or dinner, the food is consistently good and moderately priced. The Chef's Special (penne pasta tossed in vodka sauce and baked with spinach, chopped chicken cutlet and mozzarella cheese) is especially good. I would also recommend the Eggplant Rollatini appetizer, Chicken & Tomato pizzette, Rigatoni Bolognese and Chicken Marsala. Whether you go with coworkers, friends or family, you will leave satisfied.","Having a plain cheese slice of pizza for lunch.As always I am enjoying the pizza.I was warmly welcomed by the owner as he always does with all the guests.If you are looking for lunch or dinner try coming here.There is free parking in the private lot.The food and service, is excellent and prices are reasonable.",Having a plain cheese slice of pizza and a small soda after a trip to the drug store next door.As always a great meal,Paul Michaels Brick Oven Pizza Restaurant
486,"I've been to Maria's more than 9 times at this point, and I am never disappointed.For starters, I love the quiet, close, environment and family feel it gives.I also love the complimentary pita and different sides to dip it in, my favorite is the chick peas... yum, rocks my world!I almost always order the grilled octopus as an appetizer, tender, juicy, flavorful, and most of all delicious! I love the salad it comes with as well. I've had so many dishes here, I mean I think I've literally tried the whole menu that features fish(I don't eat meat).I've enjoyed all of them.I love the lemon potatoes, must get for any dish you get! Nowwww the dessert, I don't remember the name, just say her chopped dessert dish! Oh my goodness, it is amazing. Worth every calorie, and extra burpee in the gym! It's so amazing!I love this place!","Came here for the first time this Sunday. Unfortunately, I have to give an one-star review for the horrible management. We called ahead and specifically requested a high chair for our friend's 7-month-old baby + a reservation for 5 adults. When we arrived, the table was set correctly (a table of 6 with 5 adult chairs + a high chair in the middle). Baby was asleep in the stroller off to the side but we knew we were going to need the high chair for when the baby would wake up. 15 minutes into our meal, the owner (Maria's husband) suddenly walked over to our table in a huffy, angrily grabbed the high chair, and loudly dragged it over to an empty table, without a single word. We were too stunned to say anything but we all looked at him extremely confused. He didn't make eye contact, didn't say anything, didn't confirm whether we still needed the chair... just walked away with it and didn't look back. We thought maybe, surely, another party had called who were arriving shortly and requested a high chair and there was only one in the entire restaurant?? NOPE, the empty table remained empty for the remainder of our time at the restaurant -- probably another hour. The baby woke up and we were forced to hold him on our lap in the meantime. Luckily, our friends had brought a mini portable booster seat just in case. The owner continued to make dirty looks at us for the remainder of the meal.I asked the wait staff why our high chair was taken away from us. They were gracious and tried to be helpful but could not provide an answer as to why the owner had taken the high chair away like that. They looked extremely uncomfortable and could not explain. I am still incredulous and do not understand why the owner targeted us that way. Perhaps it was because we were a fully Chinese table and the owner just didn't like us??... Truly cannot think of a reason to take away a high-chair from a 7-month-old baby, without a single word or question to confirm whether we still needed it, especially since we specifically requested it. Let that speak for itself and be wary.Beyond that, the ""Maria's oysters"" were filled with 95% spinach and cream sauce and had barely 1/6 of an oyster in them. Of the 6 oysters that come in an order, I would guess they cut an oyster into six pieces. The breading on the fried calamari was unappetizing. The red snapper and branzino were dry and flavorless. Everything was extremely overpriced. Overall a very disappointing experience and do not recommend.","Afer waiting for more than an hour to get a table with a reservation, we wait for the food for another hour, Two dishes were missing and it took another twenty minutes to bring them, the food tasted insipid, the meats were overcooked, very bad experience in celebrating my mother's birthday a total fiasco!!!","This place lived up to the hype. One aspect that really stood out was the service. Our waiter was very helpful when we asked for suggestions on what to order. He suggested a dish with two large shrimps which I believe he said was on a seasonal/special meal. He checked on us often and even got us an extra plate of the free small dishes. In addition to the shrimp, we got the twin lobster tails which was tastier than expected but also pretty pricey ($56 for tails) and the lamb souvlaki which was very juicy but kind of hard to eat because of how chewy it was. For sides we got the vegetable rice which was not out of the ordinary to be honest. One thing though, the complimentary pita bread they offer was absolutely delicious. I couldn't stop myself from eating all of it; best pita I've had!","Yep, place is real deal Greek food. Seafood was fresh and well prepped. Pastichio was divine. Normally not my fave. Menu has a good selection of fish, not just shellfish, which rings true of a great Greek spot. Will have pics for my next visit.Not much to say here other than all the press from Chopped is well deserved.","My friend and I had high expectations due to the rate but reality was quite disappointing.The food was overall very salty, but ""It's USUALLY salty."" was everything I heard from the server. I seriously wanted to ask the other customers whether if they think our food was okay to eat.Especially the stuffed chicken, I actually thought  they might've poured a good amount of salt by accident.Also, I ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail (I'm avoiding alcohol due to health issues) but came out to be the original, alcoholic cocktail and I ended up drinking the strongest part of the drink. Very unpleasant.There was only one staff who was working hard to fill the needs of the customers, I'm giving an additional star just for him.",Maria's Mediterranean
487,"I would give this place zero stars if I could. Ordered delivery through grub hub (for which the restaurant has their own driver), the order took 2 hours to get to me and I live 10 minutes away. Their reason being that the driver couldn't reach me on my phone (he found my house just fine the second time without calling and when I asked why they called the first time I got no answer).  They said the food would be remade or I could get a refund. I said ok remake the food. They definitely didn't do that because they obviously didn't even bother to reheat it. The food was lukewarm, some of it cold, when it got here. The fried dumplings were a soggy mess that fell apart when we picked them up. The scallion pancakes were sooo chewy and just really not pleasant to eat. The sauce spilled all over the bag. The two soups we got - beef and tomato ramen was bland and my husband didn't even eat it. Nothing about was like normal ramen. The braised beef noodle soup tasted like fish. I was not prepared for that and I can't even finish it. The only things that actually tasted decent were the soup dumplings, too bad they were cold. I contacted grubhub and asked for a refund. The restaurant refused the refund. They pretty much told me they would remake the food just so I wouldn't get a refund. Don't ever order delivery from here. And honestly their food wasn't anything that would make me want to try eating there in person.",Worst service ever !!!! They expect you to know that if you order to take out  and eat in you have to tip.tyen be super rude about it when you dont even know that information. They should take a class in customer service before start serving people. Regret every dollar spend.,"The pork is 100% cooked, I ask the server to tell the chef but the answer is - ' it is well done , not raw. OMG.","I come here at least once a week. Great comfort food and so affordable. My husband and I always order too much and pack some for tomorrow's lunch and the next day I will wake up excited to eat lunch. It's definitely a neighborhood restaurant which is much appreciated. The wait staff is actually pretty friendly for a Chinese place. Would recommend the pan fried dumplings, the congee and clay pot rice. You do have to doctor it up a bit but that's ok. Tastes like home!!","Absolute nightmare!Horrible customer service & noodle soup taste & smell like feet...My husband ordered 1 noodle soup & 2 pan fried noodle dish and in the mist of worst customer ever, they gave us 3 noodle soup that taste like feet.Please save yourselves & go to different noodle spot!They are disgusting!!!!",I enjoyed this  restaurant. It's actually a chain restaurant there's two in queens and one in Chinatown Manhattan.  If you're in search of a traditional wonton noodle soup then here's the place for you.  The broth is authentic and the wontons are made fresh and plump.  We also enjoyed the steam rice rolls along with our ice coffee and milk tea.  Although the beverages did not taste like classic Hong Kong style tea it wasn't that bad.  Would we return? Most definitely.,E Noodle House
488,"I've never craved for congee ever... but I've been craving for this lately. Congee to me is 'sick people food', because when I was growing up, you only eat congee when you're too sick to consume flavorful food. BUT, after my nail tech recommended me about this place, I thought, why not. Their congee is thick, not watery. It is so flavorful and so filling. I could not finish the whole entire bowl so I had to take it to go. I forgot to write the view for this restaurant so I'm pulling details from my memory. I got the congee with crab and cheese, and my boyfriend had the one with beef. It was so good to the point my boyfriend asked me when do I want to go back.","Very disappointed in this restaurant. I specially ordered a juk without salt for my child. When I arrived the cashier had given the juk I had ordered to someone else. I had to wait 20 minutes in the car with the baby for a new one.When I came home I realized that they had given us the wrong order. When my mom called  to ask why we were given the wrong order, the lady seemed to be annoyed with us and said we didn't order correctly from the beginning. Unbelievable.","It's a really bad experience for me, we order 2 congee and have to wait like more than 30 minutes. We never push them but just wait patiently. We are too hungry so we decided go to next door purchase some finger food to eat while we wait for the congee. I believe she is the owner come to our table and tell us we can't bring outside food in their restaurant. She was so rude, she can just tell us nicely not to eat outside food in their restaurant, but Jesus, 30 minutes wait for 2 bowl of congee, we didn't complain a word and they don't even apology for that but to be rude to us bu telling us not to have outside food. If they serve a bit faster we will not purchase any food for outside and eat in there.","Wow it is amazing, the food is great and it has a lot of side dishes. I've been coming here for 2 years now and the quality is still great.","pops wasn't feeling well so went with the abalone. Is the place pricey? yes. Is it a delicious meal though? hell. yes. Making juk isn't really hard--making it really frikken good is dumb hard for some reason; or rather it's easy to mess up.figured if I was going to get some anyways, I might as well see what hte fuss was about for myself too. From the first bite to the last, we could see that care and thought went into putting this meal together and making sure that this wasn't just a run-of-the-mill-why-the-hell-did-we-pay-for-this type of meal,. True, this is more common when you're not feeling well, but sometimes this is just good comfort food too.","Went there with a friend last night. There is a tiny (free) parking space around the corner from the restaurant. Should have taken a picture. Northern Blvd in Flushing can be notoriously hard to find street parking. Waitress was kind and attentive. This is a specialty dish restaurant. Wait staff speaks mainly Korean. Menu has pictures and yelp reviews definitely helps. Juk/congee/porridge is a soupy rice dish. Simple and if made at home would be inexpensive. It was nice to have a quiet night out with friends having a place to enjoy a simple dish. You have to try this place at least once, especially if you've never had it before. I would come back. FYI:  If you see ""crab"" in the title, it's imitation crab.",Bonjuk
489,Service was okay. Food wasnt the best. I ordered a mixed flajita. The chicken and shrimp was good but the steak wasnt fresh. I was extremely hungry so I told them just to remove to steak but i was very disappointed . Especially it being my first time there,Placed an order because their timeframe said they were open and they were not. Had to contact my bank to be reimbursed via Yelp orders. Please update your information.,"The first time I came to eat here was when the restaurant first opened . They didn't have their liquor license which was upsetting but I still ordered some food and was very pleased. I went to eat there for second time with my boyfriend a few weeks after that and again still no liquor and my bf didn't like that but we still ate and were happy . Recently , I went there and everything was horrible . The upside is that they finally got liquor, the downside is that my boyfriend and I have been nauseous and have had the runs all day because of the food we ate there. My boyfriend order the Al pastor tacos , guac and I got the corn soup as usual . The corn soup was not prepared the same as the first time I had it and was not seasoned the same way either. We both feel very sick and I'm very upset and would really appreciate a refund.","I met friends for drinks, as well as ordered empanadas. DELICIOUS! I had 1 chicken and 1 chorizo. The atmosphere was awesome, and the staff was very friendly. I can't wait to go back and have dinner there. They also had advertisements for paint night which would be really cool. Drinks and food were reasonably priced.","The three stars are all for the food and drinks. My friend and I got the classic steak tacos, fish tempura tacos, and pulled pork empanadas. Ah, and the churros to finish off the meal. The empanadas were deep fried and have a special sauce on it. UNBELIEVABLE. The tacos also hit the spot on taco Tuesday, but they were a bit small. The churros were made fresh and served with fudge syrup and vanilla ice cream.... Totally worth the yelp check in :p The drinks. We got the mule and passionfruit frozen margarita. I would easily pay $18 for each of those in that quality if it was Manhattan. Now comes the downfall. When we got the bill, I saw that the bill mentioned different daily specials. It was taco Tuesday, so apparently they have $3 tacos specials for any of their tacos. I asked our waiter and he said ohhh yeah he forgot to mention the specials. I asked ""ok, so what's the difference between the tacO Tuesday tacos and the regular orders"". His answer: ""oh, only the price. Taco Tuesday is $3 each vs each regular order has 2 tacos and it ranges $10 to $12"". I asked him to price match the special since he didn't mention it but he said he can't do it. I WAS JUST AT A LOSS OF WORDS AND I SAID FORGET ABOUT IT. COME TO THINK ABOUT IT I DONT EVEN KNOW WHY I TIPPED HIM!!!","can't complaint! I come here often, the bartender Matt is very friendly. The food is good and the atmosphere is great. The margaritas are great, specially the passion fruit margarita. The frozen margaritas are also great.  Definitely recommend this place for a large group, a friends get together or a family night out.",La Gringa Bar and Grill
490,"Update: been here a couple of times now and annoyed. They keep varying on what the card minimum is between $10-$15 -- $10 at night and then $15 this morning.

I work near there and eat for lunch. It was quite a walk and takes up a significant amount of my lunch time. I used to always call beforehand, order the same thing and show up 15 minutes later eat and then go. I have never missed an advance order and always show up a few minutes after I have placed the order. This has been for the past 5+ years. It is not like they don't know me. Ordering the same food at the same restaurant for a long time.One of the big shots (owner I guess you can call her) hesitates more and more each time I call to advance call my order. Now this time I am so busy I just needed a quick bite, she flat out refuses to take my order, saying the restaurant is full and all excuses. When I came the restaurant has 2-3 vacant seating, there was business, but not full blown busy. It is okay if it was really busy, but she was flat out refusing to advance order even though at times the restaurant was a ghost town. If it was a ""To Go"" order its okay, she will take the advance phone order, for you to pick up. But if it was a phone order for a dine-in, she flat out refuses.. for a regular... of 5+ years... I will make sure all my work place, my peers and the internet know about your horrible service and garbage treatment of regulars. Go to IHAWAN instead, just right beside this restaurant on the 2nd floor.P.S. Their deep fried milkfish (daing na bangus) has bones, it's not even boneless.Edit: grammar and spelling","Horrible service- came in Saturday @ 11am. The waiter ignored us and no one informed us that it was a seat yourself policy. We ordered beef tapa, longonisa, pork tocino, lechón liempo, coffees and rice.We waited over 40 minutes for our food. People who came in long after us received their food within a faster duration of time. We had to ask the waiter to give us our coffees 20 minutes later and cutlery. Overall- good food but POOR service and UNDERSTAFFED.","Sisig, Kare kare, Appetizer Sampler. Sisig was delicious, tons of meat, tons of flavor. Kare kare really blew me away. The oxtail meat that comes with it falls right off the bone, the peanut sauce is delicious and very thick in texture, loved the veggies (bok choy, eggplant). Appetizer sampler: includes fish balls, fried pork belly, lumpia, and some other things I can't remember the name of. The fried pork belly is so good. Super crunchy skin, unlike anything I've had before. The lumpia is so good, I could eat that as a meal on its own. I recommend getting their juices, they're not overly sweetened, and they have a variety of options to choose from. I got the cantaloupe juice, which had cantaloupe chunks in it. Also save room for dessert, they have a variety of traditional Filipino desserts you shouldn't miss out on! We got the sticky rice dessert, which is what they are known for. Good, warm, sweet ending to our meal. I'd definitely come back and try their halo halo, etc. So many things to try super traditional, warm home-y feels, loved my experience here. P.S. Get ready to walk out smelling like barbeque, as the smoke fills the entire room.","Renee, you will always have a place in my heart. There are many Filipino restaurants to choose from around the area, but Renee's is one of my favorite. Authentic food and a great selection of iced desserts. Try the halo halo, it is very refreshing. My favorite is the warm ube con hielo. Just a friendly reminder that on weekends, this spot gets very crowded so expect a wait. It's all worth it though, you'll see. Authentic Filipino food at its finest!","My family and I have been coming to Renee's for years.  At one point they occupied two stories but alas, they now only have the ground floor open for the restaurant.  The décor is homey with the various kitschy, handmade Pinoy decorations on the wall, some of which they sell.  The restaurant is small and has about ten tables squeezed inside.  On the weekends, they get quite crowded especially during lunch.Renee's consistently offers good food.  Dishes are authentic and taste homemade.  No frills type of food that stands on taste alone.  The menu is surprisingly extensive given that it's all listed on two pages.  They offer the usual classic items like adobo, lumpia and kare kare.  But when I go with my family, we usually order one of the samplers to get as many varieties of dishes on the table as possible.  Or sometimes we order one of the bilao platters. The bilao platters are the filipino version of a po pu platter.  There are 4 options to choose from and this will feed about 4-10 people, depending on the option you choose.There are some great dishes worth trying here.  One of my favorites is the sisig.  Delicious!  The meat has just the right amount of fattiness and crispiness.  The dish comes sizzling to your table and is so freaking good.  Another great dish is the lumpiang frito or fried spring rolls filled with shrimp, pork and veggies.  It comes with a garlic vinegar dipping sauce that is perfectly matched. They offer weekday and weekend specials for around $9 which includes your choice of two dishes (from a list entrees), along with rice, soup and soda, coffee or tea.Save some room as they also offer a lot of options for hot and cold drinks, smoothies and desserts.  There are some unusual options being offered here like the frozen yema shake or the leche con hielo drink. Overall, this restaurant delivers on food and I plan to continue to grace this establishment.",Renee's Kitchenette & Grill
491,"The taste is ok or below. Salty. Portion is ok.The membership card is a trap. The membership card supposes to give you membership discount. However, they don't allow you to use up the amount in your membership card. Your card amount has to be exactly the same or more than your bill amount, or else, guess what, they don't give you membership discount. (For example, your bill is $200, your card has $100, then you gotta recharge another $200, they don't accept any amount below $200. If you don't recharge amount, you can't have membership discount.)Ridiculous in many ways!","It is a new renovated restaurant with fancy interior design. As chinese, i would not come here for the flavor. There are definitely more tasty food with lower price","Had dinner at this place on a Saturday night. There was no waiting line. Food and service were amazing.We ordered fish with picked cabbage, Ma Po tofu, a vegetable dish and gold & silver mini bun. The flavor of the food is authentic, easily beat any Sichuan restaurant in Manhattan. Ma Po tofu is a must try.","Good service, great food!Came here with a couple of friends on a Saturday and was seated immediately. The decor is gorgeous and they have some really cool modern/ancient Chinese twist paintings. Also, their chairs are very roomy.Service was good, easy to flag down servers but they definitely didn't come and ask you how you are (which is standard for a Chinese restaurant and I love it - they're there when you need them but don't bother you otherwise). Servers speak Mandarin and English (probably also Canto, but I don't speak Canto). The food was amazing. We got a fish soup that was perfect, but the fish was bonier than expected. The cold liver dish was AMAZING. Already dreaming about it again. And we got one non-spicy dish with chicken and mu er mushrooms. Also delicious, but the real gems here are the classic spicy and numbing Szechuan dishes. Can't wait to go back and try other things - especially their desserts like fried milk.","Pleasantly surprised about how tasty everything was here. It is a much smaller space than expected so we had a short wait (which we did across the way with drinks at Iki.)  Once seated the food came out fast and furious. Wait staff are as expected: young and uninterested but polite enough to get the job done. We will return and try more items on the menu. I definitely liked the full color pages menu. It made ordering a lot easier. No alcohol license yet so it's BYOB which no one seemed to mention in the reviews (or I glazed through them and didn't notice.). We trekked a block upPrince to find a liquor store and picked up white wine. They quickly poured it into a simple decanter.  I gotta tell ya, white wine paired really nicely with sinner. It was a very pleasant experience. Just wish they had more AC. We left their drenched in sweat. Lol! Looking forward to returning.","Authentic Sichuan on the pricier side, but great for coming in groups and share family-style. My favorite was the tiny fried chicken pieces garnished with peppers - my friend and I couldn't stop eating them for a long time. The restaurant is pretty and comfortable, so it's nice to sit down for a good conversation over dinner!",Guan Fu Sichuan
492,"My office mates and I have been going to Dominie's Hoek for over five years. We go there to celebrate milestones, birthdays, team achievements and sometimes just to decompress after a long day. We often take visitors with us to Dominie's Hoek, because we have loved our local bar for a long time. We are proud to show others the laid back, unique and NYC-vibe that encompasses Dominie's Hoek. All of this changed when we recently went to Dominie's Hoek - a group of about 8 of us. We had our usual couple of drinks, nachos and some other finger foods. When we were ready to leave, we got the bill and paid in cash. I personally cross referenced, counted and re-counted a few times. We left. One of our colleagues stayed behind to use the bathroom. When she was leaving the bathroom, the server accused us of underpaying. If we did this - it was an honest mistake, and we would be glad to take ownership of that - we would never purposely short the bill or the servers at Dominie's - it's our local spot and we go there literally all the time. We always pay and always tip. Moving on, our colleague immediately offered to give the extra cash to make sure we were all settled up. No problem but it gets worse. The server asked her if we were from another country because we didn't know how to pay. When I heard about this, I was livid and sad all at the same time. This racist action is heartbreaking and it's shocking that it occurred in NYC, where many are in fact from another country. We won't be going back or recommending it to anyone - ever.",There is a creep named Armando who has tried to get violent with myself and several women I know when they turn him down and he scares women away from this bar. Apparently his girlfriend works there which is unfortunate. Several bartenders are nice but I definitely won't be back as I'd heard this man was banned last time he threatened the women I went there with and he returned. Now he has made a Yelp account to send me the following note. Great for business guy.,Don't waste your time going here. Bad service and dirty. Rude people both staff and not and the drinks are over priced,"Discovered Dominie's on Yelp when I was looking to bottomless brunch before meeting friends on the East River. I had such a fantastic time that I've gone back 5 times since. It is conveniently located on Vernon Blvd, right up the block from the 7 train. If you're just walking down the street it is easy to mixx because doesn't look like much from the outside but once you walk in theres a decent sized bar with some dining tables, a juke box and then a fabulous backyard area to dine outside. I almost always get a table outside when I come because it's such a cute patio area that you wouldn't otherwise know exists!The prices are great for the area, easily the cheapest bottomless brunch option I've found in NYC. It is $12 for an entree and $12 to add on unlimited mimosas and sangria. The waitstaff is always fairly friendly, I've had a few times where they've struggled to keep up with the patio area but I'll point the finger at understaffing. They also have a great happy hour on the weekdays from 4-8pm offering $5 drinks. Food is so good too. The omelette comes generously filled with the add-ons of your choice, the hamburger benedict is definitely a different twist on the traditional benedict but so generously portioned and the arugula salad with grilled chicken is a great diet friendly alternative! All in all, this is a great spot in LIC for brunch, happy hour, drinks with friends or a casual dinner.",Came here for my cousin's annual Birthday party. Parking is very difficult around the neighborhood. Had to park by the warehouse and run over and try not to be jacked up. He reserved a few tables in the back with outdoor seating. The staff was very fun and efficient. Our drinks were always cold and more than half way full. 2 unisex bathrooms. Great when you break the seal.,Cool bar! Draft beer $5. Tater tots were delicious. Crunchy and perfectly fried. Nachos were very disappointing. They were cold and bland. Beef and Guac looked old. It has a nice outdoor patio.,Dominie's Hoek
493,Satisfying burger and fries. A little on the pricier side but in keeping with other burger spots in NYC,"I have had Hands Up emoji burger and sweet potato fries. Neither the food nor the service was disappointing. Smoothies are authentic. If you are in the area and need to get a quick bite, this is the place to go to!","My first time here was on March 7, 2019. I ordered the Pio fries which came to almost $8!! The fries had cheese, scallions and shredded chicken on it. For the price should of been way more fries added! It tasted okay nothing over the top.",Best burger in Town. Finally some real beef. It's a great place for the neighborhood. Burgers and hotdogs. Friendly and helpful staff. I love this place.,Great food ! Burgers are on Point! I've been here twice and have not been disappointed. The bun is not soggy and toasted well . The burger itself is cooked but not dry or chewy or ladened with grease . Very creative burger options that actually taste GOOD . Great sauce combos . Not a huge fan of the fries tho . Very oily .,"So blown away. I've never had a burger like the Da Wink burger. I used to think that nothing could beat my favorite Shack Burger from Shake Shack, but the Da Wink Burger from Emoji Burger was so fucking amazing!!!! Shake shack's burgers can be greasy but the Burger from emoji didn't taste greasy at all! #FOODGASMDA wink burger -The brioche bun was nicely toasted and not a greasy mess-the beef patty was cooked thoroughly and was beefy and perfect in thickness -the lettuce and tomatoes complemented the burger amazingly and did not taste watery nor did the tomato leave a sharp taste-the American cheddar cheese surprisingly went well with the burger-applewood bacon was perfectly fried and wasn't overly crisp-a nice winky face smiling at you on the bun to hint of the good things to come The flavors all went well with each other... a wholesome burger. Def satisfied my cravings!!! Kitchen was uber clean and there wasn't any sign of grease near the flat grill top Can't wait to come back, and I hope they open more locations soon!",Emoji Burger
494,Walls and menu were dirty. Multiple orders were incorrect. Very overpriced and the food was subpar.,"Below average Greek food. Ingredients not fresh. Their lemon potatoes = plain boiled potatoes (waiter got defensive when I told him that, and he  replied ""they are boiled with some lemon"". I think he means the chef boils them while thinking about lemons. A mysterious short man with conspicuously dyed hair hovers as you dine. He is not a waiter, so don't expect him to attend to you (in fact even if he sees you trying to get the attention of the wait staff), he will look on impassively). He is just a mysterious short man doing mysterious short man things.","It was a horrible night. First of all, I'd rate the taste low to average, everything was too salty. Second, which I am very disappointed about, is the service. The server greeted us but that was all. Me and my friend waited for an hour to get the food, when the next table got their food within 15 minutes after ordering.During wait time we asked when the food will be coming out, they said it's getting ready, so we waited for another 10 minutes.The excuse for the long wait was 'The next table is having a party.' That is not an appropriate excuse. Even though the cooking takes a long time, you should tell the customers in advance when ordering. I had high expectations but my night was ruined. Never going there again.","Akrotiri was amazing. The food was excellent, great service and wonderful decor. Thespina was our server and was very patient with all of our questions, and was helpful in her recommendations. The manager and staff were also very accommodating of us sitting with a young baby in a stroller. My brother ordered multiple decisions including a black pasta dish, and a white snapper dish which was really delicious.If you want fresh delicious seafood, great service and atmosphere, then this is the place for you.","Hands down my favorite Greek restaurant in Astoria. Each dish has it's unique flavor profile and it's what sets this restaurant apart from the rest (even that super popular one off of Ditmars Blvd).We went there for a total of three times. This review is for the first two weekday dinners, the last one deserves it's own review...So let's start! What did we order for appetizers? Calamari: lightly battered and fried with capers tarter sauce. Soft and tender with a nice snap/crunch! It was delicious on its own or with the sauce!Htapodi: grilled octopus with black eyed peas, the fire roasted red peppers gave it a slight sweetness and the capers gives it a nice salty combination. Cherry shrimp tempura: this was one of our favorite dishes. A perfect balance of batter and fresh shrimp. The spicy aioli had a nice kick and the combination of flavors melt together perfectly. Pikilia: this was one amazing spread with pita bread and defines what this restaurant is about, deliciously bold. Try this first and experience what this place has to offer. Savor each spread and experience how different they are from one another. Octopus balls: so including this, we have 3 fried dishes. For most part, fried food starts to taste the same but not so here! And this was one of the many reasons why we love this place! They have very specific flavors associated with each dish and not one of them taste like another! There are no single secret sauce that they put on everything, every dish stands on its own!  With that being said let's talk about their entrees...First time we ordered...Seafood moussaka: if you love seafood, if you love Mac and cheese and if you still want to get your veggies in, this is the go to dish and my absolute favorite! It's like lobster Mac and cheese but 100xs more sophisticated with a hint of sweetness from all the fresh seafood and veggies layered into it! Elliniko bifteki: can you believe we ordered a burger from here? But what a burger!! By this time we were so full from all the other dishes that we only took a bite and had the rest to go. Our tall and super nice waiter was concerned that we didn't touch our food, but rest assure we just couldn't take another bite. So what's so amazing about this burger? First, took it home and kept it in the fridge for a day, heated up the oven and threw this huge burger for 15 minutes, it came out juicy and the smoked cheese and sauce was just as good as day one! So we went back a week later and tried some more, including the appetizers listed about. Now let's talk about their fish and sides...Second time we got bronzino and the roasted potatoes. Remember up top I mentioned better than that other place off of Ditmars? There's a reason for that, went to that other location 3 times just so I can convince myself they're good and failed each time. Ditmars Greek place is literally boiled potatoes with a splash of lemon juice! But here, they roast the potatoes wedges until there is a nice crunchy outer layer and the lemon flavor is cooked all the way through, suggested and paired perfectly with out bronzino. Thanks this time to our waitress! Last.. dessert, get the chef's special... nuff said, it's delicious! Following up with our third visit in another review. Here's a preview: I understand why some people were not happy here... two great servers. A tall waiter and a waitress, another one couldn't be found and magically appears to just catered to two tables by the kitchen on a busy Sunday evening.","Akrotiri Does it again!  How do I even start!  I stopped by and spoke to the manager in regards to hosting my birthday party at the restaurant.  I was expecting a large party, and I wasn't sure if they would be able to accommodate.  They were happy to make things works (20 people) and suggested I did a fixed price per person family style.  I mentioned some of my favorite dishes which they were happy to incorporate into the menu for the night.  For $60/pp  i had a choice of 4 different appetizers, choice of main entree(three different things to pick from) and a mixed platter of all different desserts.  The food was AMAZING as always.  The portions were amazing, my guests could barely finish eating because it was so much food!  For the dessert, they brought our my platter with giant sparkles like I was at the club while blasting ""Staying Alive"" on the sound system with everybody clapping.  It definitely was a night to remember, I cannot thank them enough for how amazing my dinner went!  Thank you Arif and the rest of the team!",Akrotiri Seafood Taverna
495,Food is great service top of the line and coronas kept coming and tiger won the masters nothing but good vibes,"Came here for Cinco de Mayo. Had $5 margarita special. The drinks were good, the bartender was okay. The food was delicious, I had the woodland flat bread. Just thought it would be a lot more lively because of Cinco de Mayo but was kinda disappointed. It was more of a hanging out/ chill spot.","Summary: Very poor service - get a manager in there to oversee things Skip the Bloody Mary - not goodMug of mimosa is mostly juice Same food as mom's but no milkshakes Good beer selection The waitress and staff were nice but service was very poor. My coffee mug had old food stuck to the rim. No one brought us waters. My Bloody Mary was missing the shrimp and was not good. I asked about the shrimp and the waitress was like oh we're out. Would've been nice if she told me and ask if I still want it. The waitress took our order and then disappeared for a long time. No coffee refill. No checking in on us. After about 20 min of waiting I finally went inside and asked about my missing shrimp, asked to swap my Bloody Mary for something else and for more coffee in a clean mug. Took a while to get all those. When the food came out the server spilled sauce on my husband's pants. The plates are too small for the food, and the servers are not too experienced and the sauce from his Mac and cheese pancakes ended up on him. The food was just ok today. A little sloppy. Too much sauce on both plates - Mac and cheese pancakes and chicken and waffles and and they were soggy. I thought the bacon is supposed to be cooked into the waffle but it sat under the chicken. Idk if it's the same kitchen as mom's or just the same menu. Doesn't seem to be the same quality as mom's exactly. And mom's service is better. FYI we sat outside and we saw them do this 2x - sitting a party of 3 at 1 tiny table w little room to move - they can't move chairs too far out onto the sidewalk so it's cramped. We barely had room for all our stuff at 1 table for 2 of us. I can't imagine where 3 people put all their food.","Cool joint. If you have cold beer, TVs and a friendly staff that just wants you to enjoy yourself; You're good for 5  stars in my book. Oh, and you'll probably see a bunch of Cheesy Mac pics. That's because they're amazing and may have you hanging out at Halsey's more often. Cheers to The Halsey staff",We came here for brunch one Sunday and sat outside when the weather was still nice. Decided to come here after seeing that truffle mac & cheese. But to my surprise it was not on the brunch menu. Neither were the chicken deviled eggs that I had also came for. But it was fine I went for something else.So I opted for the regular mac & cheese with a side of brisket. It was decent enough what you expect of tavern food. The chopped brisket was delicious though put those two together and it was pretty good. My dining companion got the pancake burrito and judging from him eating the entire thing along with my food too I'm guessing he was happy with what he got and the overall experience.I got that kitchen sink bloody Mary and it was nasty af. Like I don't know what they were using but it had no flavor or more like a bitter taste to it I don't know.,"If you're A big fan of chicken wings Look no further. Tuesday nights are awesome they have a wing special plus trivia and the wings are actually pretty great. Not your small chicken wing special, they actually have pretty sizable wings and they're delicious.  They pair them with a Serata a Oli, wish they had some ranch but not a dealbreaker my girlfriend and I have been here a couple times and we really like it. They have outdoor seating as well as indoor seating and to top it off some old school video games if you're a fan. I play donkey Kong on Super Nintendo. What a throwback.Great little spot in Astoria and would recommend. Menu is your standard bar menu with some great twists on local options/cuisine. Dog friendly as well!",Halsey's Tavern
496,"I really wanted to like Sweet Chick. I've heard so many great things about this place but it may be overhyped because Nas is part owner. It's really dark when the sun goes down and you're forced to eat by candlelight - a tea light candlelight - that continuously kept going out as I tried to pour syrup in the dark. My boyfriend and I were seated at this cafeteria-like bench with other guests which was different, but I would prefer to sit at my own table. I could not decide on what I wanted to eat from the menu because as creative as the food names are, it's just overhyped Southern style food. The food came out before the drinks which is usually a slight irritation for me but I managed. The chicken was good but the waffles were ...not all that. Would I return? Umm no but I wouldn't urge someone not to try it. Maybe it'll be your thing.","It was OK. The wait was incredibly long, so don't go hungry. The food itself: We got the fried chicken and waffles, of course. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. I have a rule for myself: if I can make it better, then place is not worth a repeat visit. This is such a place.",I have to rewrite my review because I dined here this evening and was so disappointed in the service and the staffs uniform. I understand that this is a comfort food place but the hostess was wearing sweats and our servers stomach was out. I was a bit confused by the dress code. It's also hard to determine who's our server when they're all dressed so casual. This is the same problem with the way they talk. It's like they were acting like we were friends. I just think at this location they took casual to the next level. Our food was cold and the lack of service really made this an unfortunate experience. For that I have to go from 5 to 3 stars. -@agirlsgottaeatt,"Been to both locations and absolutely love their fried chicken and waffle. It's a perfect balance of sweet and savory. The waffle is light, warm, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. The chicken is fried to perfection. Crispy and juicy. Perfect seasoning. It comes with three types of butter. Sweet, savory, and plain. Their house bacon is great too.",Amazing chicken and waffles. Id recommend the chicken bucket.Maybe skip their General Tso's...the sauce they use for that is more akin to savory teriyaki than sweet/spicy General Tso's sauce. The pecan waffle is dope.,Good food AMAZING music selectiongood draft beer selection I am def coming back ! Also cute male bartenders,Sweet Chick
497,Been buying regularly from this place.. But from past couple of time the quality is going so down. Today it just crossed the limits. They gave no raita and salad and there was a peice of PLASTIC in the Kabab!!Be careful when you eat there. Shows how carelessly they prepare their food.,"First, I saw a long hair on carrot halwa while I was picking up my food then I came home expecting a good meal and guess what? I found nails in my food. 4 FINGER FUCKING NAILS! Are you serious? Naans were also not fully cooked. I specifically asked for well done with sesame seeds. I got my naan with no sesame seeds and not cooked properly. While I have been a customer for years, I've been very patient with staff for messing up almost every order in the last 6 months. Me and my family will not be ordering food from this place anymore.",This resturant food is delicious excellent. But here is no space to sit. Only take out not even delivery,"It was a chaotic scene with uncles respecting personal space, NOT!! Packed like a sardine can, I waited to convey my order while other voices shouted in Urdu and Bangla, ""Aik chai day do, aray meri naan kider hai, hum 10 min sai karan hai..""I ordered nihari, chicken karahi, beef Bihari kabab and raita.In retrospect I should've ordered x2 beef bihari kabab and 1 chicken kabab -- the Bihari kabab was so FRESH, HOT and DELICIOUS, each bite was worthsetting ablaze the hard palette... numerous timesThe staff were outnumbered by the contentious hangry crowd. Like true Chefs, they stood tall behind their stainless steel fortification and served their patrons with commendable customer service.***BEST CHAI IN NYC--best believe it","Its an awesome take away restaurant. Best Chicken kababs I had in NYC during my trip, and I tried kababs from 5 different highly rated restaurants. Tandoori fish takes a while to make but I would recommend that too. Big servings, great food and low prices. They give salad and yougurt generously. Soft and fluffy kababs, everything is great.","The saturation of Indian / Bangladeshi / Pakistani places in Jackson Heights is so heavy that establishments like Kebabish tend to get overlooked. There is a lot to appreciate at this no-nonsense joint and despite some highs and lows, Kababish is definitely worth checking out, especially for those with a curious palate. Like many spots in the neighborhood, this place would have the word ""dive"" written all over it. Approach the counter where a myriad of curries and stews, various meat appetizers await. Someone from the kitchen will take your order as you peruse their overhead menu of various classics and specials. The setup is more take out friendly than sit down, but casual meals aside, it's really all about preference here. I'll start with the things that I didn't like that much:* Their delivery packaging is suspect. Sometimes the plastic is wrapped so hard that it ends up being in the food.* I won't lie, I am not feeling a lot of their curries: chicken tikka masla is not strength, clearly. I would also throw their the gola beef kabab in the bunch.* Service is efficient, but it's also not great either. First timers might find this somewhat off-putting, especially to newbies to the cuisine.* Don't ask to use the restroom. Hold it.To the things I really enjoy:* Their seekh kebab is some of the best I've had.* Brains. Offal. Organ meats. You can have it all here. (See ""Tawa Kata-Kat"" on their specialty menu)* Big ups to the biryani here. The rice is as fragrant as all the other things from meats to eggs to condiments throughout the dish.* Their stuffed naan and samosas are strangely addicting. I always need more than one.No place is perfect and Kebabish is definitely in line with all the above. I am still finding myself coming here regularly with a craving for meats on skewers and heartily stuffed breads. The prices are still very affordable and I appreciate the non-pretentious vibe.",Kababish
498,"Thought it was a Good value of food and drinks. We went there on tuesday night . U get 16 wings on u first pitcher and only 8 after that ! Wrong advertising !!! and feels like the bartender maybe  doesn't like Chinese or he just do service like that. Not happy with his service but still need to pay 20% added automatically Pay attention when you pay the bill, they have been charged tips already.","You have to be a fortune teller and mathematician to understand the wings situation here on a Tuesday.You start with 8 wings each for a drink...any drink (or so they say), and then 4 additional wings there after only if you have another drink. My drink was beer both times, and still I only qualified for 8 wings first, and 4 wings after that. Not that I wanted more, but I was upset by the awkwardness of the whole situation.Server (or possible owner, manager?) immediately told me I couldn't order an additional 8, without first informing me what I would have to do to gain the additional 8. Even explaining the whole situation is confusing to explain, but I can say that this most recent experience was worse than the last, and I don't plan on coming back.I rather pay more money (50 cent wings if need be on a Tuesday) as long as it means you won't make your customers feel super weird afterwards. UGH, Dillingers - you have it all wrong :(",Wing night is on Tuesdays and an ABSOLUTE MUST. I am so happy my friends brought me here. Also had a pitcher of beer for $13- I feel like you really can't beat that. Will certainly be back. The wings with the Dillinger sauce were the best I've had in a really long time.Minus one star for the worst service I've ever gotten. Alex was MIA and when we found him he was super mean. Maybe he has a bad day? It was our first time so I don't personally know the guy but he was def on the nasty side.Will be back for wing night in the future.,"This place really is the best!!!! Not only is the staff SOOOO nice, the food and specials are amazing!!!! My favorite is the boneless bites, burger night and steak night! The $10 skirt steak on wednesdays is amazing! The flavor you will not find anywhere else! The burgers are $5 on Thursdays I believe, and they too are AMAZING!!!!! Came in here the other night and havent been in a while, still consistent!! This is one of the best places around and they have been around for a very long time. The only thing that was not good according to my husband was the chicken philly cheesesteak. He said that was bland and he wouldn't get that again.",I don't usually leave a bad review but this really deserves it The owner is disrespectful He has this specials to  get people to come back but once you there the service is horrible he is personally involved and running around stressed about how much you consume so he can cover his special he is looking at your order and harassing you to over spend so he can make up the price of his special please stay away you save yourself a bad experience,"So clearly this place is Scamming the General Public with False and Misleading advertising  . The Flyer attached says Wednesdays $10.00 Steaks , and they dont say on the flyer that each person in your party has to order another $10.00 of food. So The manager said either a soda and soup or  salad but Person. So they clearly are mis-leading the General Public and the guy who posted a year ago this Review is right on target!  That is not what is says on there flyer on the outside of their restaurant ! i would be Leary !  Proceed with caution BUYER Be aware !! POSTED BY Nick MistryLocal Guide  On Google · 23 reviewsA YEAR AGO -Good food but horrible dining experience. Don't believe the low ""special"" prices. The $10 steak ended up being $16 per person even though we met the $10 minimum spending requirement per person. I asked what the sides are with the steak. They said you can choose either mashed potatoes or vegetables. So I chose vegetables. When the bill came, they added $3 for a side of vegetables, per person. Then they added $2.00 up-charge because the $20 in other purchases were appetizers. So, a $10 steak night turned into a $60 bill for two. And the waiter acknowledged this was a crappy thing to do. So guess what. Screw you. Never going back. Me or my friend. You want to nickel and dime your customers, go ahead. See how long you last.",Dillingers Pub & Grill
499,"This is by far the worst korean restaurant I've ever been to-- the food is terrible, and the customer service is worst. Can feel the negativity and the impulsiveness when asked for something and very violent with bringing the food. Me and my mom had lunch there, we finished up and paid the money. The owner at the counter took our money and our tips (7$). We thought it was too less so we left 2$ at the table. A few seconds after we exited, the waitress angrily barged face to face onto us with so much anger asking us to explain why we left only two dollars tip. First of all, a waiter/ waitress is not entitled to ask that, second of all, even if someone doesn't tip you, you should be okay with that. A waitress is supposed to do her waitressing irregardless of the tipping. (I don't usually review but this was way too much for me not to write a review)","Ended in this place because it's the nearest and I have to say I am not coming back.  I. short you can but $30 of meat and feed the 4 people and so much more.  The food was flavorless, the service was ok but to me, it is not a bbq place.  On top of the mediocre service, we were charge for something that wasn't serve, good thing we caught it cause it wa $30","I've been here several times and I wasn't sure about it's fair for left reviews from I didn't like this place food. Maybe I am a too picky person or this place food was not good. I never been this place at day time, always I went to this place for dinner at late night. My friend told me to this place chef wasn't korean at night time and this place good at daytime. Maybe that's why I didn't like this place food but almost korean restaurants chefs aren't korean. I've tired few dishes and that wasn't good than I thought. My friend know I didn't like this place and stopped asking me to go eat this place even we hadn't choice go to anywhere for eat late night.","Came here for some late-night eats -- I've never heard of the place, so I decided to give it a try; We ordered Galbi, budaejigae, ramen, and pork belly. Everything was amazing! The flavors of the meat were unlike anything I've had before! Because of the first experience, we went again within the same week! 10/10 would recommend","We do not recommend this place. We went again in August and their food and service quality dropped significantly. The waiter spilled the whole cup of water when we sat down and we got wet, he just said sorry and walked away, his apology was not sincere. We ordered the seafood pancake, sol gom tang (ox bone soup) and a beef short rib stew. The seafood pancake as you can see in the picture is soggy and has only a few small pieces of seafood. We thought they brought out a scallion pancake instead and had to confirm with the waiter. The ox bone soup was good but it has very little noodles and beef pieces. The beef short rib stew is overly sweet and is way too pricy for the amount of ribs they give. Overall they're too cheap with their ingredients and not worth the price you pay. We used to love coming here because their flavor and service were much better. There used to be an old Korean waitress who makes us feel like home and refills our side dishes. Now we won't be going back anymore.","Not my first time here.  This visit was the best out of the previous 4 times I've been here.  Tends to be a little inconsistent but like I said this was a perfect visit and wanted to give them a good review for a good job. We had the seafood pancake appetizer, bbq-ox tongue and bbq- bulgogi.   Everything was done well this visit especially with the seafood pancake.  Crunchy and crispy outside and filled with seafood and scallions inside.  Service was great.  The waiters and the lady (probably in charge of the kitchen) made sure the bbq was cooked right.  Side dishes cleansed the palate well.  I left the restaurant wanting more.  That was a first.  Please keep up the good work!!",Hae Woon Dae
500,"The chicken was cooked perfectly and the food was delicious. The atmosphere wasn't super memorable, but it was also 3pm on a Monday, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯","Food was gross fajita meat had absolutely no flavor yet so much grease ugh, shrimp pasta thing I had was eh delivery driver had no change it was just all a mess.","I ordered a chicken burrito without cheese and sour cream over the phone during the lunch hour.. the hosts told me it would be ready in tens minutes.. and it just about was!  Thanks for being speedy.  When I arrived to the restaurant the host and bartender were very friendly and kind.  The host even read the order to me as I sat at the bar and I confirmed no cheese/no sour cream. Walked home, put my bags down, put ice in my cup, poured my beverage, sat down opened up my meal took about two bites and realized the chef put cheese on my burrito.. and it was melted so I couldn't even pull it off.  The restaurant wasn't even packed so the chef couldn't have been overwhelmed.  NO QUESO is one less step he had to worry about but still failed the mission.. now I'm still hungry and won't be returning to that spot. The burrito also seemed very oily and as did the guac and salad. I have no issue traveling for good food.  Chipotle is not an option.","Wow!  Fresh, fresh, fresh!  The starting guacamole with chips was great.  My wife had a grilled steak salad with avocado, and they did not hold back on the fresh avocado.  The mixed greens and tomatoes were super fresh too.My wife and I shared Sangria, which was just right.  I was told that the owner himself made it.I had a steak burrito bowl and again it was filled with very fresh vegetables, greens, tasty sliced steak and more fresh avocado!  This joint rocks!  Better and less expensive than Chipotle!Also the Cantina had super service -- polite and prompt.  Julian was attentive, but not intrusive.  We will be back!Happy customer.",Love this place. Staffs are friendly and also the food is great. The atmosphere is coolService was really attentive and friendly . The best food I had is holy guacamole and I also like their cocktails. Guacamole- was great and very satisfying . Will definitely hit this place up when I'm in this area.,"Im not one to write reviews and i had to re download this app just to comment about this place. ITS A MUST READ, the food is AMAZING. The drinks ARE AMAZING . The vibe is fantastic CHANO  is the bomb. I recommend the tamarind frozen margarita.  The coconut mojito. The prices are fair. The watermelon margarita you can't go wrong at this place . So just come to chanos cantina",Chano's Cantina
501,"I used to come to Sushi Yasu, but never since my last visit a few months ago.  At that time, the chef served a smoked-salmon sushi as part of my sushi platter. The smoked salmon was too salty for sushi and quite not deserving a sushi topping. And it must have been from just a cheap smoked salmon package you can buy anywhere. I felt chef's choice disrespectful. Did he want to cut cost? If regular salmon was not available, he should have used other seafood.","Stopped in for some sushi take out on a Saturday night, whole place was empty, still waited about 30 min for my food. My son took a bite of his crepe that we had gotten from the place upstairs, idk if it was the owner but came out and very rudely told him no outside food. I understand it's a business but there's no such thing as customer service in this place. I will definitely never be back here again. No wonder this place is so empty. The sushi was okay. Rice was mushy and soft and the salmon did not taste fresh.","Had been here a while back and it was good. However, today I had the $80 Omikase and it was disappointing. Chef Yasu did not say what was already sauced and what you had to put your own soy sauce and wasabi. Also, some of the added flavors and textures did not go together well.","This is one of my husband and I's go-to places for sushi in Forest Hills. It is tucked away on the bottom floor of a two story shopping complex. The wait staff are always very friendly and attentive. Our tea and water is constantly refilled. The sushi melts in your mouth. It is perfectly fresh and we have always liked everything that we order here. Last night, we decided to try something new and both ordered the sushi regular. It was tasty and just the right portion of food. It came with a green salad, seaweed salad, or miso soup. My husband and I both got the miso soup. It is delicious here and definitely not too salty.We missed it, but they have great happy hour specials here, including $6 sake and $18 pitcher of Sapporo.We will definitely be back!!","I'm part Japanese and have eaten at a lot of sushi restaurants in the NYC area over the last 10 years.  Most are gone now, but Sushi Yasu has been around for double digit years, likely for good reason.Sushi Yasu could be literally translated as ""Cheap sushi"", so I was a bit skeptical of the quality when I first walked in.  Instead, I was pleasantly surprised.This place is tucked away in the basement of a commercial complex on Austin street, and I would have never known it was there unless someone told me about it beforehand.I had the mid-level Omakase for $60.  Every piece seemed to have a quality to it that went above and beyond expectations.  It seemed as though every piece was selected based on it's unique flavor and texture.  The selections were further given dimension by the juxtaposition of modern and traditional styles.  And of course, each selection was fresh with no fishy smell.  Even the miso soup was rich and flavorful.  I've had Omakase costing $80 or more at other places which was comparable to this one.  Oh, and the wasabi was real.  Not the stuff from a tube.  No charge for green tea was a plus!On top of that, the chef was a nice guy, and he told me about his background and even cracked a few cheesy jokes.  Everyone here speaks Japanese so natives should feel right at home.The restaurant itself is pretty plain and won't stand out as anything super trendy.  The food is Michelin star quality, though I imagine it would be tough to earn one given Michelin's emphasis on presentation.I recommend anyone looking for a great, no frills sushi place in the area to check this one out.  I'd even recommend those living in Manhattan to make the trek out to Queens.  You won't be disappointed.","Sushi Yasu is a surprisingly good sushi restaurant in a Queens strip mall.  The sushi is notably above average, despite how the place looks, which isn't to say bad by any means, but just unassuming and in a strip mall. The service is always efficient and polite.",Sushi Yasu
502,"I don't care how good your food turns out, it is illegal to have a credit card minimum of $25.00.  You can only do credit card minimums up to $10.00.  Don't give me attitude about it; I dropped $20.00 on pierogis.","Probably the worst hospitality in Astoria. Nasty from the moment we walked in. The place has more rules than a prison. Giant sign on the $25 credit card minimum, which is absurd to begin with but fine, but surprise you at the end that tip is cash only. Well that's too bad for them, not that a tip was merited because they were nasty the entire time. It's great food and a very cool decor but the staff and rules ruin the experience.","Excellent food at RIDICULOUS PRICES. Menu prices for potato spaetzle with sauerkraut & bacon, and a grilled kielbasa: $15.75 + 8.75, which is INSANE as is. Oh, but wait, if you order for pickup, they charge another $1.50. NEVER AGAIN.","I am 100% Czech, and can tell you, this restaurant is 100% authentic! The food  is as good as any classic Czech restaurant in Prague. The best place in New York City for authentic central European food! I highly recommend the schnitzel and the Svíčková. Dobrou chuť!","Came here with a ticket from the Queens Beer book. Upon walking in, I noticed this place looks almost like a hunting lodge. It has animal skin hanging on the walls and a triangular roof. We were promptly approached by a waitress to take our drink orders. I started with a BrouCzech-Dark. This was so delicious. It's a dark ale that sort of looks like a stout upon first glance. It was so good that I ordered another one.To eat I had the chicken schnitzel with French fries. My friend ordered the chicken kabob. The food arrived piping hot, and it smelled amazing. The schnitzel tasted fresh, and the kabobs were well-seasoned and tender. For dessert, my friend and I split the homemade apple strudel. I am kicking myself for not ordering the ice cream with it. The strudel was the perfect end to our meal.With room from one more beer, I ordered the Krusovice. This was a very well balanced lager that was lighter in color as compared to the Brou-Czech. It was yummy and curbed my appetite! The service was fantastic. It seemed like there was only one waitress serving everyone but she was efficient and friendly. I would definitely come back!","The beer, the spaetzle with bacon, the venison feast every year, the homemade fluffy, moist dumplings. What can I say about Koliba? My sister introduced this amazing restaurant to me and it is the most amazing little cozy ""just for the locals"" kind of place that make me proud to call Astoria my home. I love their beer selections, too. Be sure to chase it all down with their homemade apple strudel, some of the best in the city.",Koliba
503,"I always come here with friends for lunch and dinner for the past 3 years, but won't be ever coming back again. Called in asking when their last seating was and the girl said 12:30am. We got here right when it turned 12:31am and they refused to seat us even when they have half the restaurant still packed and eating. ACTUALLY, the two girls grabbed menus and were ready to seat us, but the guy rushed over and said ""no, take out only"". I told them we would eat fast and leave, still he refused to seat us. TERRIBLE SERVICE. WON'T EVER BE COMING BACK!! There are multiple Thai restaurants around the area with much better customer service.","First time eating at the recommended restaurant: Sunday lunch time. Service was fast, although the servings were a little on the small side, comparing to other similar restaurants. Pricing is decent, around 15-20 per head should you want to order dish for each person.  I'd come back for the second time to see if everything's the same  possibly weekend, and dinner time.","I wasnt impressed with this place. For their prices, I could get better thai food for cheaper prices. The food tasted like the typical thai food at a viet/thai place. Appetizer portions are small like their calamari. It's only a handful for $6.50 and crust isnt to my liking.","Updating my review since my last encounter after management reached out and I finally came here again. Came here Tuesday night and it wasn't too busy so we were sat down immediately. Servers were prompt and extremely friendly. Hands down, their tomyum soup is to die for. It's really a must every time you come here if you're a fan of spicy soup. The portion of their entrees are very generous and well affordable. One main reason why I prefer spicy shallot over other Thai restaurants in the area is because the food here are never bland or too salty in my experiences as oppose to its competitors. If you are ever in the area, make sure to check this gem out. Although there are many Thai restaurants around the area, you are definitely missing out if you do not give this place a chance.","The Spicy Shallot was THEE go-to place for takeout amongst the summer camp staff I worked with while in New York. It really fueled us for those long hours that we put in with the kids. The shumai dumplings? Bomb. The crab rangoon? Bomb. The seafood fried rice? Bomb. The dynamite chicken? You guessed it, bomb. But my absolute favorite thing from the menu to order was the Thai Coffee. It's so sweet, creamy, and flavorful. The large size packs enough caffeine to power a small army! I'm so glad that they deliver.  I really need to take a visit and dine in one of these days.",My all time favorite Asian fusion restaurant ! I love the lengthy menu because they're so many options. The Thai iced tea is made to perfection! Must try sushi: MONSTER ROLL! Delicious!,Spicy Shallot
504,This Resturant is by far the worst establishment I have ever been too. I was extremely happy to finally have a Colombian Resturant close to home. Right after it opened I took my family there for dinner and it was the worst experience ever we waiting 1hr an 15 minutes for our order an it came completely wrong they forgot my sons order an the food was horrible. My daughters chicken tasted like fried fish it was not worth the $100 we spent. I was told the cook changed an the owner was actually cooking an made improvements. What a lie! Yesterday I went back an I ordered a arepa with cheese an eggs. The eggs were watery and the arepa tasted spoiled. Our coffees were cold as well. I called the waitress over an explained to her that the arepa tasted as thou the cheese was spoiled and she said her boss was there an she was going to speak with her. A few minutes later the waitress came back with a confused face an said the owner saidThe arepas were made fresh last night an she doesn't know what to tell you the arepas Were made the night before fresh. I asked if I could kindly speak with the manager an if I could have the check. The waitress went back spoke with her the owner an what appeared to be the owners family walked around the Resturant spoke amongst their selves and never came out. I toldThe waitress please just give me the check I need to leave. The waitress came out an said the owner saidShe can take $5 of the bill. I told the waitress money was not the point. The food was spoiled I asked to speak with management an no one was concerned enough to speak with a customer. An I never received a apology! On top of all of this the a/c only works in one area modThe Resturant so you have be seated near that area or melt! This place is completely unprofessional. If a customer would like to speak with someone regarding their experience as a proud owner and professional I would think receiving constructive criticism is part of your job. I will never go back to this horrible place.,"What kind of place puts Russian dressing on chicken and calls it sauce? Cheap store bought condiments don't count as sauce. The chicken would've probably been fine otherwise (not amazing but fine). I have no idea whose idea it was to douse chicken in Russian dressing. It's crazy to have customers pay for a salad dressing they can buy on a shelf in stop & shop and to try to pass it off as a ""special sauce"".","The name of the business really intrigued me. I had amazing arepas when i went to DC so when I saw this I HAD to go in. Unfortunately, I wasn't very impressed :(. I expected a large variety of arepas but they only have a few options (maybe 5-6) and they're all pretty similar; chicken with cheese, beef with cheese, guac with cheese, cheese alone etc. Nothing out of the ordinary. I expected a unique range of different types from a place called AREPAlicious. Anywho, we ended up ordered a few chicken and beef arepas with a plantain stuffed with cheese and chicken. The plantain was good and the arepas were okay. What bothered me was the service. It took some time to be acknowledged when we arrived and when I asked for more sauce I was told that it was a limit of 1 sauce for every two arepas. Now don't get me wrong, I understand limiting sauce for those who take advantage but you're telling me that for every TWO arepas, I can only have 1 small sauce that isn't even filled fully? That doesn't really make sense. The server stated if I wanted extra sauce, I would have to pay. Sorry arepalicious :( not impressed.","Came here with one of my buddies, and I throughly enjoyed my visit. After passing by this place for quite some time it was nice being able to go inside. The place was arranged very nicely. In fact, the aesthetics beat my expectation. I loved the vibes with the Spanish music, and the waitresses had on red uniforms which captured the Colombian cafe feels. I tried the half rotisserie chicken with rice and beans, but unfortunately the chicken was kind of dry. But to be fair, this spot isn't known for that so I wouldn't judge the quality of the food based on my review. In short, the vibes of this place was very nice, the food was good, service was great, and I'll probably come back to try their arepas. Coming from an Ecuadorian/Colombian household, I enjoyed being there and would most likely visit again.","I love that this place has parking in the rear - def. a must for me, especially in this area. I got the cone which was delicious, however the actual meat was less than warm which i found a bit weird.My friend got an arepa (i forgot the name) but it was also less than warm.The fried chicken was delicious but the tostones were not crisp or warm. Overall, A-OK. I'd like to try a bit more of the menu options and re-do my review. I'd suggest trying for yourself. The Lemonade I got was also very tasty.","Delicious food, poor service. We ordered water before we ordered our meal and didn't get it until after we got our food. The waitress who we asked went on break without saying anything so we had to ask another waitress who seemed confused that she was serving us now too. We ordered the Colombian platter which was delicious and filling! Again, we tried waving someone down for a water refill and it was difficult! I was surprised because it wasn't crowded. It was a Sunday afternoon and there were tables empty. We enjoyed the food though. I hope the service gets better, it helps business! I'm really big on drinking water, it was also hot. Yummy Colombian food though!",Arepalicious
505,"Ever since 66 closed in Flushing, the search for a new Taiwanese pork chop over rice started. The food here is pretty damn good and not that expensive either. They have noodle soups as well, and I also saw oyster pancakes on the menu. I ordered the stinky tofu and it lives up to the name. I really enjoyed this dish, in fact I finished it all by myself. I love finding these gems outside of Flushing, with parking not being something to stress about. They offer ayce hotpot as well. I saw the table next to ours order that option. The hotpot was in what appears to be a cast iron pot. They bring the sauce to you, so there's no sauce station. Not sure what the sauce selection looks like. The price per person is $24.99. Will likely try this next time. The staff was friendly, but seemed a bit lazy. Took a while for them to realize that they seated us without menus. There was only 1 other group in the restaurant too so it was a little surprising. They did apologize for their mistake though.","Spacious restaurant seats approx 50 or so. The menu offers Taiwanese night market items such as stinky tofu, noodle soup, pork blood cake (sorry I don't know the English name) and I noticed other yelpers already posted the menu.U can check in via yelp for a free soda.

DEFINITELY give this place a try if you are in the neighborhood!","I had lunch here with a couple of friends on a weekday. It was fairly empty during this time. This place is very cozy with only a handful of small tables, so it's not for groups. I found the prices here to be very reasonable - entrees are slightly cheaper than other Thai places in the neighborhood by a dollar or two. We kept it simple and had the Pad Thai and the Pad Kee Mao. Our noodle dishes were fresh and had good flavor. However, the portion sizes here are small. That explains the lower price. After I left I was still pretty hungry, so I grabbed a snack elsewhere. Don't go here if you want a filling meal.","Consistent, good quality authentic Thai food. More like 3.5 stars. Just not on the higher levels of some other Thai restaurants.  Not one that I'd drive a distance to.",Tommy Thai
507,The location is small but the food is stand-out authentic Spanish food with authentic Spanish wines and beer (give Estrella Galicia a try),"No bueno. Was looking for a nice after work spot that had happy hour specials. Walked in and the place was completely empty except for the staff that worked there. The only specials they had was on the food. I had white sangria which was decent. Ordered the peppers stuffed with crab meat. The were not good at all. The stuffing had the consistency of cottage cheese and it was more like imitation crab salad with lots of mayonnaise. For the main course, ordered the stuffed lobster. The stuffing had a burnt egg flavor and was just nasty. I used the side of rice as a chaser to the flavor because for $40 I was not letting it go to waste. This was definitely the worst $80 Ive ever ver spent.","This was my second visit, my previous one was about a year prior. I was very disappointed in the service it was very slow, our food took over an hour to come out meanwhile tables that were seated after us received their orders first. The waiter did not come up to us to explain the delay or anything. I even had to ask for a water refill couple of times. When we finally got our food, it was cold and over cooked. I was very pleased with my  first visit and wanted to come back ever since, however my friends and I were very disappointed in taste, service and quality.","Amazing -- more detailed review to follow, but tonight we two had a phenomenal tapas dinner. We ordered 4 portions to start. The first two arrived in 5 minutes: shrimp and asparagus (ESPÁRRAGOS A LA PLANCHA).  (There was excellent garlic bread for sopping up le juice.0 They were followed by potato croquets + ham, and stuffed mushrooms with crabmeat (this last item was merely good).   Later, beef empenadas and some potato dish that my wife had eaten in Barcelona). These were, without a doubt, the best tapas I have ever had. They beat those in my former favorite Lower East Side place, and also beat a very good place in Jackson Heights.The service was excellent. There were approx. 3 people who served our table. Each visited us at least twice. They were super-attentive.The restaurant is close to the movie theaters...what a great date night!","Cafe Ole is a pleasant Spanish restaurant in Long Island City. It's a small place with friendly and efficient service.  Food was served literally in 15 minutes or so- and I'm talking almost every dish.  Which leads me to believe a lot of stuff is either reheated or partially pre-prepared.  Not everything was great but the food was all decent to good.  The garlic shrimp, usually a favorite of mine at Spanish restaurants, we're a bit bland and soft.  The patatas bravas were somewhat underwhelming in flavor and not at all crispy, but semi-mushy.  Still, these dishes weren't bad.  And I know this isn't sounding like a glowing endorsement so far as far as my food descriptions are going, but the rest of the food was better, including a steak appetizer and the grilled calamari.  I will be back!Oh, and the bartender was very friendly and recommended a cocktail that he created, which was delicious.  So if you like drinks, ask the bartender for some suggestions!","A friend of mine invite me for dinner in Astoria and cafe ole was a good option, deco was nice and great for a lovely date.

Poor form, never going back and will advise everyone I know not to as well.","Used to love this place and came here all the time - sort of local watering hole for my bf and his friends. But, came here yesterday for some football (only one TV showing the Jets btw) and was totally thrown off by the rude bartender and then the dramatic situation which ensued. First off, I want to make it clear that the way the bartender (tall male) spoke to us was entirely unacceptable regardless of circumstance. Dude - you are in the service industry and it's part of your job to accommodate your patrons - get it together!!!! The rudeness and language used to address us was insane, especially considering it was 12PM in the afternoon (it's not like we were a bunch of sloppy drunks at 2AM). I've never heard a bartender or waiter speak to a customer like that in my life! Plus, talking down to women? Not okay. I arrived with my bf and three friends (two guys and one 8 month pregnant friend)... there were only four chairs at our table, so I pulled one up from the bar. The bartender came over almost immediately saying ""someone is bringing over other chairs for you to use. These chairs are for people at the bar""... of course I immediately said ""sorry!"", but upon further inspection, I see that the chairs at our table (about 24 inches from the bar) are the exact same chair, plus there were five empty chairs at the bar where I was taking ONE chair from... if someone was coming to replace the chair, then why couldn't they just put that replacement chair at the bar? I don't get it. Also, I wanted a seat NOW, not in five minutes when this replacement chair arrived (hey, I was tired!). Then, the bartender starts YELLING at my pregnant friends husband (unbeknownst to me, five minutes before my arrival, my guy friend and the bartender had the SAME EXACT interaction.... why can't we just take this chair and replace the one at the bar?)... I don't know why this bartender just went off for NO REASON!! All I did was pull over a freaking chair to sit in! We're customers! Not to mention, my friend is pregnant... have some tact and respect. So obviously, as a group, we decide to leave (sorry Blackbird's... after 9 years of loyal patronship from a group of 20 frat bros and their wives, we're officially saying: it's you, not us)... then, unfortunately, my friends husbands went to push the chair, in an attempt to be dramatic, and it tipped over and fell on the floor!! Of course this was the worst possible thing that could have happened... needless to say, testosterone was now flowingggggg. Sucks that thus unreasonable situation happened and set him off. Next thing I know, another employee starts yelling at my friend, then a man in a hat w greyish longer hair and another employee run outside behind us, they're all yelling at us, chasing us down the street.... we were leaving!!! Your staff was rude to us the second we walked in that day - we didn't want to stay, and knocking over the chair was clearly and accident! Get it together!!! It was just such an unfortunate situation, that didn't even need to happen... all due to a bartender not wanting to share an unused chair with a patron. Sick.",Nice cozy pub with awesome atmosphere. The food was also very delicious . Will definitely be coming back soon.,"I was in search of a Wednesday day night wing special . I know a spot for Monday , Tuesday and now I needed one for Wednesday. So of course I got in yelp and Bammm blackbird appears. So I went. They had draft beer for happy hours but I am soooo not a beer drinker . So I ordered a drink with stoking vodka lemonade and blue curacao . Man that drunk taste like pure lemonade with bum vodka in it. The price was 9 dollars for that crap . Needless to say I didn't order another .The wings were awesome . They taste just as good as the ones I get from my Tuesday spot Dillingers . Nice crispy and not fried too long . The sauce is what is needed for all buffalo wings in my opinion . Sooo good I can barely explain . Please go on a Wednesday to taste these savory wings. Just remember Wednesday is a cash only day ! Wings are half price on Wednesday's so that's only a whopping $7. You know they are good when ya bd says ""it taste like I had them before!"" I bet greedy!Service was quick and too the point . Bar seats fill up quickly .","Those wings! After doing a search I came across blackbirds winning an award for the best wings in Queens. My husband and I stopped by on a Friday night to give them a try. Cozy bar with lots of seating. We were escorted to a table in the back and ordered the spinach dip and buffalo wings to start. Both were out of this world! The spinach dip was just as I like it, thicker cheesier consistency. The wings were super crispy even while drenched in buffalo sauce. After that we ordered a burger and the fish tacos. I would have preferred the fish to be cut up then breaded, vs large filets of fried fish (made it harder to eat) but the flavors were totally there. The crowd was awesome, and the music was great. Download the touch tunes app to play songs from your phone!",Blackbird's Bar & Restaurant
509,"I gave 3 stars because the falafel was good but I ordered the avocado wrap basically avocado gyro with veggies.  If you look at the picture they gave me about half of a bag of lettuce.  The pita was cold, cold meaning tasted like it was in the freezer after they wrapped it.  The sauce had no flavor.   I basically ate the avocado and some of the bag of lettuce.  Threw a lot of it out.","We've ordered takeout from here before, and it's been decent, but unfortunately the last time we ordered (a few months ago), my husband contracted severe food poisoning and ended up in the hospital. He had ordered the Loukaniko and ended up sick a few hours after eating it. I'm not sure if this is because the meat was sitting out all day or if there was a contamination. I'm a vegetarian, so I got the Halloumi Cheese in a pita wrap, and I fortunately didn't get sick from it. We used to think this was a pretty good place but unfortunately we will not be ordering from here again.","I placed an order on Uber Eats and after waiting an hour, they cancelled my order and told me they were about to close so they couldn't do anything to help me. Bad service. It was my first time trying to order from this restaurant and I won't bother trying to order from here again","Ordered online through Yelp tonight and didn't even know this place existed. Thank you Yelp for bringing me to my new Greek spot. Delicious and quick delivery. I got the Souvlaki chicken pita with onions, feta, and tomato. Delicious!!I'll be ordering again.","Used to love this place when it first opened. We ordered from them every other day basically. Once a restaurant gets comfortable with you, they start seeing what they can get away with. Have ordered takeout and paid for extra sauces, only to find they didn't put any. And then it became overpriced for LESS food. They barely put anything into what used to be my favorite, pork souvlaki platters.. and last I checked, the price was pushing $20 for the same plate with items conveniently missing. When the place first opened it was $12. I get that they need to make rent, but I haven't gone there in almost a year now because they treat customers like customers are privileged to be treated like garbage. They yell at you on the phone, yell at you in person too, and the deals they provide on seamless are a joke. ($5 off for orders over $60, that's basically 4 gyros.)","Every Monday I do catering for my team of 40. This week I wanted to try something different. Sliders and wings are great but become mundane. With that said, decided to try this restaurant using ezcater.com. WHAT A HIT!!! From the minute the delivery arrived it was top notch. They organized the food, brought linens and the gentleman that delivered was just extremely pleasant. Now onto the good stuff, the food! This was my first time trying Greek so I was little concerned about my choices but, let's just say, there wasn't a single tray left with food. Everything was delicious. Everything arrived temperature appropriate and each tray was so heavy in flavor. So glad I decided to try something new. This will be added to my regular rotation now.",3Greeks Grill
510,"An ayce sushi spot by Queens Center Mall. I honestly didn't have high expectations going into it and Id say it barely met that. The price point for lunch is great at $16.99. You can't really beat that anywhere but there's no sashimi. There's also limited sashimi for dinner which is the same price at other sushi spots. Pieces of sushi were sized just right and not too big which I appreciated! Quality of fish and variety were on the lower end and nothing to rave about. Some of the servers were a little rude and was just how the other Yelp reviews described it. One of the customers actually made a scene while leaving and screamed at the waiters. Supposedly when he asked for napkins, the server just threw it at him. There are better ayce sushi spots out there and I don't think I'll be returning to this one.","2.5 stars? The staff was polite and the venue is spacious and clean, so I'll bump it up.Lunch is $15.99 (soda included), which is a good deal if you are looking for a filling meal. Salad:- Pickled cucumbers and kimchee were made Taiwanese style. Decent.Hot foods:-The yakitori was tasty, but I did not expect the pieces of chicken to be so big... struggled to finish this in the end so be careful with how many skewers you order!-Age tofu was just lightly fried tofu... nothing special. skip.-Miso eggplant was very oily... did not taste the miso. skip.-Spicy tuna dumpling was interesting, probably one of the better hot dishes.-Beef negimaki was not bad, pieces were tender and the sauce was slightly sweet.-Miso soup was average, similar to other AYCE sushi joints.Sushi:- sashimi was not available on the lunch menu.- Ordered salmon, tuna, and eel sushi. First round of sushi was meh. Thin slices of fish and the rice was very hard with no flavor. Tasted like old, leftover rice. maybe we came too early?- Waited a while before ordering a few more pieces of salmon. This time, the cuts of fish were thicker and seemed much more fresh... rice was only marginally better (not as dry) but still disappointing. - eel & avocado roll was okay. The avocado was very creamy and helped to disguise the poor quality of the rice. We left feeling a bit disappointed at the quality of the food, but if you're shopping at QC, I guess it would be worth it to walk over here instead of eating food from the food court.","This is an all you can eat sushi place. The menu has so much to choose from. Dessert is extra cost. Soda is included. We tried many different items since we were a large group and they struggled to remember which end of the table ordered what. The food: -Kalbi was flavorful and a favorite in the group. -The sashimi comes as a platter order, not individual pieces. My salmon sashimi was frozen in the middle and that was gross. I was told to just wait for it to come to room temp...-There is a menu full of special rolls - they were good-The no rice roll was also a favorite. I didn't try it. It had spam and something else I can't remember.","If you're looking for all you can eat sushi on a budget, go to Rakuzen! For only $17/person, my cousins and I got to chow down on sushi and other foods on the menu (soup, noodles, etc) for cheap! The inside is quite spacious and service is fast. Highly recommend!","Disappointed going back. Pros: sushi is decent. Flavor of cooked foods are really great. Except for indo fried rice- lacking in flavor comes with 2 pieces of shrimp. Cons: TLDR; They are cheap and incompetent, ruined our evening of celebration. Cons: service was poor. Management blamed it on how they are new. Understandable- but not the most pleasant. They were stalling to take our food order at first and kept pushing for our drink order. I thought maybe they needed time until our server was ready to take our order form. But they just kept coming to ask about drinks. We get out food, we are enjoying our meal. Like I said: food quality is pretty decent. We decided to order everything we think we can fit and finish in the first round of ordering-- because we predicted that they will be slow in service. Saved us trying to flag them down for additional order inputs. We finish 90% of everything we ordered. Didn't finish the bland fried rice but it was a decent appetizer and we ate most of it. Didn't finish as in CLEAN OFF LICKED THE PLATE EMPTY LIKE A DOG the plate for some Kani salad and other looser items and LOW VALUE items. I wish I took a picture to show you guys lol. We have literally NEVER had ANY issues with other AYCE sushi or hot pot or bbq places. It's AYCE and we are not wasteful. We leave some left over as any normal people will at any AYCE establishment. We don't have plates full of items that look like it can be fresh. We ask for the check after 3 servers ignored us- 1 looked at me walked towards me, and then continued to walk past me. We couldn't flag down our tables server- we didn't even know who was assigned to our table. Finally someone comes: we ask for the check, she responds ""can you eat more"" We are put off and confused- eat more what? Eat more seaweed? There's like 5 pieces left in the bowl. Eat more fried rice? It tasted bad. Eat more sushi? We finished all of our sushi. Fine- we nibble on what we have left.We ask a different server for the check. She comes back with the bill and asks ""can you eat more?"" ????????? ??????? Eat more WHAT? Literally so ridiculous just f**king charge us for the extra food if you're gonna be stingy or just don't open an all you can eat place. Manager came to apologize about the server not telling us Apple Juice costed extra. Ok. Print out a picture of a clean plate if nobody is allowed to leave until you finish the food.  GO TO SUSHI ISLAND. OR TOMO SUSHI ACROSS THE STREET. they're not AYCE but you might as well just enjoy better food and service. Or go to Akinos(?) I've heard good things about them. Plenty of good sushi and Asian food in Elmhurst. Plenty of better AYCE in flushing. Their AYCE is a misleading gimmick and disappointing.","Loved the lunch All You Can Eat special. It's not too expensive and there is a good selection on the menu. The staff were very accommodating and you can tell they were very focused on delivering good service. Food was great! My boyfriend and I were so stuffed and satisfied by the end. They offer free soda but I would advise against it. Don't want to fill stomach with soda. We tried almost all the apps and the a la carte sushi, as well as a few very tasty rolls. The fish tasted fresh, I really enjoyed the octopus. We are definitely coming back to try the dinner menu!",Rakuzen Elmhurst
511,"Come here if you want to pay to eat HAIR in your food . I went here for lunch with my coworker and had a HORRIBLE experience. Based on the reviews I've read , I came into this place with hopes of great tasting food however the service was extremely Bad . We sat down to eat , was offered stale refried chips and watery salsa. The steak tacos were delicious until we found hair in them .Disgusting ! I paid for my order but refused to pay for the hairy ones & this woman  had the nerve to try to make us pay anyways . The cooks need to wear hairnets & the cashier needs a better attitude. No tip . Rude lady . I regret not taking a pic but I was too disgusted I wanted to run out of there .",The food doesn't come out so fresh and it seems like not a lot of care was taken into consideration.,"This restaurant has nasty customer service, the people are rude and disrespectful. The cashier who takes your order at the register is beyond disrespectful. The food is nasty and I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!! Save your money and go somewhere with better customer service and better tasting food.","Some places are my friend, and others are my NEMESISAgassi's soccer skills are no match for his TENNISESAnd when it comes to society, I'm the one who MENACESAnd if you're want Cemitas, time to go to GENESIS!What.This place seems to have an invisible touch. It reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart. It's that good.Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel own this place and I'm amazed that they get along well enough to put out some pretty delicious Mexican noms. I'm not crazy about the drinks here but the service is wonderful and it's open late night on a Saturday night and you can't really ask for more than that.Now how about the incredible Cemita sandwich. It was under $10 and filling and tasty and served to me 5 minutes before they closed, so I'm really pretty happy with this place on my second visit. Five stars? Easy.Happy to be review #101 of this, too.It's within walking distance of all the good stuff in Jackson Heights. So is my Dad's gigolo agency.","This little spot does Uber Eats late at night, which earns me an extra star. More importantly, it has mouth-watering tortas filled with fresh avocado, tomato, and Oaxaca cheese. I got the pollo asada torta with chicken. It was really fresh and came with fresh limes - yum! A nice replica of comfort Mexican street food.I also ordered the chilate de pollo soup. It was flavorful and filled with lots of veggies that soaked up the broth.","Food here is great. Never disappoints. My fav is there Shrimp Burrito in a Bowl. The shrimp are big and grilled. YUM!! They're burgers & fries are also good. Juicy and tasty, and their quesadilla is very satisfying. I order from here often and it always does the trick! Oh and they're natural juices are recommended too, I usually get the Kale, pineapple, beets and apple one and even my 6yr old likes it.",Tacos Y Jugos Genesis
512,What a terrible experience. The reason servers are tipped is to make sure they actually have a reason to do a good job. Food was BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD.,So sad we ate here. It was a mistake. I don't understand how you could be such a horrible restaurant and not know it.,"This place sucks. Also, it's in Long Island City. There are tastier ways to throw your money away.","Great experience - highly recommend! Tucked away in LIC is a gem of a steakhouse. Shoutout to the guy shucking oysters as he has some skills! There weren't any shell pieces crumbling and the oysters were delicious!We split the 20 oz Ribeye and it was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The sommelier walked around and suggested some great wines for us to try before selecting a perfect pairing. They were playing Young Frankenstein on the TV which added to the quirkiness of the spot.Ordered Key Lime Pie for dessert and it feeds 2-4 people depending on how full you are - it's a whole pie!!Overall a great meal and awesome wait staff. Everyone was so nice and accommodating, we'll definitely be back!!","Pretty terrible service. No filet mignon on the menu. 1 special that was an appetizer. Terrible options for sides I think only 1 negotiable side. Steak was really good and food was good but for $160 a man, gotta be a whole lot better. Won't be back","I had a wonderful meal at M. Wells!For appetizers we ordered the JOHN'S GUNDY(Potato Waffle, Pickled Smelts, Crème Fraîche, Roe, Dill) and the WHITE ASPARAGUS PROVENÇAL(Pickled Ramps, Crispy Maitake). John's Gundy was the perfect kick off to the meal. Well balanced and refreshing...I'm still thinking about it. The White Asparagus was good, but in hindsight I wish I got something else instead. Just didn't do much for me, but wasn't bad at all. For our mains we ordered the GRASS-FED RIBEYE(Coffee/Porcini Rub, Sauce Bordelaise) and CHICKEN-FRIED BEEF HEART (Red Eye Gravy). The ribeye came out perfectly rare, as ordered. It had a beautiful char on the outside due to the rub and being cooked over an open wood fire grill. Chicken heart was a first for me and I thought it was great - glad I ordered it as I think they'll be removing it from the menu soon. Our sides were poutine and pommes aligot. I've read from other reviews that the poutine is too salty. I agree, but I still enjoyed it. The pommes aligot were BOMB. Definitely order them if you come. Highly recommend coming to M. Wells!",M.

513,"I was at Pepboys nearby getting an oil change and was starving. I do my usual google and yelp search. Was in the mood for pizza. Saw this spot and drove there. Pizza was slamming. Got a salad on the side. It was a small salad should be considered large. From now on, when I get an oil change, I'm stopping here!","Favorite pizza in whole NYC since 2015( used to live in the neighborhood). Should I mention that 99.9% of the time I'm not eating meat, but once I come here( now it's happening very rare, maybe once a year)- chicken bacon honey mustard is everything.","Yea no thanks, was waiting on line and they clearly saw me walk in. I'm waiting to order and some other girl walks in that obviously knows the older Spanish counter man and just walks up and orders. He saw me waiting and took someone else because he knew her. Horrible customer service I'll stick with the rosas on metropolitan, not these unprofessional workers.","Always pleased with Rosa's. No matter what I order, their specialty slices never disappoint. The pizza is definitely fresh. The service is good, they are nice and friendly. They also make good hero sandwiches. I always stop in when I'm in the area and need a bite.","Whether you're getting a simple cheese slice, Sicilian slice, calzone, or pasta, you can't go wrong here. Everything is fresh and delicious, and there is a huge selection of pizza toppings you can order.  One of the best pizzerias in Queens.","Yesss. Simple pizza. Fancy pizza. Pizza with toppings. Fresh pizza. Whatever pizza you think you are craving, they have it. They a simple display with their offerings for the day. Staff is quick and efficient, and the restaurant itself is large with plenty of seating and bright lights. They're open until 1a (huge plus!), but nothing sketchy about this family friendly restaurant. I ordered a cheese slice, a white slice, a chicken/bacon/honey mustard slice and chicken/tomato slice (I shared, sadly).  The plain cheese slice was perfectly cooked. Cheese was gooey and plentiful, and the sauce was exactly what you think of when you think of pizza. The crust..this thing was insanely delicious, too! Imagine my excitement to try the rest of my slices! The favorite was definitely the chicken/bacon/honey mustard one. But they all were very delicious. FYI there's a 10$ min for card!Def recommend!",Rosa's Pizza
514,Very unprofessional and disappointing :(I tried to order a small bbq spare ribs like it said on the menu and the cashier told me that even though it says on the menu that there is small and large there is actual only one size.Anyway I sat down and ordered it .... there was very little meat and the pieces of meat that were there were under seasoned and under cooked.  A lot of the meat I was able to get was not chewable and I had to spit it out which is embarrassing.Besides that the service was terrible.  The whole staff was sitting down in the dining room and eating too.  The cashier/manager was actually sitting 2 tables over from me while my server and the other server were sitting in the back across from the cooks instead of doing their jobs.  The server didn't even ask me one time if the food was ok.  I also had to push my plate and glass to the edge of the table so the cashier/manager would call the server over with my bill. Terrible experience and I'll never be back.,"Ordered from the bund 2 years ago and it was terrible Chinese American food, now in 2019 I gave it another try yet it disappoints again. We ordered another time just out of convenience and It is still now good. The vegetables were soggy and oily and the meat was not fresh. We try the whole sweet and sour fish as well as the fish fillet in hot sauce and it was not tasty or fresh as the restaurants in Manhattan or spice C in forest hills. Overall, not the place to go for Chinese food in forest hills- go to spice C cuisine or even the other schehuan restaurant on that street.",Ok food nothing special but it's good to have a options in my neighborhood. I like spinach garlic sauté! But stay away from drunken chicken. It taste terrible and very stinky! It literally taste like they poured hard liquor on the chicken. My CHINESE FAMILY said that they made it terribly. We threw away after one bite.,"Easily my go-to for food in town. My girlriend and I love eating here, whether it's taking the short walk over or even just ordering delivery home, the quality is always top notch. Great soup dumplings, AND THAT SOUP! I almost forgot about the bund superior soup that we always order. It's an amazing portion size for the price and it's fixes us up when we are feeling under the weather. Came in today for the Szechuan boiled fish and Szechuan chicken and we're blown away for a second time. If you're thinking of coming in for dinner, don't hesitate. The staff is nice and the food comes out quick. We're consistently pleasantly surprised whenever the food comes out because we don't expect it so soon. Enjoy!","Average Shanghainese food, but they curiously market themselves in the broader category of Chinese cuisine on their windows. I'm guessing it's to attract a wider audience and to get those in here that are not familiar with just Shanghainese food, but either way, there's plenty of improvements that can be made.Recently, I came here for an early dinner on a Saturday evening at 6pm and the restaurant surprisingly already had plenty of customers inside. The menu was pretty big for a Shanghainese restaurant, or at least compared to other Shanghainese restaurants that we've been to. There were the usual cold appetizers, regular appetizers, soup dumplings and meat dishes (pork, beef, chicken and seafood). In addition, there were also vegetables, casserole specials, fried rice, noodles, rice cakes and much more. Like I said, the menu was something I could have sat there reading for an hour. However, we sort of just ordered our usual Shanghainese favorites.To keep it simple we ordered a few appetizers, a carb and a bigger casserole type dish. We started off with the spungy gluten (aka Kao Fu) and drunken chicken. The spungy gluten, as disgusting as that always sounds, wasn't bad. Compared to other Shanghainese restaurants it was decent. Good flavor, good texture and good serving size. As for the drunken chicken, freaking delicious. It was one of the best drunken chicken dishes I had in a while. At first, we thought the wine on the chicken was going to be very strong because the aroma really kicked in quick when the dish was set on our table. However, the strength of the wine on the chicken was jusssst right. Although it smelled strong, in actuality, it wasn't when eating the chicken and the chicken was perfectly flavored. For our non-appetizers, we ordered the Bund crab meat pork soup dumplings, pan fried pork buns, Shanghainese sautéed seafood udon noodles and flounder fillet with tofu casserole to share. The soup dumplings were on the sweet side, so we weren't huge fans of it. Texture-wise, I liked the thickness of the skin, the soup was hot and I thought the pork meatball was put together well, but there was a sweetness to the soup that we weren't used to. It definitely needed to be saltier. The pan fried pork buns weren't the greatest in that it was very dry inside where the meatball resided. I would have preferred more sauce inside that could have made the bun more moist.The udon noodles were average and nothing that we were overly impressed about. To be honest, there's not much that can be done for this dish, but when it says seafood, I would expect seafood, which it was overly lacking.Finally, the flounder fillet with tuna lacked flavor. It was sizzling in a clay pot when it came out, which was music to our ears, but there wasn't a whole lot to it. The sauce was bland, which made everything in there taste the same.The service was good throughout and the waiters/waitresses were friendly, so I hate to say the following. The Bund makes for an average local spot, but compared to the restaurants in Flushing, it has a lot of work to do to catch up. The food is by no means terrible, but some of the food can use better flavors and a bit more salt, which is something I typically don't say, but it's definitely something that needs to be mentioned here. For now, they're on the low end of 3 stars.","We were drawn to The Bund Chinese Cuisine by a recent New York Times article about the surge of quality Chinese restaurants in Forest Hills, NY. Food: OK (3 of 5). The Bund was a decent experience. We had:- Bund Pork Soup Dumplings (福園小籠包)- Crab Meat Pork Soup Dumplings (蟹粉小籠包)- Pan Fried Pork Buns (福園生煎包)- Chicken with Eggplant (茄子雞)We thought the soup dumplings were good, but not great. The soup dumplings here use a regular (thicker) dumpling skin that render the dumplings less susceptible to breakage. The filling in the pork soup dumplings and pan fried pork buns are similar -- flavorful and juicy, but it seemed to have an extra sharpness or tingle that wore out its welcome after a few helpings. This could be MSG, but I'm not sure. The crab meat pork soup dumplings were similar to the pork soup dumplings, but with the addition of some crab meat. The crab meat flavor was less noticeable here than at other establishments.The Chicken with Eggplant was well-executed and very flavorful. It comes with a bowl of white or brown rice; you may need more because the dish is heavily-sauced.Service: Good (3 of 5).Value: OK (3 of 5). The restaurant makes its pork soup dumplings complimentary if your order is $35 or more and paid in cash, for orders after 3 PM and all day Saturdays and Sundays. The minimum purchase required for free pork soup dumplings is $25 paid in cash weekdays from 11:30 AM to 3 PM. Suggested tips are based on pre-tax subtotals.Atmosphere: Good (3 of 5). Comfortable seating. Two unisex bathrooms.",The Bund
515,Such a nice place but some employees need extraordinary customer service training. They provide the location and the customer does all the work. Customers -order their food at counter-must pick up their own drinks -if you sit outside you must bring your own cups and plates back inside Employee-brings out food. That's all they do It's a younger generation working there and to bad on the day I was there it seems like they don't care. Hopefully management will at least change the policy that employees carry the drinks as well to the table.,"Went there for a nice cup of Joe with my wife at 8 PM in the evening. Sat down and waited for 10 minutes,  nobody bothered to come to our table. There was one person working behind the counter and three people working in the kitchen. Needless to say I will not be returning to this establishment.","I am pretty disappointed with the experience I had here. Since it was my first time coming here and I read a lot of the reviews I had high hopes but I don't understand the hype.First off, the employees who work here seemed like they really hated their job and weren't welcoming. We ordered the chicken melt w/ Tomato Bisque soup, egg salad and salmon sandwich and vanilla chai latte. The amount of soup they give you is very little. The bread on the sandwich was very dry and the salmon didn't taste fresh. The food was just okay, not great. Also this may sound unimportant to some, but I was really expecting a cuter design on my latte, not what I got. I also didn't realize how overpriced this place was.  Lastly a very IMPORTANT suggestion that I hope this cafe takes seriously: In the parking lot there is a sign that states ""Cafe 1 is not responsible for theft or damage to car"" okay, but another sign that also NEEDS to put right next to it is ""Please be mindful of the way you park"" because in all seriousness, by the time I was leaving this place, there were two new scratches on my car because people were parked so terribly and some cars were taking up two parking spots and I had no space to get into my car! Very disappointed with the experience I had here ugh.","Really great study cafe. I've been here about 3 times so far and each time has been a really productive study session which can be attributed to the great ambiance in this cafe. The interior feels cozy with the dim mood lighting and comfortable seating. Very spacious and clean - I was always able to find a seat to get my work done. The other great thing about this cafe is the food! They have a really great selection of things to eat if you get hungry, as well as a plethora of desserts - highly recommend the mini taiyaki! They have Nutella ones Also wanted to mention that the staff is extremely kind, helpful and welcoming! Highly recommend!","Cute little cafe! I went here for brunch with my husband, our friends, and their baby daughter. What I appreciated was that they not only had indoor seating, but also outdoor seating right out back, and the trees around led for a shady and pleasant meal. The food was definitely tasty, but a portion of what they offer is listed in chalkboards or signs inside, so you have to be sure and go in to check out their full selection. They have these adorable fish shaped pastries that are filled with either Nutella or a sweet bean paste that have me drooling thinking about them!!!I'm normally not an avocado toast person, but the flavor profiles they had have since converted me!They also had a nice coffee and tea selection, I'd recommend going here when you have some time to just relax and enjoy your meal. Not to say you couldn't take it to go, but it's worth not rushing!","The food here always look sooo good and after seeing so many pics of the eggs benedict, I had to obviously try them. Honestly, the presentation is better than the taste. The eggs benedict with smoked salmon on a waffle were not that good. The whole wheat waffles are healthier than regular waffles but I still expected it to be crispy outside and moist inside - instead, it had a grainy texture, dry inside, and soft outside. The smoked salmon was a little too salty which overpowered the hollandaise sauce on the eggs benedict :(Butttt the green tea latte was exactly what I was craving since I was pretty cold that morning so that was really nice. They ran out of peppermint so my mom ordered a regular latte w/ skim - thought it had too much coffee and not enough milk making it too strong for her liking.We def wanted to try the taiyaki as well but after waiting on line, the cashier told the customer in front of me that they didn't have any more (we went  Saturday 11:30 am) - anyways by the time we left, the place was paaacked so maybe their other foods r better",Café 1 of a Kind
516,"Nothing marked on the menu as vegetarian is vegetarian, even the tortilla chips contain lard and nothing is marked as such. Being that this is in a major hotel you expect there to be at least one thing not made with lard -- especially when it's marked as vegetarian. 1 extra star because they accommodated a large group very quickly on the spot",Horrible quality Mexican food. It's on the first floor of the Holiday Inn hotel. I think this place is mostly made for hotel guests visiting NYC who do not know the great quality of Mexican food available in the city. It's also overpriced. They charge for every little extra items such as if you ask for a chips refill or sour cream. None of your food comes with sour cream which is pretty bad. They also include 18% mandatory tip even if you are just a couple having a dinner there versus you are with a large party. Avoid this place and spend your money elsewhere. You can find much better Mexican places to around LIC or Asforia.,The worst Mexican food I have had in a very long time. We ordered Steak Fajita and the meat was chewy and it didn't taste like beef. The food was over priced and charged us for sour cream. Do you self a favor save your frustration and money and go else where!,"Came for dinner last night and had the enchiladas- meat, chicken and cheese which came with rice and beans. I'm a wimp when it comes to spice and they made them perfectly. My husband had a burger with swiss cheese and it was cooked the way he likes it and was a good size. Vanessa took care of us and made sure everything came out perfectly including our drinks.Today's lunch fish tacos... absolutely perfect!!","We came here on a Wednesday night.Place was empty, only two other people were eating.Service was  friendly.Waitress came over took our orders. Then came back with drinks and asked me if i wanted everything at once or if we wanted our chips and guac first.I said bring the chips first.They brought a small thing of chips with some black bean dip that are complementary and like 15 minutes later (which I thought it was a long time) they brought our chips and guac.Chips were good, guac was brown which threw my sister in law off. Guacamole tasted good it just looked like it was sitting out for a while.Once we were done with the chips and guac 20-25Minutes went by and there was no sign of our food so i asked my husband to check. Turns out homegirl never put in the order. WHAT THE HECK? We waited another 15-20 minutes and finally our food comes...We got chicken quesadillas and their sample platter to share (which is huge) i also got elotes on the side.Everything was cold, and when i say everything its EVERYTHING. Who serves cold quesadillas, taquitos,Wings, elotes etc, everything was cold! Didnt have a good experience so not coming back.","Cute place. Apart of the holiday inn. Looks a little sketchy from the outside but very nice on the inside. The staff was very friendly. Our waitress was a doll. We started with chips and guac. The guac was delicious- and I know good guac. The chips were a little stale. We paid 10.75 for the guac...which in my opinion is a little pricey, especially when you get stale-ish chips and not a whole lot of guac. Definitely not enough for more than 2 ppl. Between my husband and I we got the carne asada, pulled chicken (we each got one), carnitas and the al pastor (marinated pork with chunks of pineapple) tacos. My husband loved the al pastor. His favorite and came highly recommended as the best taco by our waitress. (I deferred I can't do pineapple with foods) We both tried the pulled chicken and that was delicious. Good flavor. For the carne Asada and carnitas- very good nut NEEDS the salsas they have for more flavor. Ask and they will bring you three different salsas. Each taco was 3.50. So for 5 tacos, chips and guac (no drinks) total came out to 42.00. A little pricey. Was it a good meal though? Yes! Could I see myself going back? YesIf you check in on yelp you get a free margarita! I'm pregnant so I will have to wait.",Juquila Kitchen and Bar
517,Someone said there is a lot of haters for this diner. Count me as one of the haters. I was at a family event and the organizer of the event pick this diner as the spot for brunch. They called ahead for a group of 20 and the diner manager was not ready for our group. We had to wait 30 minutes. Half of our group were seated but the other half had to wait another 10 minutes. The diner is small. The service was slow. There was a guy refilling coffee cups. We placed our orders and we waited 35 to 40 minutes for our food to arrive. The food was below average. My classic burger came with a lot of fries and two onion rings lol. My burger was dry and tasteless. My gal pal ordered the patty melt and the meat was dry tasteless. Someone wrote the diner served big portions but bigger portions doesn't mean good food. I would not come back to this diner willingly.,Food is consistent and always great in a pinch. The low rating is mainly due to how OVER priced it is. At the end of the day it's a diner not Russian Tea Room.,"Would like to thank the Tower Diner in Forest Hills for the nice RAW chicken cutlet sandwich, and OLD ROMAINE!!!  And, yes... we called. Told us to come down... da fuck! No, you delivered it, you come get this one and bring us something that isn't disease on bread... we keep saying we aren't ordering again... now, finally, lesson learned... And what we got re-delivered? Half of a chicken cutlet that has been fried to within an inch of its life,  soggy and cut in half...","Tower Diner gets way too many haters.This place is responsible for feeding about half a million people a day because it's the only place that's any good within a 1/2 mile radius. It's the only place that's open as late as they are and their delivery system beats everyone else. If you're looking for diner food: Bacon & Eggs, Waffles, French Toast, Grilled Cheese, Burgers w/ Waffle Fries, Mozzarella Sticks, chicken wings, chicken fingers, chicken sandwich, turkey clubs and pastrami/Ruben sandwiches THEN THIS IS YOUR SPOT. Don't walk into a diner expecting the most delicious filet mignon you've ever had and blame it on the diner at 1 AM. Tower Diner gets five stars from me and anyone who lives remotely close to it agrees.","Had dinner at the Tower Diner on Wednesday night. A standard diner with a ton of offerings and consistent, if not exciting food.Quality: The hardest part of dining at Tower Diner is making your way through the seemingly endless menu of items. They have almost anything you can imagine. I decided to get a greasy appetizer in Mozzarella Sticks and then breakfast for dinner. The Mozzarella Sticks were a solid choice with an interesting thicker outside that reminded me a bit of tequenos. My meal was the Texas Hash, which was just okay. I did not love the hash with a heavy dose of chicken instead of the traditional potato and veggies.Quantity: Like most diners, they serve huge portions.Value: $10 for Mozzarella Sticks. $14 for the Texas Hash.Ambiance: Tower Diner is located in Forest Hills, Queens. Very much your classic neighborhood diner, it doesn't try to do too much. The seating area is large and they have a small bar as well. The ceilings inside are surprisingly high with an indent in the center where the clock tower sticks up. They also have a television that shows sporting events and news.Crowd: A lot of regulars who knew the staff well.Service: Fast and friendly service. It seemed like everyone working had been there for years.Parking: A fair amount of street parking in the area.",It's an authentic place for brunch and their portion of food is quite big so my father in law really loves Tower Diner. Their quality of food wasn't outstanding good but it's a suitable place for family gathering since there is a great variety on menu and everyone can be satisfied to find what they want on the menu.,Tower Diner
518,"Indonesian food was soso for the area, went with my wife who is from Indonesia and I have made multiple trips to Indonesia. Food had a lack of spices usually experienced. Service was lacking, we were the only customers in the restaurant and I had to walk around to find someone to refill my water. After paying the bill one of the staff had to rush after us demanding a tip.The experience as a whole was very offputting, I will keep my business with Sky Cafe,  and the Warung at the grocery across the street.","The sushi here tastes really really bad. It's shocking how old the ingredients are, brown avocado and mushy tuna. Staff was nice enough.Update: Please use fresher ingredients and neater plating. It really makes a difference",I ordered spicy tuna. Umm this is not it... every other sushi Ordered did not come as described. also the fish is not fresh and I'm having terrible indigestion. If you're looking to order good sushi stay away!!!!!,"Indonesian food is very unique that you can't judge by its look. First time I was here, the server didn't know the food well and we only order what he recommended and they were not good. Today, I came here with my kids for second time. I decided to stick with the ones I know. (I have many Indonesian friends) We ordered two different bowls of soup noodles from their special menu on the board. And take away a chicken & beef rendang rice with fried eggs (also on the special menu board). All these food literally blow our minds away. They are all very flavorful and very fulfilling.  My kids literally lick the plates after they finished their food. And this is their first time eating Indonesian soup noodle. And they are very picky eaters. So that says something.","Awang serves Indonesian food as well as sushi, but I decided to stick with the Indonesian dishes. Prices are a little higher than some of the other Indonesian restaurants in the area, but the food is delicious. All entrees come with rice. I had the soto betwani, which is the best version of the dish I had so far. The soup was very flavorful and there was plenty of beef and tripe. I enjoyed the pickled cucumber pieces that came on the side. It's a very refreshing palette cleanser. My friend had the grilled pompano with honey, which was also very good but be careful of bones. The fish is sliced in half and grilled. The thai iced tea was sweet and flavorful, not watered down.","Most authentic Indo food in the 5 boroughs with a nice sit down dining room, larger selection than most places and flavors that actual Indonesians actually like. Don't sleep on the specials board; get them to translate for you what each thing is. You probably won't find any of it in any other place. Awang will come out and take care of you if you ask for him.They seem to make sushi to pay the bills -- a sad fact of life that the great Indonesian food doesn't seem to attract the take out orders. I would skip it, but that being said, I saw Indonesian people order the sushi so at least it's a trusted thing (whether or not it's authentic or good is a different story.)Grilled pompano was awesome, so was the fried tofu and gado gado. Fried chicken was a tad dry, but willing to give this one the benefit of the doubt and try it again next time.",Awang Kitchen
519,"Not worth the wait and price for the food quality. First of all the wait was the most infuriating part! When my family and I arrived the hostess rudely told us we'd have to wait 30 minutes if we wanted a table inside (it was about to rain so we didn't want to sit outside). We waited about 30 minutes. Finally, when we got the table and ordered. But not to my surprise it took FOREVER to get our food. I saw tables that came after us get their food already. By the time my food came, I just wanted to eat and leave. Second the price for the food quality is totally not worth it. I have literally had thai food half the price of this place that is way better. The chicken in my spicy basil fried rice was very chewy and rubbery and I was missing tomatoes. My parents' steak was so unseasoned and dry, I felt bad for even taking them to this place! Not to mention the sticky rice that came along with it, I understand that presentation matters but regular rice would have been better. Lastly, the part that topped it all off was the way the servers had an attitude towards our table and when we left they were laughing in a way that sounded like they were mocking us. Anyways I don't think I'll ever come here again.",I had lunch today at this restaurant. The drinks were really good! The food was very tasty and freshly made. We tried the Asian duck which was on point. Prices were also quite reasonable for the portions we received .I took one star away because of the our server who was not very friendly !! He also visited the table way too often to tidy up every 2 minutes which was very annoying. I realized it was just him since on observation all the other servers seemed pretty friendly and NORMAL. I will definitely try them again though !!!,"Just tried a couple more dishes.  They delivered in all: taste, presentation and quality.    Service is always attentive and friendly.Overall, I highly recommend this place for authentic Thai food.","This is hands down the best thai restaurant in astoria. It is a perfect date night spot, the restaurant is beautifully decorated and it was packed when we went and its not a hole in the wall like some other thai restaurants. We got the pad kee mao which normally comes in a burning heat but they adjusted the level of spiciness for us. The food was spectacular and the serving was huge! They also included veggies which i really appreciated, the noodles were fresh and the flavor was there! We also got curry puffs which were not fantastic but definitely good. The server and hostess were super sweet. This place is our to go spot from now on. I have already recommended this restaurant to all my coworkers who frequent astoria. This place is definitely a neighborhood gem. *Tip: they are super accommodating and understand that thai spice may be overwhelming for the american palate. If your not used to thai spice, you'll find your face burning. If you need let the server know, they'll adjust it to the level your used to.","This is hands down the best thai restaurant in astoria. It is a perfect date night spot, the restaurant is beautifully decorated and it was packed when we went. We got the pad kee mao and they adjusted the level of spiciness for us.

520,"Great streak grilled to perfection. Ordered New York strip steak, it was . It was 14 oz, but I can finish it all! The sauce is not a highlight actually, it didn't add much more flavor to the steak  as I think.","I came to this spot and really wanted to take out my cousin to eat some A5 Wagyu+Uni. Unfortunately, the day I went in they were out of Uni-how sad is that!!! I went for lunch in the daytime and they already ran out of Uni?! SO EARLY. We got the Wagyu sandwich and was good-but i'm not a good ""meat"" judge. Was really looking forward to their other sandwich","Though we've lived in the neighborhood for awhile, we hadn't made it to Salt and Charcoal yet. We decided to go when we met a couple at a restaurant in LA who said this place was their favorite restaurant in all of NYC. To be honest, this place is decent, but maybe not quite worth the price compared to some of the other Japanese style steakhouses in the city. The sushi was actually the star of the meal, with the steak tartare as a close second (though not sure the portion was worth the steep $34 price tag). Unfortunately, the NY strip was the disappointing part of the meal. We asked for it medium rare, but it came far closer to medium well.","Salt and Charcoal is a delicious Japanese steakhouse.  The place itself is small and has an open wall where some diners can see the chefs and cooks in action.  There is also some outdoor sidewalk seating.  Service was polite but not always efficient, and it took a very long time for our food to be served, because our waiter didn't put our main order in.  Fortunately after my wife inquired our food was out in 15-20 minutes.  The food itself was delicious.  The gem salad was unique and worthwhile, and our Wagyu steak was tender and flavorful.  Recommended!","Looked this place up because mt friends wanted to do a steak dinner for a gathering.Price is a little fancy, but the service is what you pay for so that balances out. Staff is super friendly.Originally I thought the wagyu was gonna be the star of the show, but even though it was nicel marbled it was lacking in taste and had some tendon toughness to it.I would definitely recommend their aged porterhouse. Their baked potato is solid as well.","I wanted to try this restaurant for long time and my friends and I was just hanging out in the area. We saw tons of good reviews about food in this place so we didn't feel disappointed at all after we had dinner. Highlight of this restaurant is beef. There are so many kind of beef preparations. We had....- Uni Fillet Mignon : excellence! 10/10- Grilled Bronzino : delicious 9/10- Assort Sashimi of the Day : very fresh 9/10- Kaisou Salad : only one that we weren't crazy about 6/10Service is great, server kept checking our table, kept cleaning but waiting a bit long to add up some more orders.",Salt + Charcoal
521,"I would rate Tea Cup Cafe four and a half stars. I ordered the fish tom yum. This soup is the Thai version of a Japanese ramen or a Vietnamese pho. The soup had a mild flavor. There were some hints of celery. I ordered it with medium spiciness and the spiciness level was just right. I'm not sure which pepper was used but I definitely felt it in my sinus since I used 6 napkins. There were a lot of ingredients in the soup including fish cakes, green onions, bean sprouts, and plenty more. The soups were very reasonably priced at under $10 for most of them.","This place is good to grab a few drinks like coffee and frappes. However, one of the workers here greeted us rudely, telling me to either buy something asap or leave. I always come in and settle down for a few minutes before ordering but ever since this experience, I don't feel welcome in this place. Not recommended if you're looking for a good customer service at place to eat.",Food is really good but customer service is terrible. The female cashier who was rolling her eyes because I asked her questions.,My favorite thing here is the banana and chocolate boba.  I think the best thing about the boba here is that they have various flavors and the balls are satisfyingly chewy. They sell food as well as other desserts which I haven't tried yet.,I love this place so much! Yummy food for a fair price and the toast they sell is to die for!! It is an absolute must try. The location is also super convenient!,"This place serves the best tom yum soup ever! The place looks like a regular cafe that I thought its just a typical place to hang out and drink some coffee or juice but actually its not. When I walk in I observed most people is eating some noodle soup so that means their food is a must try and we ordered the tom yum soup base on one person that I ask what shes eating. Yup, I ask because her food looks yummy. Their menu is pretty funny. You walk to the counter and its just a written menu opposite side of the counter then you order and seat then they'll just bring the food to the table. I can't forget the tom yum soup because it taste a little sweet, very spicy and sour. My kind of taste that I went to this place twice in a week. Really good! I also tried their pandan crepe with vanilla icecream on the side and its not very sweet. Not to much ingredients but it taste really good. Me and my friends enjoyed the food.",Tea Cup Cafe
522,"While the menu is disorganized, the milk tea itself is really good. I got the jasmine tea with half and half and pearls. The pearls are smaller than the ones you'd get from Gong Cha / KF Tea and they don't taste like they've been sitting in the water for days.","Consistency of the milk tea is light, not thick, which I prefer. The taro drink is made of taro puree - it wasn't heavy as I thought it would be. I asked for less sugar but was told that it was sweet enough without, so much better for me. The matcha kitkat latte was made with soy milk and reminded me of sweetened mung bean flavor. Even with the large-sized drinks, they didn't feel overwhelming and we were able to finish. Too bad they didn't have coffee jelly yet...soon they said.",It's a small store with few seating areas. They offered board games as well. I really want to like this place since the staffs are really friendly but the drinks are just mediocre. I've been here twice and both times were disappointed with my drinks.,"I love my earl grey tea.  It was more expensive than the average tea spot, but I understand the reason.  Each cup of tea is made fresh.  You can tell by the taste.  It's smooth and highly refreshing.  The lady who works here is super friendly and down-to-earth.  I enjoyed my visit and would definitely revisit.  It's a bit of a walk from broadway N/W train station but absolutely worth it.  There's also a reward program thingie.","I did not like their signature taro milk unfortunately. I was really excited to come here with family but the texture was so gritty, and it felt like I was drinking taro flavored grits. I am used to a smoother texture. Perhaps I could come back and try a different option, but I was genuinely so surprised when I took a sip. Maybe their teas are better but I really like my taro drinks to have more water rather than grit. The staff was really nice in explaining their drinks to my family and they were so quick with the orders. I did not like my drink though.","Before the bubble tea craze spreaded all over the borough, Tea and Milk was practically the only boba game in Astoria. And still today, they remain one of the only sucessful non-chain bubble tea businesses in NYC, all while having developed serious fanfare amongst the local community. The shop is as small as many other cafes / bubble tea places. There is one large communal table inside with limited seating as well as an outdoor bench. Most of the staff is of college age and is super nice. Perhaps one of these days, they'll take over an old bakery and revamp the space so it can become a destination spot with WiFi and the works.But of course, the real draw is the drinks. At various sizes they do a good job with the branding and offer a good variety of flavors that extend beyond the basic stuff that some boba shops might showcase. It's important to note they don't use powder when making their drinks. Sure, the prices aren't entirely budget friendly, however, their high quality product proves its value quickly.My boba jam is their hibiscus flower peach and their taro milk. Both are refreshing and mildly sweet and I prefer no boba in either of them. The roasted oolong is also worth a look, as is the signature grandma masala chai. There are new flavors constantly being added to the menu as well as seasonal ones that shouldn't be missed.They also deliver at this point, which is pretty awesome. I am hoping they stick around for a long time seeing as non-corporate boba is such a rare thing. To the team at T&M: keep doing what you're doing, we'll be drinking.",Tea and Milk
523,Very slow service. I've been here many times and I have never experienced such a lengthened period of time just for my food. It's already been more than half an hour for my food. Terrible service. Please change the cook or whatever needs to be done.,"The beef was unfortunately very dry and tough- As were the dumplings. The noodles were extremely oily and the hot sauce just over powered any other flavors. When we ordered the take out, it took quite a bit of time to get someone to take our order as well.","Don't be fooled by the name Tibet . No where near a Tibetan hospitality or service. The waitress lady is very rude.  There was no greeting and when I asked if I could sit , she nods as if you are not welcome. I asked her if she could clean the table . She pretends to  wipe the table but then leaves the dirty     towel on that same table where they just collected the dirty plates and bowls.  She then goes to the cash register and just stands there and looks. I waited for a bit to see if she would come with a menu and wipe the table but she didn't . I happily left that place and went to a good Tibetan restaurant called PHAYUL which was just about 2 blocks away.   There are  other real Tibetan restaurants in that area. Skip this one","Walking in, a picture of the Potala Palace in Lhasa next to a picture of the Dalai Lama, might be a good hint that you are in for some delicious Tibetan food. Wow. Just wow. I was really blown away by how good the food here was. For reference I had spicy beef tongue and beef dumplings. The dumplings were very flavorful on their own, but I opted to add some of the chili sauce that was on the tables. (The chili sauce was delicious as well, and was actually packing some heat).  I really don't know how to describe the dumplings but the flavor and something on how they were seasoned was great. Some of the best dumplings I've had to be sure. The beef tongue though, oh it was good. This was really where the dish was fantastic. I would say the best comparison I can thing of would be to Sichuan mala pig ear. It was absolutely amazing, and with just a great texture that I hadn't had before with beef tongue. The service here was great and very attentive, and they had a good list of beers available. A note - If spicy food isn't your for forte, be cautious for spicy dishes as well as the chili sauce on the table - it isn't overpowering, but it does have a nice kick to it.",Simple clean cuisine. The food is unique here and differently different from other South Asian cuisine. I found the food here light in flavor. We ordered chive momos which sounded unique but had no flavor snd were oily. The soup warmed our stomachs and was fresh but flavor was lacking. This place is popular for Tibetans so I'll be back and try it again.

Rude staff, tried to send me away because ""all empty tables are reserved"" except those tables Sat vacant for 30 minutes until someone who was dressed nicer walked in. Ended up with a table that was squeezed in, which was fine. Food was lackluster, portions were tiny, and when I asked if a protein could be added to my pasta dish, I was told ""we don't do that here"" in a very judgmental tone. Two stars because what little food I had was good, but I would never suggest anyone should go here if anything else is open.",I have never been appreciative of Pasta.. I always find it bland and the Strozzapreti Alla Norma and Cavatelli that we had last night was no exception to a rather bland pasta experience I had. Maybe it's the Indian in me who is always craving for more spices! I also never understood the price to quality ratio of pasta. I'd never pay $23 for that Cavatelli. Nothing great about it.Service was good and the ambience of this place is really nice. I wish they get their liquor license soon!,"I picked up a 10"" Levante pizza lunch. My god was it unbelievable. This is high end, gourmet quality decadence. So unbelievably fresh, so much flavor, wow. Although I picked up, I can tell it's an awesome spot for a power lunch with your colleagues. Furthermore, the bartender was nice enough to ask me if I would like water while I waited. Although I've only eaten here once, I'm assuming any less than stellar reviews are posted due to it being an expensive place with less than Cheesecake Factory-like portions. This is understandable; however, you get top tier quality here. Five stars.",We got a seat outside and ordered the pappardelle with duck and levante pizza with a side of roasted potatoes. Both the pasta and the pizza was divine! The serving portions were huge also and so we had to take a few slices home. One star off because our waiter forgot about our potatoes and we had to ask for it to-go at the end of our meal...AND he forgot our bag and we saw it sitting by the counter.... must have been his off night. Go try the pizza though!,Food  definitely lives up to the quality expectations. NYC is generally quite expensive for decent seating restaurants so by that standards I wouldn't call this expensive. We ordered cheese balls that were wonderfully crisped and came with onion garlic sauce. My meatball appetizer was too die for!!

525,Hands down best soup in NYC -- no ifs ands or but's about itAdd the tiniest suspicion of vinegar and hot oil and enjoy...,"The quality has gone down :( This used to be my must-stop in flushing. This time, I ordered lamb noodle soup as usual, but did not find the usual ingredients in there. It was missing all the vegetable stuff that should come with the noodle. Price also went up. They finally put up a proper menu on the wall, but it felt different. They no longer offer S/L sizes, just one price for all.","Got their lamb noodle soup. It was just decent, wished they gave more lamb or bigger pieces of it. The broth was nice but a bit bland. Had to add vinegar and their hot chili oil, but their hot chili oil tasted really stale and made the noodle soup taste bad. I should of tasted the chili oil before adding it to the noodle.","My dream came true since I watched Youtube video by Mikey Chen. I was dreaming about Lamb Noodle Soup for a long time, and I finally made it! Yeah, this must be the best Lamb Noodle Soup in the U.S. I can't get this in where I live, Anaheim, California, or any Lamb Noodle Soup for that matter. It is hard to get Lamb Noodle Soup, and authentic one like this? No way. I loved loved loved this soup and you need to try this once in a life time.","This is the ultimate bowl of noodle soup in Flushing.  I was going back and forth between this place and Lan Zhou Handmade Noodles, but Lamb Noodle Soup wins.Came here for the usual lamb noodle soup with hand-pulled noodles (biang biang style).  It costs $7.50 and is truly a bargain.  Just looking at the broth, you know you're in for a treat.  Before you add chili oil or black vinegar to it, taste the broth by itself first and marvel at how rich and complex it is.  The broth has such a gelatinous mouth feel and such a deep lamb flavor that it is impossible not to be amazed by it.  I like to add a little bit of chili oil and that's it.  Remember that scene from Seinfeld where Elaine had to sit down after having a taste of the soup nazi's soup?  Well, this is that good.The noodles are fantastic as well.  Since they're pulled by hand, they're long and each bite is unique in thickness and width.  The lamb itself is very tender and is gamey in the best possible way.  There are some rice noodles and thin slices of tofu skin in the soup as well.Altogether, this bowl is the epitome of what Flushing has to offer.  This is where I bring my guests from outside NY to show them what Flushing is all about.  This location is the original location and they have a branch in the New World Mall food court (stall #28), but this original location does it better.  I like the environment better (seems much less commercialized) and I feel the soup here tastes better.  I also think they do a better job with the noodles at this original location.I also tried some of the chicken feet, which come cold and cost $0.50 each.  If you're a fan of gelatinous tendon and skin, you'll love it.  I wasn't wowed by the flavor at first, but the more I ate them, the more I enjoyed it.They recently increased the price to $7 for the normal bowl and $7.50 for the big bowl.  It's still so worth it.  Get the big bowl!","Golden Mall food court wins over New World Mall food court not with variety, but because it Golden Mall has the original locations of both Lamb Noodle Soup as well as Lan Zhou Handmade Noodles.  This Lamb Noodle Soup location is upstairs in the very back.  Just look for the bright red sign that says ""lamb noodle soup"".When you come here, you must get lamb noodle soup!  I've had a lot of bowls of noodle soup in my life, but the broth you receive is unlike anything I have ever tasted before.  The broth is so rich and complex, with a distinct lamby flavor that has just a hint of gaminess.  Included are pieces of braised lamb (or lamb offal), some veggies, some wood-ear mushrooms, and some freshly pulled noodles cooked to order.  Make sure you add some hot oil, but not so much as to obscure the flavor of that broth.On a rainy day in Flushing, this place wins for me every time.  I love sitting on a rickety stool in this little shop slurping hand-pulled noodles and sipping that warm broth.  There's something very comforting and homey about the place.This is my second favorite bowl of noodles in Flushing (first being the pork intestine noodle soup at Lan Zhou), but it is definitely the only lamb noodle soup I can eat now because no other lamb noodle soup will ever come close to this.",Lamb Noodle Soup 滋補羊肉燴面
526,Everything is great.Authentic Japanese sushi.In season fish delivered from Japan.Very knowledgeable chef.Really good fried food.Great sushi.Uni Don is to die for...or I am just really craving uni?,"The food is amaaaaaaazing. I've been here twice and the sashimi is fresh and the cooked food is well prepared. They even use real wasabi! It's a bit pricey for dinner, but they have great deals on their lunch menu. On a side note, when we went for lunch today with our 8 month old, my husband and I felt that we were being ushered out of the restaurant right after we finished eating. Our baby was quiet during the meal and we cleaned up any food she dropped. However, she became very upset and started screaming right before we were about to leave. The owner, I presume, came over and told us ""the baby needs to be quiet because other people are eating."" I absolutely understand that that behavior is not welcomed in any restaurant and we were trying to calm her down. I hate being that mom who leaves a review because the baby was treated unfairly. However, there were only 3 tables besides our own, so I wish they would've been a little more understanding. I was debating on deducting a star given our experience today, but the food really does deserve five stars. I wouldn't recommend bringing young children though!",I definitely can taste the freshness of the fish here. The yellowtail i found to be exceptional. However i feel that the cooked food was a bit on the bland side.,"Owner chef Kawada-san is a genuine person, who is always thinking about the quality of his sushi and sashimi. When you are looking out for an authentic Japanese sushi based on the craftsmanship, Takesushi is one of the best in Queens.","Came here because we were hungry though wanted something light since it was too hot to eat something too heavy.Heard great things but never got a chance to try this place.  We walked in and it was a bit full though still there were some tables available.  We sat down and was offered tea or water.  My friend had water and I had tea -- which is real green tea -- so good.  The reason I mentioned my friend had water is because at the end of the meal, the waiter asked if she would like a cup of tea.We split the meal since I didn't want too much food:Appetizer - Age Dashi Tofu (3 huge pieces) and pork gyoza (5) - both were on point.  The tofu was lightly fried on the outside.  The gyoza was 2 bites of goodness.Entree - got 2 rolls one was tuna and the other was a fish from Japan (I forgot the name).  The fish was fresh.  It was smooth and melt in your mouth like butter.So happy we came to try this place and now I have to try the other great sashami or sushi.  There was a 45th Anniversary menu with fish from Japan on select dates.  Go check it out.Restrooms are located downstairs down a flight of stairs.  The women have 2 stalls and very clean.","Been coming here for years. Their fish quality is always amazing, great for authentic Japanese sushi. Fish is 70-80% from Japan, you can really taste the quality.  The chef flies to Japan to bring back fish weekly, I always love to try what he brings back. For dinner, I usually opt for the Lobster sashimi combo- whole lobster sashimi, nigiri and sushi set and miso soup for two. All their combos are amazing deals. Their grilled fish appetizers are really good too!Today, I lucked out and he had Uni Maguro bowl. He even gave me chu toro with uni from Maine and Hokkaido (my fave uni!). You will get excellent authentic sushi at reasonable (Queens) prices! Go here, it won't disappoint!",Takesushi
527,"First time at this specific Dallas BBQ a few weeks back. And as I same in more Dallas BBQ reviews, if you've been to one you've been to all. Decent service, food ain't all that great (despite I didn't order any food at this specific location) and of course the Texas size drinks. Had me a Texas size Beach Bomb that did hit the spot. This specific Dallas BBQ is very spacious as it can hold from what I saw more customers than possibly any other Dallas BBQ's than I've been to, but with that being said it doesn't have a bar area where you can sit and enjoy your drinks or a meal, so you have no choice but to as for a table. No biggie but bar areas are always nice. Will come here again whenever I am shopping in the Queens Center area.",Requested to sit in the front of restaurant which had plenty of space and was told that we couldn't.  He then turned his back to us.  Unprofessional etiquette.The greeter  mentioned that it was closed until 7pm but there were people that were just served their drinks.  We are regular Friday customers.  Bad customer service. We then decided to eat at Longhorn Steakhouse.,Requested to sit in the front of restaurant which had plenty of space and was told that we couldn't.  He then turned his back to us.  Unprofessional etiquette.The greeter  mentioned that it was closed until 7pm but there were people that were just served their drinks.  We are regular Friday customers.  Bad customer service. We then decided to eat at Longhorn Steakhouse.,I usually come to this bbqs. This is regular spot for me and my wife. The have some good food over there. I tell you we order from the 2 for $20 menu I would order the double white meat chicken breast with the honey glazed sauce on it.Along with the yellow rice and buttery corn bread what a good taste. It also comes with a small chicken soup that is seasoned just right. All for a good reasonable price.my wife ordered the rotisserie chicken breast and yellow rice and cornbread. And the drinks are pretty good and the prices weren't bad at all .the staff was great and they were very helpful .we enjoyed the atmosphere the whole time we were there .we will definitely Go back in  the future,"Firstly fantastic, 2 meals for $14.99 (rotisserie chicken deal)! Feeling peckish after the gym, stopped by here for their rotisserie chicken lunch special.The meal came with a small bowl of chicken and vegetable soup which was the highlight of the meal, probably the best one I've had ever. Everything else was subpar, chicken was bland and dry, cornbread was super dry (although it was my first time ever having it, I did like the sweetness to it), the rice was bland. But in saying all this, the portions were ginormous and one meal easily made for 2 sittings, value for money on that front.Staff were friendly and attentive, the restaurant was extremely spacious and clean, so points here too.Would I come back? Maybe for the ribs or wings but otherwise I don't recommend it.","Service was poor, our waitress took our orders and brought our orders and that was the extent of her service.  She never introduced herself nor asked how things were going nor refilled on our water.  She was in charge of the few tables surrounding us and I see her following up with other folks and refilling their water even though it was at the same water level as mine.  Did she think I was in college and by default I would give he a low tip? I have no clue, but the service here was not good.The food? I thought my dish was pretty good, I got the chicken with waffles which had this honey base glaze to it, the waffles had scallion and a hint of cheese in it.  Again, I liked it, but that was the only thing I enjoyed about this meal.  My wife ordered the early bird special which composes of half a chicken, rice, and a soup. It didnt come with a veggie which was suprising, I thought it would.  My wife got food poisoning from eating this, she had to make frequent visits to the bathroom and was throwing up for 2 days. We always eat the same things at home when we cook, however, however this was the only time we ate anything different.  Could have been the chicken being uncooked or stored at an unsafe temperature or the scallions being dirty that was sprinkled on top of her meal.  It was just horrible.From horrible service to horrible food, I'm sure I wont be coming back here at all.  The name that appeared on my receipt was Adrianna, which spoke to other surrounding tables (she spoke Spanish to my neighboring table) and water refilled. She skipped my table numerous times.  That's okay, I'll be skipping this business establishment during the many times I'll be in this area.",Dallas BBQ
528,"This is my go-to chicken tikka masala for the area (mainly because it's on seamless). The ice cream (at least for delivery) comes in a TINY little plastic container, so small that when we'd ordered it, we thought the delivery person had forgotten it at first. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯","This place never fails to satisfy the craving of North Indian food.Just went here the other night and nothing changed - amazing Indian food (one of my faves ever), great service, and BYOB!This place has me hooked and I will continue to frequent it as one of my places I dine out at.","Food is so delicious here. We got the butter chicken/chicken tikkka and a lamb dish.  I don't recall the name but it was with lamb and gravy. There was an appetizer with potatoes, mushrooms ,and paneer which wasn't as good. I wish the rice portions were a bigger.","The chicken chops are as good as you have heard about. No exaggeration, so if you are going with any number of people, at least 1-2 people need to order it and share! Not to put aside anything else they prepare. All other dishes are prepared with good flavor and spice balance, nothing harsh or bland. Rice is given with each order, not one bowl per 2 plates, which has become more and more common. Mango lassi is rich and yummy.","Delicious!! Ordered delivery and was so happy with our meal! Chicken chops- tender and flavorful, my husband loved!Saag paneer- rich in flavor but not creamy (yay!), cheese cubes were a nice texture of firm but not rubbery, also no ginger which I was happy about (I hate ginger)Chicken tikka masala- great flavor, generous chunks of tender chickenNaan- ok but nothing to write home about; lots of people raved about the garlic naan so I gave it a try but didn't really enjoy it. plain naan was fine, more pillowy than chewy like I usually expect naan to bePortions large and prices reasonable- this will be our new go to Indian delivery place!","After attending a Yelp event here I had to come back. The restaurant is on the small side but there are usually available tables. In the evenings, the atmosphere is intimate with the dim lighting. I had the chicken chop, chicken biryani with raita, and kheer (free with Yelp check in). The chicken biryani came in a cute little pot with a wooden lid. The first couple of bites isn't spicy. You'll think this isn't too bad but it builds up over time. The raita definitely helps neutralize the spiciness. The chicken chop is spicier. I am glad we got the raita. Both dishes were delicious and came with plenty of chicken. The kheer was also very good, creamy but not heavy nor overly sweet. I could taste the condensed milk. It's the best kheer I had so far.",Tikka Indian Grill
529,"The calzones take 20mins, but are life altering and 100% worth the wait.",The pizza was very good!! We chose the vegetarian pizza and liked it alot. The rest of the food was good (if you're hungry) but I really wouldn't recommend anything other than the pizza.,"every time I go to this place there always some type of issue. Either the pizza is burnt to the point of not being able to eat it.. a couple times ive made them re cook it but its gotten to the point that ive thrown it out and needed to go to the store to purchase something else on my limited time lunch break. there's always some issue with their bathroom, but I really think they just don't want anyone using it but then to specific customers I've noticed they have no issue with.. I don't know if this place has some type of prejudice against certain customers.. but something is definitely not right about this place and the service they provide.","Easily the best pizza anywhere around this area. Astoria, surprising as it may be, is a pizza wasteland. This place is an absolute gem. It is everything a classic NYC slice is supposed to be. Now that that's been said I do wish they would change up their cheese blend a little bit for cheesier bite. But even still, I plan to order from here again and again.",My favourite pizza place in the Area. A bit better than lucky king's pizza. My only issue with this place is the price as compared to places in Manhattan - $15 dollars with tax as compared to 2 bro's which is around $8 (both for the pie). Overall best choice by Queens Plaza,Food: 1/5Recently tried pasta for delivery because their pizzas were so memorable -ordered penne alla vodka and chicken francese. Both dishes were subpar. The alla vodka tasted like heavy cream and lacked the tomato taste. The chicken francese was bland and lacked flavor. It tasted like butter and had no hint of lemon. Both dishes were a disappointment. Their pizzas are GREAT but their pastas/sandwiches are subpar.Delivery: 4/5Their delivery is great! These guys are FAST!,Mike's Pizza
530,"The burger deserves 4 stars. It feels like a half pound, holds together, and is cooked to your requested temperature. If I was in the neighborhood I'm come back for the burger and a drink for sure.The negatives - the French fries where were thick cut and mostly soggy. The onion rings were 80% batter, doughy, and soft. The blue cheese on the burger didn't have much of the blue funk even though it looked like it should.","The food was not that great. My steak was over cooked, the hamburger was raw... the waitress was rushing us towards the end. There was a nice gentleman that greeted us when we left. But definitely would not return there. The wings were just okay. Nothing special. Cocktail shrimp was mediocre.","I came here because of the great reviews people commented about this place but boy do I regret it! This place is not for brunch!I came here with a party of 7 and 6 of us ordered bottomless mimosas and brunch. We were told that the all you can eat brunch buffet and bottomless drinks would be 20$ total, but we were charged 20$ for their disgusting brunch buffet and 8$ extra for the bottomless drinks for a total of 28$. Also, you cannot order bottomless drinks unless you pay for brunch.We were not allowed to change our bottomless drink selection so if you ordered mimosas you cant change it to blood marys at any point. We were only able to order bottomless drinks for 90 minutes but the waitress was never at our table! We spent most of the time waiting for her to bring us drinks than we did drinking! On top of that the drinks were watered down with barely any alcohol. So not worth the price. The brunch buffet was mediocre at best. the food was stale and looked sickly. I dont know how anyone can mess up bacon but this place did. There wasn't much food variety either for the price. The potatoes and meat tasted rancid. The only good thing about the brunch buffet is the guy making made-to-order omelettes. While he was working very hard to fulfill our orders, we were waiting up to 20 min at the omelette station just to get freaking omelettes because there was only one guy working there. The place is old, greasy, dark and has a bunch of fireplaces that are poorly placed. It looks dirty and haunted. The best looking thing about that place is probably the bathroom. The waitress was rude and sour. The place was obviously understaffed bc she never got around to our table. She sighed or said something under her breath every time we asked for our drinks and made the effort to attend to every table except ours. Her attitude was definitely not welcoming. And for the icing on the cake they included a 60% gratuity tip on our bill! After giving us disgusting food and mediocre service. The only person that deserved any tip was the guy making omelettes. I have no idea how this place got it's great reviews because it failed in every category for us. Worst brunch ever.","Donovan's is a great Irish pub in Woodside, Queens. My family has been going here for as long as I can remember (& FUN FACT - I actually celebrated my 1st Holy Communion here!) It is very traditional and the interior is super cozy with hardwood flooring, fireplaces throughout, mahogany bar, etc.It is a spacious restaurant that has a full bar area, and multiple rooms for diners and a good place to hold private events like birthdays and showers! They are famous for their hamburger and the perfect Guinness pour, which is why I think my dad started going here in the first place, many years ago. I love their wings, which I think they run a special for on Wednesday's. They are always made crispy and come out piping hot.Overall, Donovan's has become an institution in Woodside. After many years in business, they continue to offer great service with food and drinks at a very affordable price. Looking forward to my next trip there!","Tried, true, and possibly the best burger in Queens. But certainly don't forget the Classics like shepherd's pie, chicken pot pie and some amazing homemade fries (regular, sweet potato, and even onion rings).IMHO their only weak point is the draft beers. They have quite a few choices, but I'm getting sick of just Founder's and Montauk being the only 2 IPAs they have, because they're they're both so mediocre.Their burgers always come out cooked to perfection, and tasting great. If you're going to order bacon on your burger, I recommend you ask for the bacon well done.The lovely waitresses, someone thick Irish brooches, are just as awesome as the Ambiance of the place itself. I've been coming to this place since I was 5 years old and it's still awesome!",Best Shepherds Pie! Even better than what I tasted in England. The onion rings are out of this world. And the burger is worth the trip! I recommend to everyone!,Donovan's Pub
531,The new owners have changed the pizza dough recipe and now the dough is not as good. Too bad this used to be the best pizza in Queens.,My fiancé and I ordered a pizza pie for delivery on Friday and were not too thrilled. We ordered half with pepperoni and half with extra cheese with olives on the side. We also ordered two pin wheels. When our order was delivered it didn't come with the pin wheels and the side of olives. Half of the pizza also did not seem like it had extra cheese. The delivery man quickly came back to bring us the missing items. The pin wheels were pretty rough to even bite into. The pizza was barely warm. I think we'll be looking into another nearby pizza place for future orders.,"Let me start off by saying that my family and I have been Lillian's pizzeria fans for over 4 years now. I just recently noticed Lillian's Pizzeria on Uber Eats, which made me excited, because their pizza is so good and since we moved to the north side of the boulevard it's been a bit of a trek to get their pizza, but so worth it. Then I was skeptical, because Lillian and Tony are old school and would never just start delivering without something major happening and I was right, they sold the shop! I looked up reviews to see if things have changed and came across a few mixed reviews on FB about the service and the food. After reading mostly bad reviews, I decided to take the plunge and decided for myself. So, I can't speak to the service, but I can tell you that unfortunately the Pizza is no longer that amazing pizza that Lillian and Tony (and the Latin guys) made. It's such a shame that Lillian's Pizzeria is now just another mediocre pizza shop.",Delicious pizza without hassle. No pretense; only great taste. Love the pinwheels.  A classic.,Great family place with great food and specials must try the grandma pizza .food was fresh and delicious will be going back in the near future. Best of all they deliver,Best pizza in Forest Hills and the new owners have made it better. What a great Margarita pie!,Lillian Pizzeria
532,"2019 UpdateService has gone downhill compared to earlier experiences:  A) Our group got an odd look when we confirmed we would be sitting at the barB) A friend was told that it was not normal to order food before drinks (?!)C) Another friend was ridiculed for taking a few seconds to decide on what she wanted (""Have you not done this before?  Am I in the twilight zone here?"" were the bartender's exact words)I don't like to evaluate an establishment based on one server but it is a reflection of management's priorities, and it looks like several reviews are experiencing bad service here as well, so I hope something changes...",Back again on a Friday. A lot more crowded than a regular weekday. Order a dozen of chicken wings. I was very disappointed. They were almost burn and very dry. Sauces were good.,"Sort of a weird yuppie ""who doesn't know what's happening in the neighborhood"" vibe. Only pub around MOMA's PS1 which is unfortunate. Hit a liquor store before heading out here and grab a bottle, you won't regret it, horrible margaritas and bad service. Fun fact, they give you your check in a little Bierocracy pamphlet detailing the douches who own the place, no self awareness lol.",Great Restaurant! Their Bavarian pretzel was very good! Their grilled chicken sandwich and chicken wings were also very good! Also their sausage plate and their truffle fries were very good! I definitely recommend going to Bierocracy!Here are some pictures for you guys to see,Nice casual beer garden type ambience.  Staff was friendly and even accommodating to a wrong order.  Everyone was pleased with their food (and ),I've had this place bookmarked for awhile and because of a fellow elite member I was able to dine here to celebrate her birthday. The celebration was on a Saturday night and this place was packed. It was expected. If you plan on coming here with a large group make reservations. Our group consisted of 10 people so we got a whole table to ourselves which is great and not so great at the same time. It's great because everyone we knew was in 1 location but not so good when you tried to talk to someone at the end of the table. Our server was awesome. She really paid attention to our table and helped with a surprise birthday slice. You can request separate checks amongst your group ahead of time which is perfect for dining with large groups. Food/Drinks: Since this is a beer garden you can imagine the extensive beer list available. It was pretty impressive. I went with a yummy blood orange cider. The chicken flat bread and the calamari appetizer. All were very good. I wish the cheese on the flat bread melted a teeny bit more but it wasn't bad. The calamari was at a perfect crisp level. Our friend ordered the cutlet and man this thing was HUGE. If you decide to order it plan on sharing with a mate. Once I was done with my beer I moved on to trying an old fashion. Man-o-man! These people know how to make a PERFECT old fashion. I ended up having 2 and would go back for calamari and this cocktail alone.,Bierocracy
533,"Seriously, who ever works the expo station has one job, which is to put customers order together and make sure they get all the condiments, cutlery, and napkins together. What Japanese restaurant doesn't give customers wasabi? Eating sashimi without wasabi is not the same with just soy sauce a bunch of soy sauce. What angers me so much is that I order from them all the time. This is the third time they messed up my order and ruined my appetite. Time to find a other place that value my business. This was my all time favorite place to order sushi. I am so disappointed.","I am only giving it one star because of the horrible customer service I have received from the manager. I placed an order online like I had done in the past. I decided to call the restaurant after waiting for an hour for my order and was informed that they did not make it yet, if fact they didn't even know that an order was placed. They blamed it on a slow internet connection and then they blamed it on being busy. After all of that, they told me that they can only make five out of the eight pieces of sushi that I had ordered and offered me $2 off of what I was already paying. This would mean that I would be paying for seven and a half pieces and only receive five. I did not take this offer. Following that, they offered me another discount (so I would actually be paying for what I would be getting) or credit for my next order. I did not take any of these offers and will never order from this establishment ever again.","We stopped in for lunch and it was pretty quiet, which we didn't mind. Service was a bit slow even though there was only one other table there, but the servers were pleasant. We didn't order any sushi, which seems to be what most of the reviews are raving about, so maybe we missed out, but our lunch was really mediocre--not bad but definitely not good either. My favorite things to order at Japanese places are udon and donkatsu and both were very underwhelming here. I know this is technically an ""Asian Bistro"" but the majority of their menu looks Japanese so I was a bit disappointed by the lack of flavor in the udon soup and the dryness of the donkatsu, which we ordered in the lunch box. Everything was edible but just bland and not particularly yummy.I'm not a sushi eater so I guess I won't be coming here, unless I'm in the mood for mediocre food.",Our first time eating was a delicious delivery to our home.  The food was excellent.  No doubt.  One of the best sushi restaurants around.Food was fresh tasty and well prepared.  Delivery was fast.  It was an amazing experience.Definitely recommend it ordering again tonight!!!,"We always order delivery here when we are craving for Japanese food. They are very fast and most importantly, the food is amazing! My favorites are the Volcano Rolls and Sashimi Deluxe. Very high quality and delicious sashimi and sushi for the price!We've tried all the Japanese restaurants in Sunnyside and I can confirm that TJ is so far the best! I am very glad that TJ is in our neighborhood.","I absolutely love coming here. The sushi and rolls are always great and fresh, the teriyaki is great, the rice is cooked perfectly, and the chicken udon soup on a cold rainy day is just the thing you never knew you needed. The staff is friendly and always there to answer any questions you might have.",TJ Asian Bistro
534,"We chose to celebrate my birthday at Maizal Restaurant, and was incredibly disappointed. Our first time here, we were escorted to the back and given two menus - one for happy hour/specials and another, standard menu. We had hoped to order from the happy hour menu but were told from the waitress that it was only for those guests seated in the front of the restaurant. So, we asked to move, but were told the front was full and we could not. We opted to order a guacamole appetizer which we received without plates or the jalapeño on the side, as requested. We waited nearly 10 minutes for our waitress to come to check on us so that we could request the plates, the forgotten jalapeño, and a second round of water - as we had never gotten a refill since we entered the restaurant. After another 5 minutes passed we could not wait any longer and had to go to the bartender just to get plates and our jalapeño. We never got a refill on water and were never checked up on. At this point we decided to just get the check and leave; only to find an 18% tip already included on the bill. Angela was rude, dismissive, and a terrible server. Absolutely horrible birthday experience; we will not ever be returning.",Wonderful Mexican in Astoria. Only suggestion is to eat there in person- as their delivery isn't nearly as good.,"Went last Friday night and ordered super nachos they were burned I told the waitress and just said ""oh"" no apology neither offered to switch my plate. Had the plantain and shrimps which was good but serving burned food ruined my dinner.  Never going back.","I came here with a group of 8 on a Saturday Night. To my surprise, the restaurant was almost empty.. Which I L O V E D. The table we got was in the center of the back room and it felt as though we were there all alone, super private and did not have to worry about making too much noise.The Margaritas are beyond delicious and S T R O N G.The Shrimp Taco was so fresh however, the rice was a bit too hard for my liking -- overall, i'd get it again though.Parking may take a while so please factor that in when coming here. I was amazed that the servers/staff were extremely accommodating. Only half my total party arrived on time with the rest being 1hr late. They did not give-up our table or fuss about the reservations. They were polite, calm and so understanding. HIGHLY Recommended for groups - 100% would go again.","Stumbled upon this little gem while walking through Long Island City looking for dinner. Let's start off by saying from the outside you might pass it and think this is probably nothing to crazy but step inside and you're immersed into a cozy, heartwarming, palette tickling place. To start off the staff is very friendly always make any place feel warm and they are accommodating for anything you might need, the menu seems all the appetizing and it might seem overwhelming as your mouth waters when you read the description of the plates.To start off I had a classic margarita very smooth and packs a punch but you wouldn't know until you get up! The guacamole was fresh, you can taste the tomatoes, the cilantro and the onions as they dance around in a traditional Mexican style stone bowl.For the main I ordered a Mole Poblano with chicken. It is a great take on this iconic dish and will leave you satisfied as you taste through the chicken with sauce and tortilla. The rice was a nice touch however the beans were not something I would have asked for the next time I order this. Now for the sweet tooth ordered what is an espresso with condensed milk known as the Maizal Bon Bon which is the perfect way to end a meal, also had the order of churros which were amazing!Overall great ambiance and food that hits your palette in such an amazing way will be returning soon!","Came here with a group of friends for brunch on a Sunday and we had a great experience! The service was awesome, and they have a great happy hour for brunch! My friends girlfriend is vegan, and this place was Able to accommodate her and their entire menu is mostly gluten free. They have vegetarian options as well of course! The drinks were perfect and the food was good. I wish the food had some more heat to it, but I understand everyone has a different spice level. The vegan enchiladas were pretty good from what I was told as well as the quesadilla.The chicken and beef burrito bowl were very filling and they're generous with portion size. All in all, a fantastic place to go!",Maizal Restaurant & Tequila Bar

People who complain about what language the staff speaks should concider McDonalds.","The service was good, the side dishes were good , but the noodles and the meat weren't all that great. Very overpriced.",Less variety on the banchans but their focus lies on their meat. Their meat quality is really great. They even have dryaged beef. This place will get you the finest quality meat in bayside- but not the finest Korean bbq experience.,"Unfortunately, my friend and I did not experience the 4 star rating that this place averages.  Space: There are 2 entrances to the restaurant, and we happened to come through the back, which meant we had to walk through the length of this rather spacious restaurant, all the way to the front entrance only to be directed all the way to the back again.  Perhaps they should just have one entrance or have someone at the back door to greet and seat us right away.  Food: We placed an order for the non-marinated galbi with bone-in and bulgogi.  There were just two of us for dinner on Sunday night.  We were told that the galbi was sold out, which surprised us given that this is a BBQ place.  We instead placed an order for the non-marinated galbi without the bone. While the quality of the galbi seemed very good, we were surprised that the galbi was cooked on a stone pan instead of on a grill. The bulgogi tasted like any bulgogi I've had.  Nothing particularly special.  Banchan variety was minimal, and the kimchi in particular tasted like it needed a little more time to ferment.  Service: The person who directed us to our seat was nice enough, but our waitress seemed pretty impatient to have us place an order.  I was with a non-Korean friend and wanted some time to think over what to get.  When we finally did place our order of galbi and bulgogi, she came back to tell us that the bone-in non-marinated galbi was sold out.  Again, given that this is a BBQ place with galbi being a staple I was very surprised.  When we switched to the galbi without bone, we noticed it being cooked on a stone plate rather than a grill.  I didn't want to complain, but I had to later ask why this was so because every other BBQ joint I've been to uses a grill instead of a stone plate.  The second waitress who came to give us our bill told us it was because we didn't place 2 orders of the meat - didn't the other waitress tell us she said?  No, the first waitress did not tell us anything about 2 orders nor did the menu communicate that anywhere. I also had to ask for more lettuce leaves and garlic slices.  We weren't checked on for water or other needs.  And we never received a hot plate like many other reviews mention. Waitresses did not seem interested in really serving.  Verdict:  Needless to say we were very disappointed in the poor service, lack of communication, and ultimately our meal. I've had much better BBQ elsewhere, and I felt bad that my non-Korean friend did not have a good experience with Korean BBQ.  Please treat your customers better.","Wow! Color me impressed. My family of four came here last Saturday to celebrate a birthday, and it certainly did not disappoint. We ordered the beef combo that included the dry aged prime. The meat literally melted in our mouths. We were so impressed with the quality. The banchan isn't as plentiful as most Korean restaurants, but who cares if the meat is good and you get basic BBQ banchan (marinaded green onions and onions, roasted garlic, dipping sauces, kimchi, steamed egg, dwengjjangjjigae). They did also give us some marinaded crab and we loved it. The combo we got also came with a bottle of sparkling water and red wine. The service was top notch, and by the time we left (around 7 pm), there was a huge line in the back. Definitely recommend calling ahead to make reservations. We'll be back!",ChilSung Korean BBQ
536,"Ordered the bad boy, philly cheesesteak, chickastrami sandwiches and a side of onion rings.  Did not like at all.  Everything tasted like it was microwaved and we made a joke that they had all microwaves in the kitchen to prepare the food.  I've had better onion rings at Burger King quite honestly for a fraction of the price.  They seemed like they were made, kept out, then reheated in the microwave.  The gravy lacked flavor.  Very plain and runny.  The chicken didn't even seem like chicken it was sort of stringy and chewy, I can't really explain but it was awful.  Pretty sure the bacon was microwaved, there was no crisp at all.  The buns were black from being burnt. I honestly didn't even want to take pictures of this atrocious meal as I don't want to be reminded of how disgusting it was and how disgusted I am.  :-(","Perfect for late night munchies. They're famous for their heart attack sandwich which is stuffed with chicken cutlet, onion rings, mozzarella and more. It's a must get. Waffle fries are amazing here too, very crunchy. I only come when it's so late that it's the next day (past 12 AM) and even then, there's a line! But the line moves quick since everyone orders basically the same thing. They usually have tables and chairs but sometimes they put it up so that people can just grab and go instead of loitering in the shop. Sadly, the prices have gotten up so it's almost $9 for a heart attack on a roll and almost $12 on a hero.","Finally came by to Cristina deli to try the heart attack sandwich that people started talking about how good it was.First time being here trying their sandwiches. I have ordered heart attack on a roll, anti couch and el diablo on a roll.Anti couch: It's spicy fries with mozzarella cheese and ranch sauce.The sauce were just too much and make it greasy.Fries were soggy not crispy. It says on the front it's spicy fries but it didn't taste spicy at all. Heart attack: the sauce it makes everything good but it's just too much. It says onion ring on the menu. Mine had fries, bacon and fried chicken cutlet.El diablo: my friend ordered that.He said it was just okay nothing special about it.That's that but I had a problem as soon I walked into that deli. There were a guy in the front which looked like he was the owner. If you're tired go home don't be outside standing with angry faces in front. He looked angry, he looked tired. But scared me in the end.It's worth it trying once. I think this place is more high schoolers go for & hang out.This place is not the WOOOOOOOOW place. Overall the food were just full of greasiness. Ate half of my sandwich and few of anti couch.","We went here before watching Avengers: Endgame, so I knew I'd need something epic and filling before sitting in the 3+ hour long movie. I got the heartattack sandwich, which comes with a ton of stuff on it, including chicken cutlet, spicy french fries, onion rings, bacon and melted mozzarella. The special sauce that goes in it is what ties it all together. The sauce tastes like a combination of BBQ sauce and spicy mayo and it has a good acidity/sweetness to counterbalance all the grease and heavy items in the sandwich. Obviously you're not expecting anything healthy in this sandwich and it's super heavy so just know what you're getting into. The service is quick and efficient, what you would expect from any deli/convenience store. The value is really good, as I could barely finish the whole sandwich and it probably would be good for 2 meals. Overall, a good experience for what I was expecting.","I have been coming to this deli for years!! I always come here for the heart attack on a hero. its soo good. They double fry the chicken cutlet to crispy perfection and the special sauce that they use is ridiculously good and the french fries make it a next level. You have to also try the godfather if you don't want something fried or too heavy, its a mix of different cold cuts- ham, turkey, pastrami, salami, etc. Also I always get the couch waffle fries with gravy and mozzarella. Theres many seats and tables for you to sit and enjoy. It can get busy during lunch hours so I would recommend calling beforehand. Also the beauty of this place is that its open 24 hours so after a night out, its perfect!","Found this place which was the only option open late at night around 3 am. It's not your regular deli, this one has seating space so you can dine in. It is self service though. Here's what we tried:The basic- The chicken cutlet is simply out of this world! The flavors would blow your mind away! Perfect combination with the mayo and veggies.Chicken Parmesan- Well, you cant go wrong with chicken parm but this place is something special! Their rolls and heroes are absolutely lip smacking! Definitely visiting again to try more heroes!",Cristina's Deli
537,"Ordered from ubereats False advertising. Basically it's just Chinese food advertised as Thai . Tasted exactly the same as Chinese take out food. There are 4 Chinese food take out places ( I don't wanna call them restaurant) nearby me where I can just call and get free delivery and cheap price. Why spend $20+ for such super bad taste unauthentic ""Thai"" (Chinese) food?Very disappointed when you are craving for Thai food but getting Chinese food instead.","This was my second time ordering from Black Thai, first was a pick, and last week, delivery. From my first experience, I thought the food was decent, but no where near Sri pha, and Ayada. But since we were hungry, and wanted something local, we decided on Black Thai. However, this time, we were very disappointed with the food. Everything was almost cold when it arrived. The noodles from the Drunken noodle was all stuck together, there was barely any chicken in there, and the ones we did get, had tiny bone fragments. The calamari was dried up, and looked disgusting. The chicken wings were no better. Although it had flavor, but that's just from the layers of sauce on top. The meat was tough, and flavor. I will give them 1 more try, maybe it was just an off day for the ""chef"".",Everything is worth of 5 stars except the service. The hostess was really rude. I don't know if she had a problem with our table or what ? Because she was being extra nice with other table. I always come here and this is the first time I got to see and hopefully for the last time too. I LOVE BLACK THAI BUT YOU GUYS NEED TO FIX YOUR SERVICE OTHERWISE YOU WILL LOSE ALL OF YOUR CUSTOMERS,They make this amazing duck wrap with two types of sauces and fried taro strips. Are usually get the pineapple fried rice would either vegetables or chicken. It seems like the cooks change the recipe from time to time it wasn't as savory as I'm used to but still edible. The various appetizers including chicken satay and curry puffs are good.,I ordered drunken noodles with shrimp. They gave me chicken. I'm Pescatarian.  We also ordered pineapple rice with shrimp. It was mediocre at best. Needless to say - never again.,Red Curry was fantastic.  Properly spice with very flavorful vegetables and chicken.,Black Thai
538,Been here a good amount of times..Breakfast is 100%Tried a vegan hero.. It wasn't the best. But the regular sandwiches are A1.It's a go to place whenever the time!,"I have been coming here since I'm 18, I'm now a grown man, and I will die an old man, with a TCS at my bed side. If it weren't for cherry valley, most of us in queens would have died of starvation 1000x at 3am. From us to you, god bless your souls","First issue the girl on the phone was rude, like I was bothering her when I placed my order. Secondly My TCS roll had the smallest piece of chicken ever. How does the person making the sandwich look at that and say, well the chicken covers 50% of the bread so it's fine. It was literally half the roll. This shows they clearly don't care, and for the price of the sandwich it's a ridiculous, and inexcusable. A second piece of chicken should when been added so I'm not just eating bread with cheese. Quality has gone down hill! Very disappointed.","Cherry Valley.. where do I begin? Well probably with ordering the TCS and the Beast. My buddy and I split one of each for dinner last night and let's just say, there wasn't much time for conversation once we started eating. I come here about twice a year so it's kind of a treat.    To my delight, the customer service at the counter seems to have gotten better since my previous visit, which I remember the guy being pretty curt. Well I guess it could also me being a sensitive Pisces too so take that with a grain of salt. Pro tip: Get an Arizona ice tea and also someCheese fries #delicious #regretsJKnoregrets  Pro tip #2: Its definitely a take-out spot so be prepared to devour whatever you get in your car while it's still hot and fresh","This place has a cult following in the NYC area from the things that I've heard, so of course I had to stop by and give it a try when I found myself in the area.  Apparently they've been around NYC since 1979 and their sandwiches have been legendary ever since.  The one sandwich they are known for is the Bushman which is chicken cutlet, bacon, gravy, and american cheese all between two pieces of garlic bread.  It ran me about $10-12 and it was pretty darn good I'd have to say.  The service was quick, friendly, efficient, and overall a pleasant experience.  Sandwich comes wrapped in foil with no branding like most NYC mom and pop shops, the sandwich was very filling and delicious.  I can see why they have a cult following, I'll definitely be back to check it out again and again.  The bread and the sauce was phenomenal, the bread is really what makes the sandwich great.",This place used to be the best. Not anymore! Breakfast sandwiches are not worth it here. Mostly bread.,Cherry Valley Deli & Grill
539,Very authentic polish food and nice atmosphere inside. The food is very heavy and oily but it was tasty.,"#A big Roasted Hock in Beer, which I had with a large beer. #A lot of food and good price. #Tasty",Best polish food in Brooklyn always fresh..I recommend the salmon tartar ..love the decor and the way the waitress dress...only bad thing is that they dont take reservations,"Karczma, where do I begin? Everything in this place is sooo good. When you walk in, you'll see that this place looks very traditionally adorned. There is a full bar to your left, and there are wooden tables throughout the restaurant. The restaurant is a decent size, and has plenty of booth- seating. They have a few tables that are in the middle of the booths, but it doesn't seem like they can accommodate a large party. The menu has very traditional Polish dishes. They have a platter of Polish specialties which I love ordering because it has a mix of some of their popular appetizers: hunter's stew, potato pancakes, stuffed cabbage, kielbasa, and pierogis. They have several different kinds of pierogis (cheese, sauerkraut) but the meat one is my favorite. I recommend getting them fried. The plate of Polish specialties is generous portion, sufficient enough to be an entree for 1 person, or shared appetizer for 2-3 people. For the soup, I recommend the white borscht soup - ask for it to be served in a bread bowl. For the entrees, we ordered a special of the day - the rabbit stew with potato dumplings and a beet salad, and also the spicy beef goulash, which was served on top of potato pancakes. Our favorite part of the meal was the appetizers. We thought the sauce for the rabbit wasn't that flavorful, but the beet salad that it came with was just soooo good and addicting. It was a nice balance of sweet and freshness to cut the heaviness of the meals. My spicy beef goulash was a nice hearty portion, but I was a little disappointed that it wasn't spicy at all (it was good nevertheless).For dessert, we ordered apple pie. Let me tell you, this apple pie was one of the best ones I've ever had, even though they didn't have ice cream here. It had copious amounts of sliced apples, and the crust portion of the pie was dense and cake-like. The pie was drizzled in chocolate sauce, and served with dollops of whipped cream. It wasn't too sweet nor too heavy, but the portion is quite large and is more than enough to share amongst two people. I love coming back here because of how great the food is, but the prices make it even more appealing to come back. Two large beers, one appetizer, two entrees, a dessert, and a dessert cocktail (plus tip) was less than $100, plus we had leftovers to bring home!","I came with my mom on a holiday weekend evening, and we got the last table. We were asked to switch to a smaller table while we were looking at the menu, which we happily obliged because the table we were at was huge for two.Anyway, we decided to share the Polish platter, which came with 1 sauerkraut & mushroom / 1 meat / 1 potato & cheese pierogi, a piece of Kielbasa sausage, one stuffed cabbage with tomato sauce, 2 potato pancakes, hunter stew, and a container of sour cream. To preface my review, the first time I had Polish food was in Poland, so my standards may be a bit high. The food here was pretty good with regards to other Polish food I've had in the US, but of course not as good as in Poland. The pierogi skin was chewy and not too thick, which is rare to find in the US. The meat one had too much meat and it was basically just eating a chunk of meat without any other flavor, and the sauerkraut & mushroom was sticky, which I've never experienced before at any Polish restaurant. I didn't like the stickiness at all. My favorite pierogi was the potato and cheese one because it was flavorful and light. The Kielbasa sausage was quite tasty as well, even though the piece was small. I usually love goblaki, which is the stuffed cabbage, but this one just had way too much meat and too little rice; the balance was off, and there was too little sauce. The potato pancakes were thick and had a great thickness and consistency, but it didn't have much flavor. The hunter stew was really sour and I didn't enjoy it, but I didn't like hunter stew in Poland either so it may not be this particular restaurant's hunter stew that I don't like.It was a lot of food, and service was present. I would say I might return for the cheese and potato pierogi and maybe potato pancakes if they serve it with some flavorful sauce, but I wouldn't return for anything else we had on that plate.Price was quite fair for the amount of food as it came out to be around $16 post-tax.","PURCHASED: Chicken noodle soup + Pierogies w/ that meat covered in cabbage (see photos)TOTAL: $ ~14.00 with t. and t. PROS:+ excellent portion: once again, cannot express how they fill you up. Most restaurants that you go to will make you pay $14 for something that leaves you feeling hungry. In my last review I made the note that I was a moderate to heavy eater. That means I like to eat a lot like a fat american. I hope that says something about what I can handle. + waitresses: are polish. They're straight forward and nice. Owner is a man. + popular spot: I came for lunch at this most recent time. The other times I have come were at dinner. I have missed checking in on multiple occasions. I have really been here plenty of times. CONS:- NothingIMPRESSION:This is a 5-star restaurant because it leaves me feeling heavy--literally the portions are heavy. If it's lunch time, go for the lunch special (first few pages). Choose the chicken noodle soup (SO GOOD, way better than canned generic chicken noodle soup) + the pierogies with the stuffed cabbage. It is bomb and I will certainly come back. Please see photos for the lunch I received. Note: there are other things that you saw photos of that were from other occasions. I do not recommend the Hunter's Stew with a sausage. Karczma is EXCELLENT.",Karczma

The atmosphere is very quiet. It is a perfect place to catch up with your friends. This was the first time I was trying Nepali food. There are so many foods within Nepali food that are variations of other Asian cultures so everything seemed familiar. The food is affordable, filling, and tasty. We ordered chicken momo (Nepali Style dumpling with Chutney), Tama Thali (chicken), and chicken Lollipop. The tama thali was an assortment of different sides with rice in the middle, beans, vegetables, spices, and chicken on the side. The service is perfect. I would definitely come back here.","Sunday Brunch, Apple Martinis, popcorn chicken and Chicken Thali, everything was great!

Definately try the mac and cheese and the chili chicken sandwich!!,"By far the worst place I have ever eaten in NYC. They treat customers like garbage. I recommend staying away from this place.I hope this place closes soon because they don't know basic functions of customer service.Not enough help, no customer consideration and some of the food was disgusting.","The food here is amazing. The burgers, amazing. The jalapeno poppers, delicious. The atomic wings, wonderful. The Addy's signature drinks, refreshing & sugary, love that. What's even more amazing is that it's all HALAL!!! The burger, was so juicy and it felt like the melted cheese was making my taste buds dance the salsa. It was as if I was in harmony with each bite I took. The jalapeño poppers made me smile every bite, such an amazing creation of fried cheese & pepper. The atomic wings was drooled with their special recipe sauce. I danced even more with those wings, I wish I'll have those for my wedding one day some day.

For main, my sister and I shared the Addys Amarillo house burger, with the mushroom sauce- it was amazing..never tasted mushrooms this delicious before.

542,I've been to this place a few times and any day I would have given them 5 stars but yesterday's service was just horrible. I did the bottomless mimosa and I constantly had to ask the bartender for the refills. Not sure how long it's been going on for but the Dj isn't necessary. It's bringing in a young crowd that's messing the groove of this establishment.  The food was amazing. I will see how it is on a Saturday because Sunday wasn't doing it for me at all!,"Really terrible service, and the food isn't any better. We called Saturday to make last minute reservations for Sunday for a group of 17. The person on the phone said they had plenty of room and we'd be seated on the heated patio. Great!We arrived at 2:20 for the 2:30 reservations. It was a minute or so before anyone greeted us and I let the hostess know that we were here for the birthday. She let us know that the heaters broke earlier that morning so we would be sitting inside. I saw them preparing the table so I felt confident we'd be seated shortly. It was wasn't until 2:50 that we were given the table. They have no waiting area so having 17 people stand around was really awkward, especially with how cold it was outside. After we were seated it took a FULL 30 MINUTES before anyone came to our table, and that was after we had been trying to flag someone down. When the waiter came, she started taking orders and was just very dismissive of us. She didn't bring us water or utensils for a long time and when she did, she only brought for half the table!We had about two drinks while waiting for the food and we didn't all get to eat until around 4:20! Unacceptable! The food wasn't even worth the wait - my steak was overcooked and under seasoned and it came with the nastiest scrambled eggs I have ever had (the eggs were hard and overdone). They brought guac as a side (assuming because they forgot to bring beforehand) and that wasn't even good. I will not be coming back to this restaurant ever again. The service and food are not worth it and the staff shows no signs of even trying. I gave Mojave two stars because if you want to get drunk, you can at least do that for $35.","Bathrooms were completely disgusting. No soap, no paper towels. I spoke to the manager about it. Even told him I seen kitchen staff using bathroom in same condition. All he had to say was that it must have been because of the Brunch crowd. Mind you,, i was here for dinner at 6pm. ‍","Booooooooozy brunch! There are two options: $40 for unlimited margaritas, sangria/sangrita or mimosas for 1.5 hrs and includes an item from the pre-fixe menu If you're not in the mood to get too tipsy they also have $20 which includes a pre-fixe item and one drinkI will say....their margaritas are AWESOME! If you haven't tried a sangrita (sangria+margarita meet) you have to try it - won't be disappointed Food: I will say the steak and eggs plate is rather small so if ya love to eat I'd order an app (wings are finger licking goooood) Every other item is plentiful, I had the huevos rancheros with chicken which I couldn't finish! Vibe: The seating outside is cozy and has good lighting for pictures. There was a DJ playing different types of music (Latin, Caribbean, top 50's) Service is a bit slow but they are all nice and make sure you have all you need. All in all- it's a must try spot in Queens!","I hate to write bad reviews, but sometimes you just can't ignore a bad experience.I came here with two friends on Cinco de Mayo.  Chose this spot because it was in their neighborhood.  The actual brunch was fine - my friend and I ordered a regular entree from the bottomless menu (comes with unlimited drinks) and the other friend ordered a regular entree from the pre-fixe one (comes with one drink).  There was plenty of entertainment and we were right next to the mariachi band, which was fun.  Our waiter was extremely slow, but since we were enjoying ourselves, it wasn't a bother.  We requested our checks and it took a LONG time, flagging down bus boys and anyone passing by to ask about it.  When the waiter finally handed it to us, he mentioned he had trouble running our cards through and if there's any issue with our charges, to call tomorrow. At that point two hours had passed and we were running late for our next engagement, so we settled the bill and left.  I thought what we paid was higher than expected, but we had no time to wait forever to flag him down again, so I figured we could resolve it tomorrow as he mentioned.This is when it goes downhill.  Once I got home, I realized we were indeed charged $20 more than we should have been.  Unfortunately, I didn't save the itemized bill, so couldn't figure out what went wrong.  Either he charged my 3rd friend for unlimited (but couldn't be, since we specifically checked that) or he added an automatic gratuity to our bill (which we tipped 20% on top of).The next day and the day after, I try calling Mojave as the waiter asked us to do, but nobody answered the phone and there was no voicemail. Finally, Wednesday since I'm somewhat near the area, I stop by myself to sort it out.  I speak with Denis, the manager, who helps me calculate what the total should have been and it matches what I thought.  He asked me to describe the waiter, which I did, and tells me that he was new and maybe he added the auto gratuity to the bill.  He tries to resolve it at the cashier machine using the copy of my receipt, but comes back to tell me the receipts have already been sent to the credit card company and since I don't have the itemized bill or my friends' receipts, he'll need a few days to get a copy of the bill to resolve it.  He even gave me his card, which I thought was promising, but it just had the same number that I had been trying before.  Thankfully there was an email address on there, so to be safe, I emailed him the copy of my receipt along with all of the details of what we ordered and how much the check was off.After that I did not hear a peep from Denis.  I sent two follow up emails until I decided to give up, as $20 is not worth this headache.  Honestly, it wasn't the money that was the issue, but more the principle of, if you're a business and you mess up, you should do what you can to resolve it or make the customer happy.  If getting the receipt was that difficult, a coupon for a free drink or something of the sort would have at least left me with a more positive perception of the restaurant.  But what I saw was little to no effort to resolve the issue, leaving behind a very unhappy customer.  Will not be back.",Great bottomless brunch! The food was great and the drinks were great! Our waiter was extremely nice. The only complaint Id say the bathrooms are pretty disgusting!,Mojave
543,"Dive bar worthy of any old small town in upstate New York and the patrons to match. Decent prices are about the only reason to come here. If you're a transplant still not used to the big city then i can see why you would connect to this place. For a modern day New Yorker like me, I can't pick one thing to come back for. Service was a little rude, food a bit too generic and vibe a bit too rinky dink for my taste. I'd skip this place and head over somewhere more modern in overall culture.",It's a great place but I will never understand NY. Why they don't care about their customers and what they want to watch. It's not just this place.  I'm watching something on TV and bam they just change the channel. I guess they already have my money so they don't care. It's called customer service.  Ask the patron if they are watching the TV before chaging the channel. I'll never understand.,"I had brunch this past Sunday, Nov 30TH at Cronin & Phelan's I have not been there since this past summer and the Brunch has changed they give you less food and they do not give you anyscones. I had a very young waitress and maybe she was not having a good day and it was earlybefore the crowd came in. They were not very crowded she seemed to be in a very bad mood; however, the service was terrible this young waitress never bought us a check; we had to go and find this waitress she did not even come over to us to see how everything was so we will not be returning to Cronin & Phelan's.","If one asked me where the best Irish pubs were, I'd tell em to take their pick of the ones in Sunnyside and Woodside. Cronin & Phelan's is among several pubs that is making Astoria look really good as a destination for all things Irish, but are they best in the hood? More than likely, yes.The bar is modest but the selection is vast. They have a number of solid beers on tap and a pretty good selection of spirits to boot. The bartenders are all lovely people and coupled with the TVs with sports and the occasional live music, it's hard not to have a good time here. Their usual cast of characters (i.e. the regulars!) can make for good conversation and if one is really good, they might get a drink out of it.Where they really shine is their food. Sure the allure of Irish whiskey and beers are laden at the bar but the quality of their edible offerings far surpass the average pub fare. The shepherd's pie is quite tasty, as is their bangers and mash. I've never been a huge fan of Irish breakfast platters, but their blood pudding is worthy of every bite.Then they have a number of other items, ranging from bar food to Italian classics like a veal marsala and fried ravioli. The burgers are halfway decent, even French onion soup deserves a mention. Every time I eat their loaded potato skins, I question my judgement because I can eat a lot more than the 3 that come in one order.Also, what kind of an Irish pub offers dessert like apple pie a la mode, strawberry rhubarb pie, or a triple chocolate mousse cake? Cronin & Phelan's does. In addition, they have multiple flavors of ice cream and ""Mexican"" platter of sweet plantains, churros, and more ice cream.This place is a kind of venue worth visiting for just about any occasion. Watch sports, eat dinner, drink too much, sing a little karaoke, have a laugh with the crowd, listen to music, night out with friends, etc. The bottom line is there are plenty of reasons to include C&P for any kind of future fun.","This review is strictly for ordering take out. I came in a few days ago when I had a craving for some cozy bar food. I've passed by Cronin & Phelan's many times on my way home but finally decided to stop in. I ordered the Mac and Cheese and a side of fries. The first thing I was blown away by were the prices. They were very decent considering the area! And the portions are very generous. In addition to that, the food came out relatively quickly. The bartender that I ordered from was very pleasant and friendly. I really wanna come back for the full bar experience (food and drinks) sometime soon. The Mac and Cheese was delicious. It was still very hot when I got home and had the comforting ooey gooeyness to it. The fries were good too. They had an option to add on Irish Curry Sauce which I stupidly passed up but will try next time.I can't wait to come back soon!","Great drinks hot good food and great atmosphere!!! We love it here! Every time we come here the owners come around to check on you!! Def recommend this neighborhood gem! BTW: it can get loud because of the bar, but that doesn't bother me a bit!",Cronin & Phelan's
544,"Huge variety of different food stalls. If you're looking for a type of Asian cuisine, this place probably has it. Bring cash, as a lot of the places don't take credit cards.","Caution! If you wanna try KELAIQIN#15 at this food court. Today my girl friend got the green pepper with beef after waiting for 15minutes.However, what we found was that the beef was in low warm and the pepper was like baterry size thick and one side cold which means it was leftovers. When I asked the cashiers, the ladies in front just said their food were all fresh without checking. But a Male worker there who must know the truth got the food back and promised me for a new one. After another 15minutes, we ended up getting a salty, stiff and burnt Green pepper with beef!!! We just threw it away. What a bad day we had. I have never left any comment but I just couldn't keep silent this time. I just wanna tell the fact! By the way, their boiled fish with chili is also quite terrible. Will never visit here.","This food court is full of Chinese food. You get a wide selection of noodles, dumplings, steak, fried squid, popcorn chicken, and bubble tea!","It's hard for me to say whether this food court is better than the other one. I actually think this place might edge out the other one, because it's typically cleaner, less crowded, and has a happy lemon. Of course, the other food court in Flushing has more option, since it's bigger.This place is en route to the mall over here in flushing, so you can stop by here while you're on your way to go do some shopping. There are a lot of good options at this particular place, but I would say you should just try what you feel like might be to your liking. The only place I will say you should avoid is the... well, i'm not sure what it's called in english, but in chinese it's 麻辣香锅, which transliterates to ""spicy numb fragrant pot"". It is actually called dry hot pot, and it's the station where you get you pick all your ingredients and have the kitchen cook and mix it for you. This place isn't bad, but there super common all over flushing, so it's not terribly unique.Other than the aforementioned place, I would say everything else here is good. Again, this is one of only two happy lemon locations, so consider checking that out.","New York Food Court is actually in between the New World Mall and Sky View Mall. You will most likely miss it if you're not too familiar with the area. NY Food Court is very similar to New World Mall food court, but just smaller. Although it's smaller, there are still enough food stalls to satisfy your cravings. You can still find bubble tea,desserts, skewers, dumplings, noodles, ramen, and etc here. This food court became my go-to food court because 1. it's less crowded and 2. I finally found the Taiwanese sizzling steak that used to be in the Flushing Mall. They are known for their sizzling black pepper Taiwanese Steak, which I highly recommend it! It comes with noodles (so yummy!), a side of salad, and sweet tea. Heads up if you order from here they will charge you a $5 deposit for the sizzling hot plates (they will give it back to you when you return your plates).","This place was recommended to me by a friend. It is very close to the SkyView Center in Flushing and is easy to miss. I'd actually walked by this place many times and did not think anything of it. From the outside, you cannot tell how big this Asian food court is. There are at least 15 different stalls to choose from. It is not as big as the food court inside the nearby New World Mall, but it still has a similar selection and is less crowded too. Almost all of the stalls are various Chinese cuisines (Cantonese, Taiwanese, Szechuan, Shanghainese, etc.) with some Japanese, and Korean too. Yes, it is lacking in pan-Asian variety but does offer many different things (noodles, bubble tea, BBQ, rice platters, seafood). Prices are reasonably low at all the stalls too.",New York Food Court 紐約美食城
545,"Had lunch with the family and my kids enjoyed it.. especially My son who is a picky eater. The portions size is perfect, not too much and not too little. The Forma salad was sooo good! Being that it has tuna in it and I am not usually a fan of tuna in my salad, but you couldn't taste it. I loved the pippette ragu and Budino- chocolate caramel pudding dessert.","Everything you want in a fast casual place. High quality every time, quick, reasonable prices. Have been many times and will continue to go back.","Yum! Incredibly: * good* quick* affordableGo. Eat. Repeat. It is cafeteria style, order at the counter and they bring it to you. Not ideal but worth it!","Forma Pasta Factory is a beautifully designed Italian spot located in the heart of Greenpoint offering delicious appetizers, pasta dishes, and salads. I love the fast casual concept here. Patrons can order their food in the front and grab a seat wherever, no tipping required. All their pastas are also made fresh in-house. On my visit with my friend, we ordered the pappardelle bolognese, the tagliatelle scampi, the forma salad, and the arancini (yes we can eat). I absolutely loved both the presentation and taste of both pasta dishes. The pappardelle was simply executed with a bold and flavorful meat marinara sauce. The tagliatelle included sautéed shrimp, white wine, and a lemon butter sauce that brought all the flavors together perfectly. The forma salad was a nice lighter dish to pair with our pastas. I liked the arancini but in comparing it to my other arancini experience from Arancini Bros at Smorgasburg, this does not compare, though it was still tasty. High recommend checking this place out!","Pipette Ragu - 4/5Spaghetti Pomodoro - 2/5Cauliflower - 4/5Hygiene - 1/5The dishes are small by nyc standards, so don't expect to leave full! I wanted to love the sht out of this place and have been meaning to dine here for months since I grew up and live in an Italian neighborhood, I know what good Italian food tastes like.The pipette ragu was tasty, I would've preferred my pasta to be a bit more on the softer side though. The spaghetti pomodoro, reminded me of a slightly tastier version of chef boyardee's sauce, because it had that same level of sweetness, but had more of a flavor depth to it that I can't quite explain. The meatballs are surprisingly, freaking small, but bigger then the chef boyardee version. Personally, I wasn't fond of this dish.Side of cauliflower that had tasty sauce, HOWEVER, and this is a huge no no and costed stars from me due to unhygienic food handling: The person who took care of the garnishing, plated the cooked cauliflower with his bare hands, that's right, SANS gloves, and placed the garnishes on top, then served directly to me. NYS law prohibits bare hand contact with ready-to-eat foods!","Absolutely lovely. Pasta was the best I've had in awhile. I wanted to try everything but they were making a batch of meatballs that smelled so good I figured I should start there. It was a good call. The spaghetti was cooked to a perfect al dente. I was pleasantly surprised to see smaller meatballs instead of 1 or two huge ones. The sauce was well balanced and not overly salty or acidic. Delicious, and I don't feel like I need a nap afterward. The service was great and the space is cute. Glad to have them in the neighborhood!",Forma Pasta Factory
546,"Update since last review. New experience with Chick-fil-A. I took another chance with a different franchise {Staten Island }Get the kids meal, choice of 3 things not for big appetites but for a quick bit it works for me. ALSO I buy chicken that is breaded so it moves isn't sitting out. So far they are getting it right. Very pleasant staff, clean, they even come over when they are not busy and ask if everything is ok.I was very harsh in my last review, after the food poisoning. I still say cooperate didn't handle it the right way but gave them another chance, this franchise is totally different. Thumbs up!","I was very offended when I acquired food poisoning at the Queens Center location. I was offended by their insurance company. First it was never my intention to file a claim BUT the right thing to do would have been to ask what I ate, what time and take it off the shelves.Instead some fake southern charm phony  called me almost almost immediately and  started with 90 questions. All defense mode about my insurance, did I see a doctor to many questions about my personal life and no one how are you feeling. I REPEAT I was so sick I couldn't even GET to my doctor! I guarantee you every women in the restroom heard me vomit non stop I was so weak and dehydrated. Yes it was right after I ate Chick filet. Moral of the story is the persona of being a Christian family run biz that is closed on Sundays to spend time with family and God is a complete fake!! Maybe the owner had thoughts years ago but Queens Center Mall does not live up to the image  the image of caring, Christian and kind. .Their insurance company was viscous with a sweet southern accent, told me I did not get sick there. In fact I did they take your name and the time it's all on record. Bottom line I wouldn't eat there again, if they were kind and pulled the food so that NO ONE ELSE got SICK I would have felt better. Their attitude and lack of validation left a bad taste in my mouth. They are just another viscous corporate chain that is all about portions and control.","The grilled chicken sandwich called for an update to the review, as the meat was actually quite tender and the bun was flavorful; presentation was more palatable compared to the insipidity of the Chick-fil-A sandwich.",This was my first time at this chick-fil-a. After all the years I have been coming to QCM I have never been to this branch on the food court in QMC.I have to say I was impressed by how many people were flocking to chick-fil-a. They had a nice size line there .But me and my wife said we would wait on it.the line moved pretty fast .we got up there and put in our order in a nice gentleman buy the name of Anthony. Took our order and took my name .he was very friendly and courteous the whole time. We have to give a major shout out to him.So my order was the spicy chicken breast deluxe sandwich with there honey mustard sauce on the side .I have been hearing so much about this chicken sandwich challenge. So I hade to get in on it .I tried all the other restaurant chicken sandwiches so I going to give chick-fil-a a nice try. It did not disappoint at all it had the right seasonings the bun game was excellent nice and soft. It could have been a little more crunchy then I would have gave them a 5 stars.but it was a very good tasting sandwich. And the had some really good honey mustard sauce. So my wife had a chicken sandwich and the macaroni and cheese .I got a chance to taste the macaroni and cheese and it was the bomb. It didn't disappoint at all .she loved it..we compared it to some soul food restaurant and it had a better taste.i would have to say this place lives up the hype. I would definitely go back to this location. I believe this is the only chick-fil-a in queens. .,"Can get very crowded! I like they have the grilled chicken nuggets,  they are delicious but tiny so I woukd recommend to order the 12 piece once.  Seems they offer more healthy options that any other fast food restaurant!","I like their 12 pcs chicken nuggets. The fries are good but really salty, and the sauces they give you are so good too. My favorite is honey mustard and spicy siracha.",Chick-fil-A
547,Fast delivery just not that goodOverpriced burgers..Wendy's tastes better for a lot less.,"This place was such a disappointment. Every single dish we ordered was incorrect. - Mozzarella sticks with no marinara sauce. - Impossible burger, no tomato, onion, or aioli. - Fish sandwich, no pickled cabbage. - Greek salad, no mushrooms(additional $1). I called the location to inform them of the mistakes and the customer service was awful. The manager claimed that the menu had changed and these items don't come with this anymore! Mind you, the seamless menu AND their website's menu don't reflect any of these changes. The manager then continues to say she 'put the marinara in the bag herself' as if I was lying about that detail!That employee left such a bad taste in my mouth, I can not say if the food was good or not.","Unbelievable, walked into this place nobody even acknowledged me. Place was empty, staff minding their own business! Will never be back. Walked out hungry and mad!","Ever since they opened, I've been ordering from that spot. I finally decided on a Saturday to go there in the afternoon! We were seated as they didn't have much customers there at that moment. (By the time we left couple tables were already taken) Their delivery service is always on time and sometimes earlier than expected.Brought my girlfriend as it was the first time she was having it. I have tried their tenders, burgers, chicken sandwich, sweet potato fries, mac & cheese and wings. Let me tell you! Oh My God ! The ribs are a must as they added it to the menu couple months ago. You will not regret it guaranteed! Definitely got yourself a regular customer that will keep coming back!","Ordered Delivery through seamless, it was super quick but unfortunately the food wasn't good. The fires are cooked wayyyyy too much, they are almost burnt so unless that's the way you like you fries it's not worth the $4. Also, I paid extra for cheese on my burger and didn't get it unfortunately. The burger is not good enough to stand on its own without cheese. I ordered it Medium and it was definitely closer to medium rare which I kind of expect in restaurants like these. As I prefer medium rare but knew it would be raw.The milkshake was delicious you could actually taste the Oreo which was nice. Overall, I don't recommend their food but if your dropping by for a milkshake go for it!",Mac and cheese burger was awesome .its a huge amount of mac and cheese on top of a flame broiled burger with bacon .so good i couldnt finish it! Also the garlic parmesan fries are delicious just have some mints for later.Will be back soon to try the other items on the menu!,ECB Burgers
548,Good food but horrible service.. this new server taking orders and all over the place then come another server and she is as horrible as the the first guy..I like the food and the environment except horrible service..,"CHEESE. BOAT. My husband and I visited for lunch and were excited to experience a bread boat filled with cheese. Said cheeseboat met all expectations and was delicious. However...we overestimated how hungry we were and also ordered a side of fries. We assumed they would be New York-sized. They were not. That basket could've easily fed four people. We did our best to finish our food but failed miserably. Then we mistakenly walked around Brooklyn for the rest of the day. It wasn't the best start. I'd suggest visiting Cheeseboat before a casual night in, perhaps wearing sweatpants.","Prosciutto Cheese Boat was ok, definetily wasn't the best. The taste got tiring and honestly soooo much money for something that tasted just ""ok"". Wouldn't really go back.","Oh wow.  If you love melted cheesy goodness and Eastern Europe like I do, this is the spot for you. Dishes and wine from Georgia.  Came in around 1pm on a Saturday, seating for 5 was easy. Decent size seating area with bar in the back left corner. If all the tables are full, it could be kinda tight at the tables. Front windows open fully and some sidewalk seating. I enjoyed the red wine we had with lunch, but for others it was a bit too sweet- the blackberry note.  Three of us shared a Cheeseboat- a boat made of bread filled with gooey hot melted mozzarella and feta, then topped a with butter and an egg. It was like an open faced epic grilled cheese.  I was in heaven!! The Kundari- cheese-less meat pie was unexpectedly huge, the size of a medium pizza. Flaky layers of pastry with a thin purée layer of meat and spices. Service was great. Table just a little sticky.","Had a reservation for 6 , at 8:45 . When we arrived the table was not ready .   Mushroom dumplings were gross , hope I won't get food poisoning.  Also had khinkali with beef , if you now how the real Georgian food taste like , you will be disappointed. Wine was ok , but the quality and price just don't match .  The worst thing , we had to leave in an hour and half , cause nobody told that restaurant closes at 10 .","Beware! They have changed their brunch menu as of one week ago and not updated it online. A group of friends and I came, eager to try the various different cheeseboats only to find that their menu had drastically changed and they no longer serve cheeseboats until after 4 PM. This change with lack of update onto their website is the primary reason to knock their stars down. There was very little flexibility in accommodating to us based on our disappointment and expectations except that they could make the regular cheeseboat. Some of us got the regular cheeseboat which was very delicious and freshly made. Others tried the pumpkin French toast and pear salad, which were also good.",Cheeseboat
549,"For lying about their food menu This place deserves the 1 star review. I went here on a Sunday. The wait was short 5minutes which is appreciated. There are a lot of carbs of course. The drinks are very limited. They asked me if I wanted water or tea so I opted for the tea. The seafood selection is very limited. They are of course frozen. Such as shrimp and fried scallop in batter. Nothing is really fresh even the sushi. We ate for about 1.5 hour and they never replenish the pumpkin soup which I wanted to try. The soups are very salty. They did not appeal to me one bit. I did tried the crab soup. There are no crab meat in there so its a false advertisement. There are a lot of carbs if you like. The fishes are either over salted, dry or overcooked.The meat are too overcooked especially the beef. Which was the only palatable beef there in the buffet. There are some varieties of sushi. They are all stuffed with a lot of rice. Otherwise would be decent. There are raw clams. Not fresh and I would not recommend. The dessert section is small and they played it very safe. Each piece are tiny bite size. Overly sweet, spongy and nothing indifferent.They do not have ice cream but instead some gelato. There were two flavors, mango and vanilla.Most disappointed about the fact that they stated ouster and uni are on the menu. There is ABSOLUTELY no ouster nor uni being an option.","My family and I will never eat here anymore because of the rudeness we got last Sunday. It was my Dad's birthday and they made it the worst day to celebrate it.We always go here because they have good food as you can see on my previous review I gave them 5 stars.This is what happened:We came here exactly 11:30 and we are the first in line. As soon as we enter, this guy named Andrew ask if everybody is here, without any welcome or anything. My nephew who is 7 yo will arrive in about 10 mins, so we ask if we could already sit down. Andrew said we can't because we have to be complete and there is a time limit. We fully understand that, but do a 7 year old kid will eat in 1.5 hours? And besides the way Andrew spoke to my sister is wrong. He was screaming to my sister, like are you kidding me? Is this the way you treat your customers?? My nephew arrived and my sister showed him to Andrew and still Andrew is fighting with my sister.This place ruined our Sunday family day, specially it ruined my Dad's birthday. Even my nephews does not want to go here. I will never go back here even if they pay me.","We went to on a Friday afternoon.   It's a school holiday.  Arrived at 12:45.   Lunch is up to 3 pm.  It was crowded with waiting people, inside and outside.   Got a table in 30 min.  Children charged by height.  Senior discount $2 off.  Ask for cash option.   Pro: -Spacious self free parking lot-Fresh food including Sushi- most dishes are delicious Con:  -8 of us ( including 2 children) were taken to a 6 person table.  Two kids were squeezed into one end of table.  We were told an extra table would be added when available and of cause that didn't happen.  - I know they are busy. But they need to come around for refilling and removing dirty dishes more often, especially we have no room to put two plates in front of us in a small table. -Slow refill in most entrees.   Waited for lobster ragoon for 15 min with no luck. See my photo - Wet floor when the staff walked out of wet kitchen everytime.  - No WiFi! Tip:  ask for cash optionConclusion:  Slow refill of entrees.  To get food is a hit and miss.   Lunch price starts @ $21 with dinner price up to $35.  Not my favorite place due to service and slow replenishing.   May return once in a blue moon for lunch only.","Buffet perfection! This has it all. A clean,  well cared for,  busy buffet with staff that keeps the plates and tables cleaned away. Sushi options that will make your head spin. It is all there. Rolls, sashimi, small poke plates. Salads, cooked foods, soups, seafood, beef, pork, chicken, many types of fish.  And desserts. Definitely a great place to dine. Spacious seating, great parking.","I've gone here with my family numerous times for over 5 years already, so I'm pretty familiar with this establishment.Price: It's definitely way pricier than the average Asian buffets I've visited, but the quality of the food and decor /is/ higher than average. Is this boost in quality worth the higher price though? Not exactly.Food: The dishes seem to have a mix of Japanese and Korean influence. Personally, I feel that the quality/wow factor of the hot foods have declined over the years and isn't anything impressive. It's mostly just fried foods.The cold foods/salads look and taste fresh (that's a plus) and some of the salads are fun to the palate! Like salmon egg salad, mango jicama, etc.They do have a vast arrangement of different kinds of sushi and rolls, which is better than only having your average California Roll like some other buffets do. They have sashimi, tataki, live clams, cocktail shrimp, mini poke bowls, etc...all a delight to have! This is where the price best goes to at Mizumi! (During dinner hours, they also provide crab legs.)The soups and dessert are nice; no complaints but no praise.Decor: The tables are not cramped and there are walls dividing up diners in sections. There's music playing in the background. The bathroom is pretty clean.Service: Waiters/waitresses are okay. Things get done. They'll also remind you when your 1.5 hour limit is up.Overall, Mizumi is alright and worth coming to on an occasional basis. Lunch hours seem more worth it than dinner hours though.","A lot of people recommend this buffet place and it was good! All of the food here is delicious!Location: it is located in bayside area. There is a huge parking, i believe it get filled up during the weekend because a lot of people go here. The interior is okay, a little too small for a lot of people.Service: They were nice, because of the crowd and small place, we asked them to change our table and they place as to a better table (we have 8 in the family). Our server was very nice! Does not hurry you up but there is 1.5 time limit.Food: Everything for me is delicious!! Wide variety of KOREAN and JAPANESE food! My favorite was the seared ahi and white tuna!! They were the bomb!! The sushis and sashimi are good too, a lot that I can't try them all. They have bulgogi and udon as well! The desserts are like the typical you can get on a buffet. But everything is moist and delicious, they just have to present it well. My favorites are banana cake, carrot cake and german chocolate!Price rating: 7 out of 10. Pay with cash and it is cheaper!I will definitely come back here!! Just that it is only 1.5 hours! Get the seared tuna! So delish!",Mizumi
550,"I created a Yelp account to write this review because the experience was so truly awful, I do not want any other Astorians to go through what I did. By far the worst dining experience I've ever had. I had ordered here several times and not had the greatest experience (charged for undelivered items, called and never received refunds), but thought I'd give eating in the restaurant a shot (so dumb). My fiance and I came here on a Sunday for brunch, and waited over an hour and a half for our food, and the wait staff didn't check in on us once. Our food arrived. There was a hair in mine (photo). I went up to the bar and whispered to a waitress about it. Our waiter showed up at our table said, ""Well, what do you want?"" very aggressively. I said, ""well I guess just for these pancakes to be comped?"" He walked away angrily with the plate, and then someone else appeared and slammed the bill (everything but the pancakes) on our table. Nothing else had been deducted. I was violently sick once I got home, and so was my fiance. Do not go here, do not order here. I don't want anyone else to go through this and waste money.","This was, without question, the worst dining experience I have ever had. I almost feel like I must have been pranked, because how this restaurant has more than one star is beyond me. Between the terrible service and the even worse food, we will never be returning. You can stop reading now, but full story below.Upon arrival: the restaurant is very crowded and we see two waitresses running around. No one greets us, so we stand awkwardly by the door. Finally we're able to flag down the coffee barista who tells us it will be a fifteen minute wait. We see an open table, but assume someone is still using it. 15 minutes later, they realize whoever was at that table was, in fact, gone and slowly bus it. Once they table was bussed, we had to ask if we could sit down because no one told us to.We sit down. Another 15 minutes go by as the waitress runs around us. No water put on the table, nothing. She finally arrives and tells us she is so sorry, they must be the only place open (New Year's Day). No, it's just a heavy brunch day- we thought this was common knowledge, but apparently this restaurant didn't know. Ah, the slowness starts to make sense. She takes our order: Coffees, Chorizo Baked Eggs, Cheddar Grits, Tortilla Soup, and a CUP of the Buffalo Chicken Mac and Cheese. A bit all over the place, but it was our first time and we wanted to try things!45 minutes later, burnt/too strong coffee, no food, and no one has checked in. I asked for more water at one point and she forgot about it.Food arrives: The Buffalo Mac and Cheese has unseasoned fried chicken on top, but looked bigger than cup size- exciting we thought...until we tried it. Bland chicken, a weird tobasco flavored cheese sauce and undercooked pasta. The Chorizo eggs were so over done, they seemed to have a plastic film over them- inedible and the whole dish tasted like canned tomatoes. The Tortilla Soup didn't seem to have any flavor- did they use plain water as the broth? And the grits were soupy and had no seasoning whatsoever. Inedible.We didn't eat much of anything and we flagged the waitress down for the check because we just wanted to get out of there. She asked if we wanted boxes and when we said no, she was shocked. We told her we did not like anything and she kept saying that people normally love the food. How?! She was very sweet and comped the Chorizo Eggs. On the check, I was charged for the BOWL of Mac and Cheese, so I had to ask her to change that. (Apparently the large cup was the bowl portion, but how would I know?) It was all very awkward and terrible. Never again.","Service here is so rude. It took me about 8 minutes to become acknowledged. Four people were on staff, and we were the only people standing in the doorway. I came here this Sunday afternoon at around 2pm. When I found out that we wouldn't be able to sit down for at least 30 minutes, we decided to have tea to go, and I had a croissant. The woman behind the counter was treating me as if I was ridiculous for not knowing where anything was. When I didn't see where she put my croissant, she had a huge attitude. When you have a business, the personality and character of the people the business hires is so important. When I asked where the croissants were made, she made a face and said ""here"" in a sarcastic manner. Milk was warm for my tea. They were not serving freshly squeezed orange juice but had a fancy set up with oranges next to the machine. I will never be back. So many places in NYC to have brunch.","This was an amazing find in this neighborhood. The vibe that this place gave me was very calm. I felt like I was on a vacation in some tropical island. Everything we ordered was just delicious. The eggs on that biscuit was just delightful. And my partners French toast with fresh strawberries were perfectly cooked with light crisp and sweet at the same time. Love it. Now with the Cons or just one CON:I agree with many Yelpers/customers here that this place definitely needs more servers on the floor. I mean, the food was just amazing. It's definitely my go to spot right now but I would hesitate a little due to service being slow. The server who served us was amazing. When we were there it was just 1 server and 1 chef doing all the work. The server was just running around trying to make sure everyone got his attention while making drinks at the same time. That's  a recipe for disappointed customers.

551,"Sad to say I bragged about this place to my family and convinced them to try it out.  They ended up agreeing to try the place out.    Unfortunately since the minute they pulled into the parking lot two employees were smoking out there, they step inside their expectations were even lower no one was in sight not a host/manager/waiter.  To my surprise the Have a B rating on the window.   Now I felt bad and started wondering why.   Well the service was awful, felt rushed.   Now the food wasn't great either no taste to it, the filet mignon tasted like freezer burn and like it had been just defrosted.  We didn't eat it and they didn't care to switch it or do anything about it for that matter so about 6 dishes of meat were not touched.   We had a cake for our birthday boys which was brought out unannounced while the whole hibachi table was still full of dirty plates and empty cups all over not only that  we had decided to have their dessert instead  but never provided a dessert menu.  (Rushed again) So we had to move around the used and dirty dishes to take pictures.  Upon asking to please clean up our table.   Finally the ""manager"" came over while the table was stilll dirty and wanted to proceed to cut the cake with an attitude .    (That was obviously melting because they put it on top of the hibachi grill) .   Again we asked to please remove the empty cups and plates.    She walked away and never sent anyone.  We waived down a busboy he brings over the bucket to put the empty cups and dishes, while he is doing that another waiter comes by grabs him and he leaves now the dirty bucket on top of our table.   Overall it was a poor poor experience.  And please your menus are not disinfected to be placed on top of the dishes the tables are set up with.","Where's Gordon Ramsey when you need him?GOOOORDDDDOOOONNNNNN!Saturday night around 7, I call Nikko and ask if they take dinner reservations. I spoke to a woman named Joey who said they did. She asked me at what time I would arrive and I said 9 PM. Done.My boyfriend and I arrive about 8:50 PM. We were seated at 9:45. INEXCUSABLE.Definitely not a good introduction to a restaurant. Won't be back.","Had such a horrible experience with the service, we were treated so horrible by the waiter, he was very disrespectful and very unpleasant, while we were celebrating a birthday dinner we called him over to ask him for a drink and he got offended for us calling him over to do his job, customer service is non existent in this place and he had the nerve to disrespect the customer for calling him over in front of children. Disgusting disgusting disgusting never again,  is that  the  reason to come over and make a big deal about a simple order question? And besides the manager all he said was sorry wow!","Really great place to go with your family and friends just to give hem a show. The food in particular is delicious though I've only gotten the hibachi. The staff seems very nice tho only thing that i would say is that it's a little expensive if you go during dinner, i recommend going for their lunch and happy hour specials, it's much more worth it. Again it's a really great place for a show, someplace fun to take your parents near sju.","Where do I start? I was recommend here by my friend .....  he swears by this place and after a year long invitation, we have finally arrived. I arrived at 6:57pm on a Sunday with a party of 12 and the host told me 25 minutes of wait. Well, we waited until 8:10 and it's not until I asked again did they finally seat us. We are not off to a great start so far...... Fast forward.....Hibachi chef was nice but not skilled, no flaming volcanoes, no heart shaped fried rice, no knife tricks....Just threw a few pieces of food for us to catch and that was it. Sushi was decent, hibachi food was decent although it was a bit salty and greasy. Waiter sucked. Never took away emptied soup bowls, appetizer plates, never came back to check for water....... just pure trash. I was originally going to give it 1 star, but since the food wasn't too bad I increased it to 2 stars. I probably won't be coming here again.  Also, water keeps dripping on me from underneath the hibachi counter ...... nasty Friendliness: 1/5Cleanliness: 3/5Deliciousness:3/5Price: $$$","Very good place relatively new! I've visited it several times already with different occasions, now time to leave good review! Very happy with it. You can come for hibachi, to order a la carte or just seat in the bar, they have huge bar. Services are great! Back ago when i used to eat meat i've always ordered steak hibachi- THE BEST steak hibachi is here- soft juicy - just perfect! 3 days ago i took mixed seafood hibachi- scallops, shrimps, lobster- was great as well! I absolutely love hibachi chef entertainment while cooking! And sake on the house is great ( not for everyone, just when you drink a lot ! ) I do recommend this place for all- good for family dinner, kids, date, friends, birthdays etc. Very well done! Offer a lot for this very local area! Clean and amazing ambiance! 5 stars only!",Nikko Hibachi
552,"Went here for both lunch and Omakase dinner.  So far, this is probably the only place I recommend for full course tasting experience that is considered fancy in flushing.",When this place first opened up. I loved coming here every week for omakasu. Now it's become more popular their chef and ingredients changed. It's still good for high end sushi but not like what it use to. Attached photos are the food when I first came here when they opened up.,When this place first opened up. I loved coming here every week for omakasu. Now it's become more popular their chef and ingredients changed. It's still good for high end sushi but not like what it use to.,"I'm kind of shocked that I never wrote a review for Iki, I've been here many times over the years since they've opened. TLDR: Modernistic Japanese cuisine. Tasty but pricey. Good place for an expense kind of dinner if you're in the area or... if you just got it going on like that.I started eating here late nights for sushi/sashimi. I've done their tasting menu once and I will say - it's very lux type of dining. It is a lot of food. The tasting menu was $95 when I went. Their cooked dishes are more of their strong point IMO.Noteworthy recommendations though are the Scallop with Foie Gras and Maitake Mushroom. I actually crave this quite often, it's an expensive appetizer for $12 but the execution is flawless. The Uni Foie Gras Toast, that's around $20 if I remember. The Spicy Lobster, circling around $35~ or so. It is damn good though.The sushi and sashimi is decent, probably better quality for the area but if you don't mind the travel - I think there are better options to be found in Manhattan or further East in Queens.","I was going to give this restaurant a 5 star review since I've been to this place multiple times, but due to last night's experience, I knocked down one star. I'll start with the good stuff first. This is a pricey restaurant, so be ready to splurge yourself. First of all, their sushi is very fresh compared to your typical Flushing sushi. However, you can also get great sushi with quality like this or even better in Manhattan for about the same price. I really enjoy their lunch specials although they are priced than your average lunch special at about $22 for sashimi lunch special. However, this is considered a bargain in comparison to their regular price menu. I must agree with many other reviewers that their toro sashimi isn't the best. It's not the worst either, but I felt that it was very average compared to what you would expect from toro sashimi. However, their salmon and their raw shrimp have always been great. Uni foie gras on toast - very good ! It tastes creamy and melt in your mouth from the uni. You need to eat it in one bite though or else it's going to get messy and you won't get all the flavors together. Don't worry - it's a small piece of toast - you can do it. Caviar Uni lobster - what a winner here. I'm a huge fan of uni so whenever there's uni, I'm there. The raw lobster tastes very similar to raw shrimp tbh with a slight difference. Either way, it complimented each other very well.Now, let's talk about the bad experience last night. First of all, do not order their omakase that's priced at $110 or $130 per person (2 different menus). There were things that we wanted from both menus so it was hard to decide which to go with but we went with the $110 one. All their portion sizes are much smaller than your regular portion size when you order a la carte. I know this because I've been here several times and have ordered the same exact dishes as what's on the omakase menu. The wagyu beef on the omakase menu was SO thinly sliced that it was almost non-existent. AND they forgot to give us the 3 different salt condiments on the side to pair with. We were wondering why it tasted so bland, but I remembered later when I got home that I had the same dish a few days ago and they served that salt on the side which we didn't get last night! That caviar uni lobster that I've talked about before was literally half the portion size of a regular one. With that being said.... I suggest you to just order from their regular menu especially if you know exactly what you want. To me, the omakase menu was not worth it. It's not that cheap and you don't even get the same quantity/quality as if you're ordering regular dishes. The part that got me really upset last night (and this is also due to my own newbie naive nature when it comes to ordering seafood) is that we asked the waitress what's the MP for Dungeness Crab. She said $30 something per pound. We thought okay $30 is fine let's do it! Bill comes: it's $58. We were shocked and then when we questioned about it, they said of course it can't be 1 pound. Okay, that is true now that I think about it. However, I also specifically said to the waitress ""let's get 1 pound of that crab."" She did not correct me on that statement and could have told me that it's going to be more than a pound. I certainly would think that they should tell you the more realistic price of the crab before you order it! I also heard from some other more experienced seafood diners that they technically should show you the crab BEFORE they cook it and tell you approximately how many pounds it will be, which they did not either. I felt like I was jipped and taken advantage of for knowing these kinds of ""common knowledge"" When I brought that to the manager's attention, he did little to compensate for it. I also said to him you should tell the waitress to tell your customers the right price upfront when it comes to these things so there is no confusion. The manager did not do much about this and all he said was that if you pay cash, it would be cheaper (tax evasion). That was it. So just be AWARE of this guys - always ask approximately how many pounds of seafood they will give you and do the math in your head. This isn't like Naked Crab or other seafood joints where they will give you exactly the pound of seafood you request for.Anyway, this is definitely more of an upscale japanese restaurant in flushing. However, I still think the ones in Manhattan are better. I've also heard from many people that their omakase menu has decreased in quality and value. They are also not true omakase where they have the chef present you each dish as they make them. It's not the typical omakase experience you would at other japanese restaurants, so just be aware of that. Lunch specials are a great deal here since they come with many other side dishes. This place is worth checking out if you're looking for some decent sushi in Flushing.","DO NOT ORDER ANY ROLLS! It's reasonably priced but not worth it. Do try everything else! Ermahgah! I was impressed how 'Japanese' a Chinese-run restaurant could be, they usually add some ""Chinesque"" traits (real word?). Wagyu hot stone was most worth it! They gave us different salt options to dip into which I absolutely salivated over. Go for the bigger portion, you'll be satisfied! Tako Wasa - your typical tako , it wasn't anything different from what I've had but it was still very good.Uni lobster - it's like eating a seafood ice cream! So goood. Toro caviar - man, that menu photo looked so plentiful but when it actually came, it was itsy bitsy. Almost comical of how different the portion size was but it was still really good. Perfect on the toast. Why do we need butter if we have toro? Uni Foie Gras - this was a very creamy/fatty appetizer. It was definitely delicious but I'd suggest have some bread with it as wellCold soba - this is all I came here for cause I was cravingSoba but after all the prior flavors I already consumed, having such a clean dish wasn't worth it. Also, the soba soup/sauce had some oil residue, I'm not use to seeing that for soba so I wonder if the bowl was just dirty.... Lobster roll and scallop roll - had very thin slices of meat laid on top. Not sure if the lobster roll was stuffed with shrimp meat or lobster meat but either way, not worth it. I would steer away from the rolls. Had nothing going for them. Okra - simple dish. Nothing special. I just like okra :) Sake - the definition of Kubota Manju just sold itself so I got a bottle and I'd suggest it. The waiter also said it's really popular in Japan. The BIGGEST annoyance throughout our whole meal were these two damn flies that kept flying around our food and us having to keep waving them away. I don't know how other restaurants keep flies away but to pay so much money at this place to get ruined by flies really sucked.",Iki Modern Japanese Cuisine
553,"This place is terrible, looks good from the pictures the restaurant put up on yelp but they are extremely deceiving, the drinks are watered down and taste like toilet water the burger is stale and burger buns are hard like a rock ...if I could leave 0 stars I would ... go at your own risk Ps. It's a cop bar ..",My friends and I ordered 3 frozen margaritas and one frose. All 4 drinks were disgusting. They literally tasted like frozen water with lime & a teeny tiny drop of alcohol. There was no difference between the mango margarita vs the strawberry vs the frose except the color. When we told the waitress she said the bartender usually won't remake it but she would ask. She asked and he refused. She said it's bc we ordered them frozen and that's why they tasted like water. It's a shame bc the biergarden looks nice but they need to train their bartenders on how to mix drinks properly.,"French fries SHOULD NOT cost $7.50!!!! No small plate of A SIDE of French fries should ever cost that much. Once I got the bill for the fries, I looked at the menu and saw that everything is wayyyy overpriced. This isn't the city yet to order a pretzel, you're paying more here than at the Standard Beer Garden in the famously over priced Meat Packing District. This bar is located above a very busy train and bus hub; not Austin street, not NYC. Maybe that's why its a ghost town most nights I walk by it.","I've come here for dinner in the main bar/restaurant once and been in the beer garden another time.  I really enjoyed the food and the beers.  When dining inside, service was really slow (it was Taco Tuesday and they seemed overwhelmed) but everyone was really friendly...just took forever to get two tacos.The beer garden was great.  Service was super fast, the back area is really comfortable and a great spot for groups of friends.   I'd definitely go back to the beer garden.",I'm torn bw a better review based on tasty food and atmosphere and the managements abuse of plastic (cups n straws)enjoyed the game area on the patio and old school remixed pop/hip hop music. happy hour is great esp when you being pals and consume a bunch! CANT USE AMEX to pay,"It was our usual Friday date night and I decided to take my hunny here. It's a casual pub that serves American fast food such as appetizers, salads, soups, wings, sandwiches, 1/2 pound burgers, entrees, beer and spirits. We ordered Chicken Quesadilla, Sweet Potato Fries, Philly Cheesesteak Eggrolls, and Steak Tidbits. We also order a Corona and a Blue Moon. Our beers took way too long to come out. By the time we received them I forgot they we placed an order for them. Everything was delicious but a bit overpriced for the portions we received. My hunny wanted sweet potato fries instead of the fries that come standard with the Steak Tidbits. Our waitress told us that she didn't have a way to sub the sweet potato fries on the computer. I found this odd because we've been to plenty of places that will do it with a up-charge. I ended up ordering him a separate order of the fries because that's what we had a taste for. The portion we received look like a Happy Hour special for $5. I wish the waitresses were more attentive because it took a while for me to get anyone's attention to pay the check.",Cobblestones Pub and Biergarten
554,Very good and large portions layered with shawarma. The price is very reasonable and the food is always hot off the order. Can't think of anything to say but to go more often!,Worker at the counter was rude as hell. Immediately attitude and rolling his eyes at what I had to say. It was like he hated me before he even met me. Walking away from me in mid sentence. Straight Ignoring what I had to say.Then this guy went so far as to fucking mimic me like a child when I asked him if the plate on the counter was my order.,"Got the burger and garlic Parmesan wings and I must say I am very disappointed.Burger was way too over cooked. The garlic Parmesan wings were basically just some normal wings with garlic and Parmesan sprinkled on top, I assumed it would be some sauce but it was not. Wings were all attached together too, and did not taste very well.Overall, not a good experience and I knew I should have gotten something else, waste of money.","I'm convinced this place catfishes reviews and pictures -there's no way this place could be doing so well. This place is absolutely disgusting! I've never had such a bad meal before in Astoria where you simply could not tolerate the meal at all. I ordered a mixed chicken kabab & beef / lamb shawarma platter to share with a friend. First, the delivery took nearly an hour and half (although the estimate says 30 mins). The food arrived cold and had a horrible smell. I had to throw it outside because it was reeking up my entire apartment! It smelled like bloody meat I kid you not. The chicken was dry beyond belief. I paid extra for tzatziki sauce and man, even that was bad. It was basically chobani plain yogurt with water pour on top (not even mixed, literally sitting on top all separated). Now the beef / lamb shawarma. We all think the rotating wheel of meat, all juicy with a slight char. Well, this place decided to call frozen flank slice beef a shawarma. I feel like this place has never made this before because the meat tasted old and bloody as if it was not finished thawing. I could gag thinking about it. I felt like forcing this meal out of my body because it made me feel sick all night. This place should not be business!See pictures if you don't believe me! Yuck! Run away!","When Shawarmania first opened a handful of years ago, they were going through some serious growing pains (slow delivery, customer service issues, food quality, etc.), so much so that I'd wonder if they'd make it. Fast forward to now: not only have them outgrown their issues, but they've become a big part of why Ditmars is thriving as a neighborhood.Food wise, they are bringing the heat. Portions are very good for the value and should satiate even the hungriest eater. From their pita sandwich combos to their very heavy platters, it is a win for all people who love any ounce of this kind of food.Their mixed grill platter might be the most expensive item ($17?) on the menu but it's got enough food for two people. The chunks of lamb, chicken, and beef are tender and delicious. Drizzled with tahini and a side of pita and I'm all set.But there is a lot more to appreciate. Their classic chicken kebab pita sandwich is the bomb in itself. The same goes for their infamous ""shawafel"" which is chicken shawarma with falafel all stuffed into a sandwich with vegetables and tahini + hummus. Pictures and descriptions certainly don't do it justice. For our less meat loving friends, their eggplant salad and chickpea salad is very tasty. The falafel is excellent and pairs well with everything on the menu.  I'm not super sold on the ""Arabic salad""which is a tad too heavy on the tomatoes and onions for me. For feta loving folks, their feta salad is a big hit and their sauces serve as outstanding condiments.I am looking forward to my next meal here already.","I've heard too many good things about this place to not give it a shot. You get a sh*tload of food at a decent price. I ordered two MEDIUM (not large...MEDIUM) chicken shawarma bowls and they could've fed four people easily.Delivery was on time. Don't expect decent presentation since all the sauces get a little messy in the to-go packaging, but the food is good, they don't skimp on the meat, and you get a lot of bang for your buck.",Shawarmania
555,"Considering all the other bukharian restaurants around here that serve the same exact food; AVOID this place!!! I came here during lunch time when they weren't busy. The fries came out grey!!! Obviously it's a sign that they fry them in cold oil. The meat was raw, not fully cooked. The manti were brought out cold. We told the staff and they did absolutely nothing to fix the problem. Our waitress took our shish Kebobs right off the table to ""throw it back on the grill"" Obviously the meat came out rough. I just don't understand how an establishment can serve food that doesn't meet its standards. To say the food was disgusting is an understatement. This place really fell off over the years and I will not be coming back.",Terrible experience. Been coming here for many years. Went here for lunch today. Food was RAW. Manti were cold. After complaining the waitress offered 15% off. I left the extra 15% to the waitress.,"I would give 4 stars for the food, but the service was awful.

PERFECT! highly recommended!!!!!!!!","Looks sketchy from the outside, but give it a try! It's very pretty inside with a decorated ceiling and white tablecloths on the tables. It's great for family meals. I came for lunch and it was pretty empty. Got the Israeli salad and the chicken salad to start. Both were pretty filling, especially the chicken one. If you don't want dressing, go with the Israeli. If you want a salad that could be a meal, go with the chicken. Also got the luleh kabob, which was so soft and juicy. It was so good I literally slurped it down. I could eat this all day, err' day. Their luleh is a must. All of that, plus their green tea, makes for a fantastic meal. The service was better than I'm used to at Russian/Uzbek restaurants. The waitress was on top of things, but just wish they told us what was what in terms of the skewers of meat, because my friend ended up eating mine, and I had to reorder my luleh! The prices are cheap, but careful, they will sneak up and add up on the bill. They do have lunch specials on the weekdays.",Taste food ! Large portions! Amazing kebabs !

556,"This place is definitely worth the hype. The soup dumplings were exactly as they should be, large, soupy, and flavorful. We ordered 2 orders (crab and pork) and not a single one of them was broken.",CHECK YOUR RECEIPT BEFORE YOU PAY. somehow 2 orders of pork soup dumplings ($6.75 each) and bok choy (off menu) turned out to be $36 with tip??????? I trusted them and didn't think much of it until after I calculated the prices sadly. Food was average and it was the first meal we had all day after having no food and landing in LGA at 2pm. They give red bean dessert at the end it's like a soupy sweet dessert which was nice but being charged $10? Extra is not.,"I've always gone to the Joe's Shanghai location in Chinatown, this was my first time in the flushing location, and I was a little underwhelmed. The soup dumplings were just OK. I was kind of craving them, but they really paled in comparison to soup dumplings I've eaten at Chinatown restaurants in general. Also the ambience and decor left a lot to be desired. Gave the chain a bit of a cheap feel. I would not return to this location.","The Xiao Loong Pao (steamed meat dumplings, a northern Chinese speciality) is a little larger than usual but the pocket of broth inside the dumplings are perfectly contained just for you.We tried the crab meat version, which made it even savory and naturally sweet.Will return.","I haven't had that many soup dumplings in my life, but I could honestly say that Joe's Shanghai was just okay. I've heard about Joe's Shanghai so many times and I was convinced that it would be great. We ordered the pork soup dumplings, which comes with 8. The dumpling skin was thicker than I expected. The soup and the pork itself tasted good, but there wasn't much. I'm disappointed in the hype. I'm sure there are other better places in Flushing.","It's the OG soup dumpling restaurant in NY, they were the first to make soup dumplings popular here. The Flushing location is the original Joe Shanghai location which opened in 1995. It's been years since my last visit but I am very happy they they have stayed consistent over the years. Also worth noting, I thought the service was great, our tea was constantly filled, the waiters were always asking if we needed anything and they even changed our plates for clean ones, I was really impressed with the service. The food:Pork Meat Soup Dumplings- Pork is my go to for soup dumplings and the ones here were great. The broth packed so much flavor and the skins didn't break from picking them up. I thought the soup dumplings were great. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Crab Meat with Pork Meat Soup Dumplings- There was actually an even split with three people at our table liking the pork more and three that liked the crab meat version better. For me, I thought the crab had a little bit of an unpleasant sea funk and I didn't the crab version added much.Scallion Pancake- Omg these were so good. They were fried perfectly without being oily or greasy. I liked how the outside was nice and crunchy yet the inside had a nice chew. Highly recommend the scallion pancakes. Eggplant with Garlic Sauce (with Pork)- These were Japanese eggplants cooked with a sweet and sour sauce with thin slices of pork, I thought this was my fav entree dish. I loved how tender the eggplant was and I really enjoyed the sauce, I also liked how there was a tiny bit of heat in this dish. Highly recommend. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Beef Fried Rice Cake- I enjoyed the chewiness of the rice cake and the beef and sauce were nice. Overall, a good dish but kinda on the simple side. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Sesame Chicken- The flavor of the sesame chicken was good but it was dryer than we had hoped. We also felt the chicken meat was a tad tough. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Shanghai Sautéed Flat Noodle. This was an OK dish, same as the above, the flavors were good but not an exciting dish. The noodles were kinda like a udon noodle but I thought the noodles were a bit too soft for me, it was borderline on the mushy side. This was just so so for me.",Joe's Shanghai
557,"Was here last night with some friends. Ordered the truffle mushroom burger medium well. Server forgot about the order and we had to remind him and he got the burger after waiting about half an hour. The burger was so dry I had to eat it with a glass of water. Not only the patty was dry, there was no truffle flavor or moisture at all in the burger. The mushrooms inside the burger were burnt to bits like black charcoal. They actually tasted burnt and bitter. My thing is, if you see you burnt the mushrooms to pure carbon, why would you still add that to a burger that's already devoid of any moisture content.Really wanted to like this place because of the outdoor seating and ambience but we won't be back.","3 days of Uncle Jacks Meat, no not that meat and not left overs either. It was decided that we have a company dinner with our out of town guests and unfortunately one of the guys picked a place that sounds more like a porn name. That should have been the first warning. We had a round of drinks and the appetizers were great, try the bacon with peanut butter. We placed our order 6 people, some sides...the works. A buddy got a filet, one got Kobe, blah blah and I got a tomahawk steak. Now when you order a steak at a steak house and with such a meaty name as Uncle Jacks, you'd assume one would be impressed. Not in this case.It was delivered underwhelming in size, presentation and with lots of char. There were a few edible pieces so I gave it a go and the taste was extremely odd and sour but chalked it up to maybe the seasoning and the char mixing. After a bit a coworker asked to try a piece and knowing that I said it tastes funky, he tried and tasted the sourness in the meat. Smh...the bummer is, this happened to two of the six steaks.  The manager was cool and removed the dinners from our $730 bill and tossed us a few drinks too. But here I am three days later with food poisoning and explosive...you get the idea.Sorry Jack, you only get two stars, one for the free drinks and the other for the comical name.","UPDATE:Went back when in the neighborhood and tables were open outside on a nice evening. It was early and NOT crowded. We ordered our drinks and our server just disappeared. A table of three guys came after us and same thing happened to them. Hello! Where the hell are you? I finally got up and went to the bar to get them myself. The manager observed everything unfolding. Finally, when we left without ordering any food, he came up and gave us gift cards to use in the future. I gave them to my daughter to use as she lives in the area. I have removed a star from the original rating and won't be back.","Planned a retirement lunch party for our awesome boss and from the moment we arrived all the way to the end of our meal, Melissa and all the staff were amazing!!  We were never rushed and Melissa came back often to see if we need more food or another round of drink. We had reservations for 2pm but some of us arrived a little earlier. Which was not a problem. We were seated right away and waited for the rest of the guest to show up. We had no idea that they were only serving the brunch menu at the moment and the kitchen would not serve the regular dinner menu until 4pm. However they allowed us to start ordering from the dinner menu an hour earlier. We took our time having drinks and mingling while enjoying some fresh bakes bread and biscuits which were amazing!!! After ordering our appetizers and main dishes which included (2 Flintstones) 120 Days aged steaks and (2)  Kobe steaks from Japan. The steaks were brought over to our the table pre-cooked with a brief explanation of the origins and the aging process. Overall everything was amazing!! From appetizers to entrees and sides all the way down to desserts.","I'm so confused with what to say. I went at the beginning of this month (August 2019) and I was so impressed! I haven't been that impressed by service, food, and the ambiance in so long! My waiter Kevin was amazing and even brought out a cake to celebrate my birthday cause he over heard us speaking about it! Everything was delicious! We ordered the mozzarella wedges, corngasm brûlée and a Cuban sandwich. No complaints AT ALL with anything! We loved it so much we took my parents out to eat today there cause we were so impressed with the place. We ordered the plates to share and per usual, it was amazing! Mac and cheese, corngasm brûlée, and asparagus! Two people ordered the Cuban sandwich, one ordered the steak over pasta, and another ordered the chicken biscuit sandwich. Right away, we knew something was wrong. The Cuban sandwich, was not pressed and was like a hero type of bread, def. wasn't like that before. We open it up, and there's no pickles, just cucumbers. We asked if we can get some pickles on the side and they said they don't carry those, only cucumbers. A CUBANO NEEDS PICKLES! That's what makes it a CUBANO! If not then it's a pork and cucumber hero! Then the steak over pasta was drowning in salt, it was inedible. Thankfully, the waitress was really nice and brought it back for us and they took it off the bill and gave us a free cup of wine. The chicken sandwich was okay but my mashed potatoes were 100%... without a doubt...boxed mashed potato with no flavor! If I'm coming to a meat house where they charge a ton for their food, I'm not expecting boxed masked potatoes. Especially since I came a few weeks ago and the mash was to die for! Buttery and garlicy! Even my sister across the table said ""your mashed potatoes look really dry"" Overall, I'm just shocked and wondering what could have happened in just a few weeks! I heard they got new management recently so idk if that's what it is but it was disappointing and everyone was unhappy with the food when I wanted to take my parents out for a nice dinner and came out to be the opposite.","It's interesting to me the people bringing businesses to our neighborhood; they don't understand who we are. We're mostly working class couples and families and we need good food cheap (18 bucks for a hamburger? c'mon, srsly? or am I just writing from the past ...). Plus, the portions? I wish them well, but it's not for us. We got delivery last night and this will be our last time. Bless you if you like it, bless you if you don't find this on the prohibitively expensive side, bless them in their dream of bringing this food to Ditmars, but here's my two cents:1/4 I can't believe how QUICKLY they delivered our food, it was amazing. Well, it should be for a TWO DOLLAR DELIVERY charge. (are you kidding me?)2/4 That was THEE best ""(5 Cheese) Mac and Cheese"" we've had in years. Even thought the portion is small (eight dollars for about a half-cup) it's worth every penny, it's creamy with a crispy top, flavourful, bold and full bouquet of cheeses.3/4 (a) WHY would they put some sweet yucky sauce on Shredded Crispy Brussels Sprouts with bacon, it was awful (to me, ""pretty good"" to my husband) and (b) WHY does that HANDFUL of vegetables cost 8$. That price-point was offensive.4/4 I knew going in this place is pricey, but on a Summer Sale other places in the hood have at least 6 ribs in a ""rack"" for 18 bucks so at 14$ for of Smoked Local Pork Spare Ribs order, I was not surprised there were only 4 ribs, they were but c'mon ... it's a neighborhood joint, you want me to come back frequently? 14 bucks for four ribs and a spoonful of horrible slaw is not gonna encourage me.We won't be going back, we'll be going out of our way to Butcher Bar at 30th Avenue or we used to go Bubba's on Ditmars but the reviews lately are bad (and their sides aren't really great and their chicken is awful). Peace, I wish this place well, but they're going to have to succeed without us.",Uncle Jack's Meat House
558,"This place is always crowded when I visit and the food is hit or miss. The mushroom burger has too much cheese in it in my opinion, but I do like the fact that the portions aren't too big so it's filling.The only negative is that the price for the burgers are too pricey. I can get a bigger burger at Cheeburger for the same price of a full meal combo.","I almost walked pass by this Shake Shack and had to peer in the window to find it. It was a Sunday and there was a street fair and so many pedestrians outside. As you walk in there is a line with one register, there are kiosk where you can place your order. Sorry folks, wee bit tech challenged and prefer to go to a register and place an order with someone. It was a bit backed up with one person in front of us that had questions. Staff ask us to use Kiosk. I had no idea and just waited which did not took too long.Once order placed, receipt and pager given to you like other Shake Shacks. Towards the back was the dining area and where the restrooms  were located. Noticed stairs- more tables and chairs? It was a grab and go type day. My friend had a plane to catch. Did not have time to walk all over the place and check out all the facilities.This place reminds me of a fast food joint like a McDonalds.Guess, I was spoiled by going to the Shake Shake out in Westbury, Long Island. Now, that was a fun place. Whole different vibe.The burgers are universally the same and the crinkle fries. Haven't tried the shakes here but most everyone was getting shakes for the kids on a hot day.","Thanks to out-of-state travels, I got to debut 3 different fast-casual burger chains all in 1 month: Smashburger and In-N-Out Burger in Vegas and Shake Shack here in New York. While In-N-Out seemed to enjoyed the most hype in the media, partly due to its operating vicinity in Western US and thus Hollywood, the New York based Shake Shack appeared to be the hottest burger joint in the Northeast. Though not an aficionado of burgers, I could readily tell the difference in quality of a Shack Burger, but not its Western rivals.  I enjoy the texture of the beef, the buttery buns, and whatever ingredients they put in its secret sauce. Even the tomato seemed fresher and the lettuce greener. Now why only 4 stars? There were only 1 line with cashier, and 4 touch-kiosks with no taker.  I decided to wait in line since there were only 2 people in front of me --  and in case I had questions since it was my first time at any ShakeShack.  I was quickly the next in line; however, there was a problem with the receipt or calculating the correct changes for the previous order, and I was stuck waiting for the next 10 minutes!  I was really frustrated. Since the closest touch-kiosk was within an arm's length away, I tried to sneak an order without losing my place in line. Unfortunately, when I was all ready to check out and pay, the screen flashed an error message - something about white list and out of range! After the cashier finally put in my order, I dreaded the next round of waiting upon joining the horde waiting to receive their orders. Luckily, I didn't have to wait too long -- either that, or my expectation was way too low after the infuriating ordering process.  Oh, another miss: there was only 1 ketchup pump and it was out of ketchup!So the quality of the burgers was able to make up the very negative experience and poor operation.  That speaks volume about how much we loved the ShackBurgers!","The man who cleans up here is really on point! Took our plates away after we finished and opened the door for us on the way out. The ordering kiosks r convenient and there is seating on the second floor. My party of four found a seat immediately near the window on a weekday for dinner. Now the real reason why I am writing this review...THEY HAVE BLACK SESAME SHAKES YALL!!!I saw the ad on their big screen and being the easily influenced eater i am i had to order a large (good enough to split bt three full people). Really legit, tastes like my favorite black sesame frappe at japanese Cafe Zaiya in the city- if anything this ones a little heavier. So yummy","My go-to from Shake Shack was always the Chick'n Shack, I recently cut out meat from my diet and I thought to myself, what could I possibly order from Shake Shack now?! I decided to try something new off the menu and, the Shroom burger caught my eye. It's unfortunately the only vegetarian option :( The shroom burger consists of crisp fried portobello mushroom filled with munster and cheddar cheese. I ordered fries to accompany the burger, of course. When I took my first bite, I was surprised at how cheesy it was! I've grown extremely fond of mustard lately and added it to my burger and I loved it. Now that I know I won't have to permanently quit eating from Shake Shack, I'm ecstatic! I hope later on in the future Shake Shack makes vegan options, since the Shroom burger does contain cheese! I even suggested my friends to try the shroom burger as an alternative. Can't wait to come back and eat here again!","My friend was yearning to try the Chick'n Shack, and how could I exactly deny her? I've been obsessed with Shake Shack for quite some time, there was one across the street from my previous job. I always have my favorite order: cheese fries (I love when they're well done) strawberry shake, and that mouth-watering chick'n shack with mustard and ketchup.. (I'm drooling all over again)Me and my friend decided to dine in and she ordered the same exact thing as me, only a vanilla shake. As hectic and busy Shake Shack can get, I love how swift the service was. I must say it exceeded all expectations my friend had. She loved it so much, she was sad she only ordered one sandwich and even blurred out she loved it more then Chick-Fila's chicken sandwich! We will definitely be coming back. Thank you for an amazing meal and wonderful service as always!",Shake Shack
559,We had not come back to this location because we had previous bad experiences.  However my husband was hungry and was in the mood for Olive Garden salad.  We had s pleasant dinner.  Our server was nice.  Olive garden is not the best food but it will do for a quick Thursday night dinner.,"I had a craving and I saw the commercial last night and once again disappointed as usual. The lasagna was much smaller than advertised, not enough sauce, not enough ricotta, and not enough cheese. Even the salad didn't taste as good as it used to. I was planning on getting an entrée to go for $5 promo but I didn't even bother at the end because it would be a waste of stomach space. The Piadina was so under-stuffed that it looked like a quesadilla.","i been going to this location for over 10 years because my wife loves the food. we always had good time there. i always gave them good reviews as well. but the reason behind today's bad review is what they did to me 2 days ago on october 1st, 2019. my wife had an dentist appointment right next to this location. she asked me to  bring her lunch from olive garden & pick her up after. so i went, parked my car parking lot behind it, brought take out, left the receipt on the dashboard & went to pick my wife up. dentist office took little longer then expected. when i came back to pick up my car, it wasn't there. they towed my car even when their receipt was on display. it may cost me $272 but they lost some loyal veteran customers.","This olive garden restaurant is one of my favorite. Olive gardens,I have been coming to this particular location for years. Every since this spot was built over there .this restaurant give you a decent environment feel.but it is still casual at the same time .I love Italian food and when ever me and my family are at queens center mall shopping this is one of our favorite pastime to stop by olive garden .the staff is always upbeat and courteous, and the atmosphere is always peaceful just the right kind of place to dine in .a lot of couples and families alike. The food is pretty good over there.You get that great olive garden taste no matter where the location is.from there garlic rolls and mozzarella sticks!! Cant forget about there garden salads. Some great appetizers.also the prices aren't to bad for a good meal.Now for the meal I like to order something with chicken. I like there chicken alfredo parmesan with a lot of pepper on it .also with the spaghetti and meat sauce. and there cocktail options weren't bad at all.the staff is always upbeat and polite. We like there energy over there I would definitely go back there in the future.","I don't go to chain restaurants often but I was craving pasta and olive gardens breadsticks. The breadsticks were amazing! Buttery, soft and warm. I had the fettuccine alfredo and was a bit let down. I remembered it as being so creamy and tasty but it didnt live up this time. The other people in my party got the creamy mushroom ravioli and pasta with pesto sauce and shrimp which they said was good. The service was fine not above and beyond. The bathroom was disgustingly dirty. Toilet paper and paper towels all over the floor, garbage overflowing, poop stains on the toilet seats and nothing to dry hands. I complained and they clean it... to an extent. At the end when I was leaving, I asked the hostess for the Andes chocolates. He at first ignored me and then when I didnt move, he said not at the moment and then turned and walked away. Rude.Good for big groups. I probably wont be coming back though.","Great pasta or salad, the bread is also delicious. If you want to have a cheatmeal or not healthy food this is a great option, plates are caloric but delicious. They also have some desserts. Overall is a good experience.",Olive Garden Italian Restaurant
560,I've tried so many places and nothing ever tops it. It might be the fresh selection of sauces idk but it's always fire.,"Japanese style hotpot ShaBu ShaBu is not provided here but it does have no drill options. They charge for sauces, but you can order combo options that includes soup, beef, seafood, or a veggie platter","I love it here; my brother in law arranges meets with me and my bio brother; and we have a ball yelling ""Fuk You, Okay??"" The whole way there, the whole time there, and on the way out.The Food! Ingredients are fresh never spoiled! The Smells are Hardcore Shabu hot pot . If you cant stand exotic smells; better not go. And you better know what you're doing: White people: first few times go with someone who knows how to season a broth, or don't go at all you'll end up with a bland broth; or way too spicy and hate it and kill this place on Yelp for no reason other then your own Stupidity. I hate those people; they go to a farm and get pissy on Yelp they ran out of eggs. Yelp lets every Bitchy whiny customer ruin a rating. If that's you, Fuk u, ok??","Love this place.  Its can get crowded, but we always seem to get a table.There is a good selection of vegetables and meat.  Some of the cooked side dishes are wonderfully delicious.  I enjoy a nice large Mango Slush each time we go.  This place beats the crowds we always see on Main Street Flushing.","Japanese style hotpot ShaBu ShaBu is not provided here but it does have no frill options. There's two ways to order here: one is to do everything a la carts by the item or combo options that includes soup, beef, seafood, or a veggie platter. Sauces are charged extra when you do the first option. The dumplings are made fresh so enjoy","This place is open late, close to home, has backyard parking garage, and is clean.When you feel like going out for late night dining, and the weather is gloomy this is a great spot to pop into. The hotpot swirls perfect food, their condiment station is always filled while the steam fogs up the glass doors giving this place a warm cozy homey vibe. These guys have been around a long time, my father used to like coming here all the time. The staff here is friendly and frequently fill your pots with more soup. The owners are a Taiwanese couple and they always make stuff for him off the menu. Plus they have a great drink menu.Freshness in their food, portions are just right, pricing is fair, multiple broth options, meat and seafood selections are plenty...can't go wrong.",Fukuoka Shabu Shabu
561,"I think I liked the ramen broth - tasty, not too rich, and much less saltier than broth at other shops. The ramen noodles were not to my liking but the chasyu pork inside the ramen and appetizers were really good. Might be coming back eventually but want to check out Mu nearby before I return here. The waitstaff were very polite and attentive but also made a few errors throughout the evening.","I came here late night for pork slice ramen. They gave me three slices of pork, typical. The broth was tasty and well done. Didn't disappoint. Definitely a good place to come for late night ramen noodles.","Pretty average ramen place. Takoyaki was good but they only gave you 4 pieces as opposed to the usual six. Ramen was alright, decent broth but not spicy even though I got the spicy miso ramen. Noodles were not that great, seemed a bit over cooked. Chasu was okay too, nothing amazing. If I'm in the area and needed some lunch then maybe I would come again but there are other ramen places in the area that I'd probably give another try first.","Honestly, whenever my dad and I too lazy to make dinner, we automatically get ramen from this place. I've been here more than a handful of times, and it's consistently great ramen. I get the Kara miso and my dad gets the champon ramen. Everyone that works there are always really nice and even though it s a tiny location, it love the environment and energy the place gives off!",No complaints here. I had the shoyo ramen and definitely enjoyed it. Soup had the perfect balance of flavor where it wasn't too salty like some places. Served with the right portions for the folks that don't want to overeat but also enough to leave satisfied. Cheers and enjoy some ramen here.,Ordered a bowl of ramen. The broth was pretty flavorful. Pork loin was well executed. Noodles were chewy and springy.,Tamashii Blue
562,"FIVE FUGGEN STARS!You get a lot of food for you heard earned American dollar at this place, and Tina? The waitress? Fuggedaboutit. She's the best. No choochy hippie food here, just rock solid BBQ - it's messy, but it should be messy. Word around town has it that the BBQ might be shutting down soon. That would be a sad, sad day in Jackson Heights should that come to be the case. We need a watering hole with good quality comfort food in the neighborhood and Legends gives you just that.Also, sometimes random drunk ladies at the bar will come over and buy you rounds.",I just heard the kitchen is closing . the building owner finally has a good guy running the kitchen and he's kicking them out. I'll never come in here again. The bar is horrible. Watered down booze. The owner of the kitchen posted on Facebook a picture of one of the bar owners mixing cheap alcohol into a high end bottle of alcohol. Horrible. No wonder I'm sick after I drink in here.,Got the pulled pork sandwich.  All FAT!   Worst sandwich we have EVER had. Service is horrible!   Bar and food tab is separate which is totally crazy.  You can not combine even if you are paying by credit card.  Two separate transactions.  One of the people in our party only has a beer and could not put it on a credit card.    Terrible experience all around!,"Last night, got the meats platter which included pulled pork, ribs, brisket, bbq chicken, and kielbasa. Also included were onion rings. All of the meats were tender, smokey and delicious and the onion rings there are some of the best we've had.BBQ in the back of Legends (the bar and the bbq are often run separately) has a long history. To be fair, its current incarnation is not the best it's been (Ranger for those of you who were there a looong time ago was THE best... RIP), but the current owners seem to be working hard to improve and, every time we go there, it's definitely evident. They are friendly and very open to feedback.Hope it stays for a long time as it's a change from the usual in the neighborhood. While I'm a fan of plenty of different ethnic foods, sometimes it's nice to eat some good ol' American BBQ. Looking forward to the next time we go!","A little backstory...Legends has changed many times over the past ten years. When my husband and I started going there the food was fantastic and we were diehard fans and we'd be there 2-3 times a month. It changed owners and the food was still very good (even if different) but the place didn't have the same ""hang out for hours"" appeal. Those owners left and the bar itself took over the back barbecue area and were making mostly bar food and some odd (but perhaps delicious, don't know) cuisine choices. Legends has a legendary smoker and it was killing us that they weren't using it. A week or two ago my husband noticed a sign outside that they had the smoker going again so we decided to go last night.A breakdown of our order...1 lb. brisket - the flavor was good and it was fatty and tender like it should be. It was very thin cut though and I am of the opinion that brisket is best when it's thicker. Not much of a smokey flavor and seemed to me more like roast beef than brisket.1 lb. pulled pork - I was not a fan. My husband and our friend liked it. It was cooked well and tender and juicy but lacked smokiness as well and somehow seemed watery.Note - the barbecue sauce was pretty blah. Store bought, completely generic. Pretty disappointing.Buffalo wings - FANTASTIC. I thought to myself as I was eating them that they might be some of the best I've had. And my husband and I like our buffalo wings. Very moist and saucy. I would go back just for the wings.Chips and guacamole - not sure if the guacamole was freshly made as I'm not an expert on guacamole. The color seemed a little less green than just-made guacamole would be but there was a lot of onion and cilantro which I love. The chips were not fresh, but I wouldn't expect them to be. They were fine for what they were even though I, personally, prefer thinner crispier chips.Spinach (side) - It was fine, not worth ordering again. Nothing wrong with it though.Onion rings - Really, really good. Big and freshly fried tasting. Real onion inside (I never understand onion rings that don't have an actual onion strip inside). Like the buffalo wings, also worth going back for. We will return, I'm sure. We like the bar and the people who own it and even though we haven't been there in over a year, one of the bartenders came over to us to ask about our meal and offered us a round of free drinks. The waitress, who must be newish, was also perfectly nice. I hope they stick to the good stuff and improve on the BBQ. We'd love this to be our regular hangout again.","Used to go here many many years ago (at LEAST 13 years ago) and haven't had the chance to come back since. My friend recommended this place to meet up and once I saw it, it brought me back so many memories of BBQ goodness. The bar area up front has good vibes and a few TVs. Not super packed but always busy. Friendly customers that will engage with anyone so you feel like you're a part of a ""bar family."" My friend comes here more often and I believe the bartender's name was Ziggy. You never have to wait long to be served a drink. I went to the back to order some ""To Go"" to bring back home to my brother (who now lives in another state) and would enjoy it if I brought it to him as a surprise. The lady in the back explained that the management has changed a few times since I've last been there but basically now they're serving the original recipes from back in the day. I didn't know what to order so I ended up getting a platter (half a pound of basically everything - brisket, pulled pork, ribs, kielbasa, half a chicken) and comes with a side (I picked potato salad).Favorites: kielbasa, ribs, brisket, and potato salad.The ""To Go"" order smelled so good that I ended up ordering a brisket meal (side of fries) while I was there even though I just came from dinner. To be honest, the brisket that I had while I was there was kind of dry and underwhelming and I started to question whether or not I should have ordered the ""To Go"" without trying it first. But when I brought it to my brother's house to reheat, it tasted so much better. Not sure why but it didn't disappoint.",Legends Bar & Grill
563,"Food was great but I felt racism from the white staff. when I entered the restaurant with my boyfriend, the girl saw us and suddenly turned around the table and went back to the kitchen. She should be fired ! I am writing this review for my bad experience ever. It can't be possibly happened in New York. Anyhow food was excellent.",UNORGANIZED AND UNFRIENDLY!I just about had enuff of this had been place !I have been coming here my whole life and lately the attitude in this place is just simply a TURNOFFThe incompetent young girl at the counter should not be working there ... After patiently waiting an hour ... and finally sitting down she tells me I can't order sauce w my veal Marsala because the whole table had to have the same type of pasta . It was me and another person I have never been told that in my life by them or anyone anywhereIt's annoying to pay good money for a Sunday dinner have to negotiate if they can do 2 separate types of pasta for 2 separate ordersEarlier she also caused confusion w the sitting or waiting at the bar song and dance When the waiter clearly had it under  control Whatever if the owners don't care to lose a customer of 20 years then there are tons of great or better places than this has been spotNever see the owners here lately ... that's probably a sign they could care less for there service . Wondering what's next the quality of the food ??????Smh wasted my time here,"This place is truly just the worst so called ""Italian"" food I have ever eaten. The food is tasteless, soggy, greasy and sauces are just bland and overly creamy and u can tell they use cheapest ingredients money can buy, very overpriced place. Please do not believe the absolutely phony good reviews, they are lies. Dont believe me, go see for yourself. You will regret it. I've lived in the area for 45 yrs, I know every restaurant,eatery, store, deli, etc in the entire area. I know more about them all than I can say here. This place, no. If you only knew. Cheap cheap crap expired ingredients. They don't throw anything away, they actually recycle food. Ok nuff said.",This is my favorite restaurant in Ridgewood. It's always so good!

The staff is very kind and welcoming. Highly recommended. 5-stars,A really great local Italian spot with a very modest menu.

We had to walk to them to get their attention. They charged for the ""complimentary"" chips that were given on the table when we sat down.They charged when we asked them to  wrap up the leftovers. If these are their policy, ok, but they should clearly let the customers know.Food was ok, but not worth the price. Not going back and will not recommend.","If I'm ever in the mood for some delicious rotisserie chicken, my go-to spot is Super Pollo! I typically order delivery through Seamless and the food always hot and ready to eat. Also, the food is packaged very nicely to avoid any spills during the delivery, which is much appreciated.My go-to order (for 2 as I usually order with my girlfriend) is the 1/4 chicken with yellow rice and beans with empanadas on the side and the soup of the day, which is usually chicken soup. The flavor of everything is savory and very well-seasoned. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to try something new as I'm sure they won't disappoint!","I've only ordered delivery here but when I do, it's always comes within the hour and is pretty warm. If it's not hot even I just pop it in the microwave for a few, no biggie. My go-to order is as the Bandeja Paisa for $17. It is soo much good and delicious. I really don't know what that means in English but it includes: Rice and beans, plantains, pork skin, egg, avocado and a nice big piece of beef. If you eat the whole thing you will definitely want to avoid heavy machinery or take a nap. You can always share if you want to, it's that big.","Amazing food. This was my go-to spot in Ridgewood.

Nothing is hot even though the delivery got here in probably 20 mins. The chicken wings are nasty and old and has weird dark spots and sooooo dry and disgusting. The stramboli is totally cold and nasty. The cheese isn't melted AT ALL. It's the middle of winter and the celery sticks they sent are warm and inedible. Like, what kind of quality is this?!? How does this place have such good reviews?? GrubHub called the restaurant and the owner refused to refund me for the bad food. So here you go owner of this nasty rip off establishment.

Burgers and sandwiches are prepared lazily, with cheap ingredients. They use Cheese Whiz straight out of the jar in their loaded fries. You'd think a place like this would value quality, especially with so many competitors in the immediate area. Additional, the cocktails are mediocre and overpriced for the small amount of liquor they contain. The indoor aesthetic photographs well, especially that huge neon QUEENS sign, but feels cold and uncomfortable once you're there in person.","Not a fan at all.  Came in hungry, took forever for the waitress to get back to me so instead I had drinks. Bad idea.I find lipstick on my glass,  instantly puked in my mouth. I asked for my drink to be remade and she comes back hands me my drink BAM.""That's a bar for you"" ? That's not pleasing to hear when getting my glass back after finding lipstick.  Won't be back again. Total hygiene issues here",I reached out to Derrek to hold a table for 20 for a birthday brunch. He was very responsive and accommodating in setting this up. Our server Vinnie worked expeditiously to get everyone's order/food right and also was generous enough to have separate checks allocated. The drinks were rolling out in perfect time and the food came out with a small but expected wait. Derrek warned us about the possible wait in food prep before hand for a big group. So that was completely ok. Derrek came out and checked on us often and Vinnie was literally a superhero with his service. I had the breakfast sandwich which comes on a pretzel bun with potatoes. Good meal along with the Mimosa Flights and a Mezcal Margarita which was done right. Great service.  We will be back and loved giving you our business.,"So I walked in to the place because I do like their coffee and this time around I wanted to order something to eat.The kitchen was supposedly closed over the summer so they offered me a egg and cheese sandwich instead. Which was made in the kitchen so I am a little confused.I took a couple of bites and I knew something wasn't quite right but after working out I was so hungry so I finished 75% of the sandwich.It's been a couple of hours ago since I was there and I have been throwing up like crazy for the past 30min.. this was the only thing I've ate today and I am sure that I got food poisoning.As I mentioned, I do like their coffee but I will never return again. I am scared to know how that sandwich was made and how that kitchen is looking.","I was looking for a place that has good bourbon cocktails and i found this thru the search. They also have a decent menu for a variety of choices.  When i walked in, the place was starting to get crowded and had great selection of music playing with a dark atmosphere which i prefer. There was 2 high top tables avail in the bar area she sat down after offering a choice. The place seemed busy in the main dining room. It just so happened the NCAA tournament was on both TV's at the bar so i could watch both games simultaneously.  The waitress was very friendly and quick to serve. We ordered 2 different  bourbon based cocktails and both hit the spot! We also ordered shishito peppers, kale salad and fish tacos. The fish may have been slightly over done for me but still quite tasty.  Ordered a second round of different bourbon based cocktails and again it hit the spot. There happened to be a birthday parry with about 20 people in the bar area, which is quite large, and they kept the mood very upbeat and the place can be a little loud, but appropriate and nice to spend. Its a place i can see myself returning for those bourbon cocktails!!",Sekend Sun
568,"Extreme Belly pain and heavy diarrhea next day .I visited twice , I can be sure now . This restaurant is one of the latest night spot in the area .First time I ordered seafood combo, beef tongue and thin beef(forget what part), with regular side, and I asked for pepper garlic ,they gave me picked pepper and garlic and normal green pepper and garlic . Everything is well cooked .(even overdone)The garlic and pepper were normal spicy .I had this meal at around 4am,Next day noon I woke up in the sleep with extreme belly pain..... it last about few hours ,and getting better after diarrhea .But I thought I ate something wrong ,maybe the seafood ect. , bc I never had this with korean bbq before.Well ,after about few days later, I was looking for late night meal again .I came to this restaurant again,avoided seafood combo. I ordered beef short rib , pork jowl , came with regular side , and ask for pepper and garlic . They gave me picked one and normal one again.It's good with meat.I felt fine first after meal, and six hours later , Belly pain , diarrhea ,came again,even the pain level is similar ,emmmmm. I ate nothing beside water after last meal,so I'm 100% is something wrong with this spot.And in my guess ,suspect 1 is the pickled pepper and garlic ,i have been to most of korean bbq in this area,most of them provide pepper and garlic ,only few of them are picked. And no everyone will ask for them .Just my guesses .","I came here with a group of my friends. We ordered seafood pancake, variety of seafood to grill, and some meat. The food wasn't good enough for me to come back. The only fresh seafood were the clams . The mussel and scallops were frozen. I didn't really care for the sauce they used on the mussels and scallops.  The bbq meat tasted better than the grilled seafood. Service was so so. We had to call the server over several times .","It is not even worth of one star. I am not a person really picky about food or services. In terms of quality and service here everything was really disappointed. No side dishes like even Kimchi were offered to us. I just saw other yelp reviewers' photos. Kimchi and steamed egg are complimentary side dishes apparently. The server was too busy to chat with each other. I know the fact the none of the food that we ordered to cook in kitchen. Our last order came 20 mins later. The server just dumped intestines in our bbq pan and left. I ended up grilling it by myself. They literally saw i was grilling the intestines. No one came to our table, just talking, talking, and talking to each other. This place is just awful. And!!!! They charge us credit/debit card fee($4) now!!  They didn't charge that kind of fee last time I visited. DO NOT EVER GO!",love the atmosphere. the seafood selection was bomb. everything was fresh and flavorful. my faves were the clams and crab legs. it'show this place stays open til 6am.,Love love love this place. Perfect for a casual night out over delicious korean food and soju. The workers are very welcoming and I always have a great time when I'm there. Food is fairly cheap considering that the portions are pretty big.,"Authentic as in it looks like something you would see in Korea with the low ceilings, round table with the gas stove for the bbqing, and advertisements for soju. To start off, they brought the sauces with the sesame oil and salt. Side dishes came in the stone rice bowls. One was a steamed egg and another was a soup. Both satisfied cravings until the main course came through cause when it's late at night...the least thing u wanna do is wait for food. Once the main entrees came, I couldn't wait to eat. Very fresh meat and they cook everything for u. We ordered a bunch of different meats and a spicy dish. Cuts of meat were absolutely amazing, not ur typical samgypsal, this is the thick, meaty and bite size version. Also we got the budae jigae with the spam, cheese, ramen noodles and hot dogs. Can't beat all those meats in one pot of spicy goodness. The staff comes over and cuts up and flips the bbq meat. Many places let u do it urself but at times when I'm super lazy, it's nice to not have to man the grill. Goo goong tang is open till MAD late for all the late night munchers.",Goo Gong Tan
569,"yesyesyes - I've been here three times and it's been fine and consistent for the occasions.Cute, intimate spot for light bites - meaning if you're ravenous you should sample lots or plan for round two at BCD. Food here is for a dainty, feminine palate.  Ample meat-on-stick options to try at fair low risk buy-in. I always opt for 'funkier' here: heart tissue, liver, cartilage, tongue. The Nori Tofu is a block of silken tofu with avo and seaweed - the seaweed paste (laced with wasabi) makes it worth it. Charred Mushrooms and Grilled Romaine to get the veggies in, but nothing to write home about. Ramen felt and tasted like an afterthought, but was also ordered as an afterthought...",NONONO:  What we order:1. Yakitori Don2. Vegetable Green Curry3. Uni Avocado  4. Yuzu Sorbet 5. Kuro Goma(Black sesame panna cotta and ice cream) Highly recommend the yuzu sorbet and kuro goma!,"I can tell this is a Korean owned Japanese restaurant, have been here a couple times, price is lower than most of the authentic Japanese restaurants. This could be a regular spot for good quality Japanese food in town for once a month. 2 people for about 60 bucks, good location, can't complaint more. I love their gyoza wings and toriyaki. Tips, make reservations before you come, otherwise the average waiting time for weekend is about 45mins for a 2 people table.",So happy we discovered this place! I've now been to nonono 3 times since opening and am so grateful for such a yummy restaurant near Penn Station / MSG. The variety of options is great and there is something for everyone. Some of our favorites include:- Nasu dengaku: deep fried eggplant with miso- Zuke maguro: marinated tuna sashimi with jalapeno sauce- Scallop and uni carpaccio- Beef tongue stew- Hamakama nikomi: simmered yellowtail collar with miso broth- Kinoko: Assorted charred mushrooms- Duck ankake: grilled duck over fermented miso scallion,"Worst service attitude ever.... the host has a look, tone of owing her money... the food isn't bad, but honestly there are countless good restaurants in NYC, so service is extra important... no one wants to have to encounter a host that has no smile and such a bad attitude The food is just okay as well - regular Japanese yakitoris among other dishes. But they do have a big menu with lots of options","My friends and I came here for dinner on a Sunday evening at 5:30. We had a reservation but we had to wait outside where a line was forming to get in since the restaurant wasn't opened yet.  When we got seated, we looked at the menu and I was a bit overwhelmed because there was so much food to choose from! We ended up ordering a bunch of skewers/Yakitori to share like the chicken wing, steak with shishito peppers, and tofu. We also got the stuffed mushroom (with pesto and scallops I think) and the mackerel. There was also a $9 sashimi special we got that was very good (I believe it included tuna, scallop, and some sort of fish). Everything we ordered was delicious. The portions were small so we had enough room in our stomachs a for our own entrees. I had the tori tantan ramen which I requested to be a little bit spicy but when I took the initial few bites, my mouth was on fire. After that, I got used to it and enjoyed it very much. Broth was creamy and almost peanut butter-like and the ground pork was perfect.Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. The prices were reasonable. I would definitely come here again if I'm in the area.",nonono
570,"This is the 2nd restaurant we ate at when we moved into Queens. We've been back, off, & on. Generally, everything we've ordered is good. We usually get the steak, & the chicken. Their steak isn't the best cut, but they slice it thin, to make it decent; we have no complaints, but a steak snob would not like some of their steak dishes (Bistec A Lo Pobre, & Bistec Encebollado). The chicken is well seasoned, & always on point. The place is small, service is nice, & it's right near the subway station. *recommend: 1/2 chicken entree","The Ceviche and the Pescado a lo Macho, were delicious like always,Great friendly service as always,Too bad, I had the most annoying, loud talking no manners, people next to me...But hey is not Don Alex fault...","Ordered the lunch special of a small chicken soup, small salad, and mixed beef and chicken fried rice which also has hot dogs pieces(arroz chaufa) over the phone.  Order was ready when I walked in. When I walked in the girls were nice but one seemed confused where the orders went. It was packed. The place itself is really small. When I got to the office to eat I was disappointed. A bit pricey for the small amount of food served. Other things to consider: Parking is horrible. They have 1 hr meters right in front.  Taste of the rice was ok.","I came here on a Sunday evening with my bff and my kids. The place is small and intimate. As soon as we walked in, there were other people leaving, the waitress cleaned up their area and seated us there immediately. The waitress was very nice and patient with my kids. I ordered a pitcher of sangria & ceviche de pescado with tostones. My bff ordered 1/4 chicken with yellow rice and salad. The ceviche was perfection!!!! The flavor, consistency and overall spice was fantastic! I dipped my tostones in the lime/chili juice. The sangria was also great. It definitely gave me the effect I craved that particular night.The restaurant was not one of the usual places I would go to eat dinner, but I'm glad I did try it.","After a dining here a few times, this is easily one of my to-go spots for "" Spanish "" cuisine. Small but can get really busy, and staff are always welcoming. Food come in big portions, making the price point tolerable. Some days it can be a miss but most times this place dishes out deliciousness.Reccomend!","Best overall Peruvian in Forest Hills / Rego Park area. There are many to choose from these days. Each one is strong in one area: chicken, ceviche, the aji... but Don Alex is good all around. Certainly the best most authentic and tasty ceviche. Great anticuchos. Nothing is bad. Good delivery service. Next time please separate the cold food from the hot food in the delivery bag. Maybe two separate bags. Pretty easy solution.",Don Alex
571,I just ordered a Greek salad. Portion was so small for the price . I paid $9.50. Rip off. I would go to gyro world instead who gives you bigger portion for same price. Their individual salad is more of a side salad than an actual entree salad.,I just ordered from here off Uber eats . My chicken Kalamaki platter was okay and so were the kolokithokeftedes . The major reason why I put one star is because while I was eating my lemon soup I noticed this black dot which seemed odd bc there wasn't any other sort of pepper/dark spice in the soup . When I looked closer I realized it was a dead fly . Very disgusting .  I had just opened the very well packaged soup so it was in there since it left the restaurant.I'm angry because it was pricey which I have no problem with but if you pay more you expect better food conditions and certainly not a dead bug in the food you paid for . Really disappointing .,I've ordered from here a handful of times and got their grill platter for 2 which nicely feeds 4. Kebabs and chicken are nicely seasoned and served with rice and pita. Not as greasy as Fontana's and moderately priced.,"It is awesome place for meat lover.Price is reasonable and the portion is very generous.I have been to many Greek restaurants and this is absolutely one of the best place I have been to.The food is delicious and most importantly, the wait staffs are nice.Specially Ruth was very humble, kind, and resourceful about the food.","The pork and the pita bread were the absolute best parts; the pork was flavorful and cooked just perfectly (not dry). The salad was ok, I didn't enjoy the dressing as much. Will definitely come back","Lamb and beef gyro is the way to go. Juicy and tender meat with the tzatziki sauce is my preferred way. But if you are having some pita on its own, the tirokafteri is the only way to enjoy pita. Also the fried calamari was delicious. Large pieces of calamari and very tender considering the size. Of course the Greek Salad did not disappoint. It compliments the gyro perfectly.",Kalamaki GR
572,"Spent $30 on a delivery order for a chicken pita sandwich, tabouleh salad, and baklava.They messed up the order and packed an israeli salad instead of a tabouleh salad.  Food was mediocre.  Ingredients were not fresh.  Israeli salad is full of old cucumber.  Chicken pita was decent.  Lots of filling.  Just not fresh though.Quite upset about the tabouleh salad mixup.",I waited over an hour for delivery. Then when the food came it was complete different from what I ordered. I'm very disappointed.,Amazing.. priceless falafels. Place needs to be in the top five falafel spots in NYC.,"Pahal Zan is the type of place that you expect to find in NYC but are never easy to spot.  A hole in the wall place that cares so much about their food but still is small and sort of hidden.Every time I go in I see all of their meats waiting to be grilled and every time I say next time I'll try something else.  Something else always becomes the same thing that next time.  I have only had their falafel pita.   It is so good and so much better than any other I have ever had.   The falafel is so crispy but not dense on the outside.  They have a soft inside that bursts with taste.   The vegetable are fresh and the tahini has no heavy sesame taste.  The other thing that makes their falafel pita better than others is how they layer the sandwich.  They put falafel on the bottom, a layer of veggies, a layer of falafel and another layer of veggies.Pahal Zan is kosher so they aren't open Friday nights and Saturdays.","Pahal Zan doesn't exactly have bad ratings, but it's still kind of under-rated. It's a small Middle Eastern and Israeli takeout place tucked away near a bridge. I ordered a kebab platter. It came with seven salads and three pitas. The menu was slightly off about what the salads were, though that didn't make much of a difference to me. The meat was seasoned well. I didn't care for the roasted eggplant salad, but I liked the others. The portions were generous. They give you twice as much as other nearby Middle Eastern restaurants like OBA. I could barely finish it. Definitely worth stopping by.","Delicious pita sandwiches. I had a pita sandwich with grilled chicken, hummus, Israeli salad, cabbage, hot sauce, and tahini sauce. Very well seasoned and super flavorful. The sandwich is filling and fairly priced at $10. One of the best pita sandwiches that I've had in New York. I wish they had rotating spits with shawarma.",Pahal Zan
573,Hey Jake..  thanks for replying to my shake shack horrendous post. Is there a way I can give you my email etc privately?Thanks,"Service is HORRENDOUS!  Whoever is in charge of staffing should be fired. I know it's huge customer base at a ballgame but with proper staffing shouldn't be more than 45 mins EVER.  90 MINUTES and missed 4 innings of game. 1 cashier, waaay too few staff to handle customers.","These guys never make the food correctly. Every single time, my burger is undercooked. I request WELL DONE each time and its never well done. Always items missing. I dont know why I even bother.","The line is always so extremely long that I miss multiple innings because of it, but I decided to take a chance during a recent Mets game. Only missed 2 innings at the beginning of the game, but it was definitely worth it. There's something about eating Shake Shack at the best baseball stadium (long-suffering Mets fan here) and enjoying a beautiful night of baseball (despite another Mets loss). Overall, this Shake Shack didn't disappoint -- just be prepared to wait on line for a long time. As long as you have good company and pay attention to the game on the TV while waiting, you should be good to go!","This Shake Shack in Citi Field has a limited menu & a pretty long line, but you can't deny that it just tastes better eating that delicious little burger while watching baseball. It's an American tradition!!! The shroom burger is awesome too for you vegetarians.","You know I used to love shake shack ever since they opened, but I feel like their meat quality has gone down. Last time I came here with my parents the meat tasted completely different and I didn't even finish my burger. Fries are really good, but burger, i dont know it has changed.

574,"Came with family, party of 9. They missed one of the salads so we spent 5minutes arguing with the waitress on how many soups/salads should have been served. Really could and should have been handled differently. Penny pinching when they're in the wrong leaves a bad taste in the mouth, especially when you know you're spending hundreds. On top of that, the waitress did not come over to check on us even once the entire meal. No water refills. Keeping in mind this was a Wednesday evening with half the restaurant empty so being busy was not an acceptable excuse. 18% gratuity was mandatory regardless of the quality of service.  The busboy did more than our waitress. No longer my go to sushi spot in Queens.",Many sushi  places in n Astoria. As I always say eating out is an experience. The service was horrible. The restaurant was a quarter full. My gal pal sake and my martini was served then in a minute the salad was served and my soup. I made a mistake and I blinked. Our sushi was served. I didn't get a chance to sip my martini. There were no room on my table. I started to pile the dishes on the table. Of course my gal pal was angry. The food? The soup was ok and the sushi was good and fresh. I almost forgot to mention about food because of the service. Will I be back? I will give the place another chance. Maybe it was a newbie server.,"When one person ruins it for everyone in the ​restaurant. The food is good, probably the best sushi in Astoria but the person taking the orders could not be more rude. I mean no people skills and she is taking your order?  really the management​  should​ consider her position​​.","Hands down THE best sushi in Astoria and honestly one of the best that I've had thus far. I have been coming here for yearsssss and always look forward to going back after every meal. The ambiance and decor is just lovely with a nice cozy date like vibe. My go to appetizer is always the Seafood Dynamite! Grilled chopped shrimp, scallop and mushroom w. mayonnaise, its mouth wateringly deliscious!The rolls I got were:Bumble Bee Roll - Spicy crab meat, cucumber, avocado inside topped w. fresh mangoDynamite Roll - Spicy tuna inside, topped w. crunchy spicy crab meatLobster Roll - Fresh steamed lobster & avocado topped w. black tobikoBumble Bee Roll and Dynamite Roll are my absolute favorite and never let me down. Decided to try a new roll and got the Lobster Roll which unfortunately was a let down. It was very hard to chew and tasted bland. We let out server know and he happily replaced that roll with a roll of out choice so we got the Pauline Roll which had Shrimp tempura inside, topped w. crunchy spicy crab meat. Def another favorite to the list.The service is always humble and welcoming.Never a disappointment here!","Pretty sure this is the only sushi place in my neighborhood as I can't remember getting from anywhere else In the past 7 years. Lunch special Is priced like in Manhattan, so no real value there in my opinion. Fish Is always fresh and it's never too busy when you go to dine in the restaurant. Outdoor seating provides prime people viewing along the busy Ditmars Ave.","No complaints at all from start to finish. Ambience was nice; we were seated in the back by an indoor ""pond."" Slightly overpowering floral scents used, but otherwise we enjoyed the atmosphere. Had two apps, Yellowtail Toro Jalapeño and Miso Chilean Seabass, both very nicely done. Sashimi Combo and Chirashi for entrees and the fish was fresh and spot on. Will definitely come again!",Watawa Sushi
575,"Note that this is a review for Tonkatsu to go and not the restaurant itself.Halfway through eating my donburi bowl and realized the middle of the pork tasted funny.. then realized it is not cooked through in the middle. The meat is a clear color, and does not look like it is cooked, thus the weird taste and chewy feeling.Threw the rest of the food out, have picture as well but dont think anyone would appreciate a pic of my half biten into meat piece.. I will not be returning, too bad because I'm a regular here and everything has been good so far...","Stumbled upon this place through the help of Yelp. During our stay in New York, we were over pizza and wanted something different. If you're in the area, I highly suggest you stop by and try them out. They weren't that busy on a Monday night so the food didn't take too long to come out. We ordered grilled squid and 2 combo meals. I honestly don't know if you can find a cheaper but yet authentic Japanese eatery in New York.","Come here if you're looking for a very authentic Japanese dining experience. Upon being seated, I noticed that I was the only non-Japanese customer for a Friday night dinner. Everything was well flavorful and came with various difference topping sauces and spices to add and customize our meals. We ordered fried oyster fries, and gyu-meshi.","Loved everything about this place starting, of course, with the taste and quality of our meal!Bottom line on this place: AMAZING prices, delicious food, PIPING HOT fresh from the kitchen, clean and bright interior, excellent and fast service and icing on the cake: NO TIPPING! What more could you ask for in a dining experience?! Overall dining value = priceless! :)We had just been to Japan on vacation and experienced authentic Japanese tonkatsu and this place immediately brought us back there even as we stepped through the front entrance with their plastic food display case! The place is not big but the seating is not cramped and crowded. It's clean, inviting and open. We arrived for an early dinner - around 5PM. Service was excellent and though the food didn't arrive lickety-split, it came out shortly thereafter and PIPING HOT - a sign that they cook to order. Signs on the wall ask customers to be patient because of this. Like fine wine, good deep fried tonkatsu cannot be rushed! :)While there, we saw a lot of customers come in to place carry out orders. Also there's a street-facing To-Go storefront. Party of 5 (adults). We ordered the edamame appetizer, their basic Pork Loin Cutlet Tonkatsu (Teisyoku set), their Beef and Tonkatsu Bowl (Large Aomori Gyu-Meshi Bowl) and their grilled mackerel dish (Saba Shioyaki). All were delicious. The tonkatsu was COOKED PERFECTLY. Perfectly breaded for that nice crunch factor, pork was juicy and tender and the size of each cutlet was substantial. The Bowls had the right mix of rice, tonkatsu and beef - a tasty combo. Bowl items are accompanied by a bowl of shredded cabbage and a miso soup. The cabbage dressing was delicious and refreshing (though messy when it's poured out). All the condiments and sauces are on the table (jut like in Japan!). When you're finished your meal, ask for the check, head to the counter to pay, NO TIP REQUIRED OR EVEN ENCOURAGED!, then go! So refreshing! How many times you gonna find that in NYC at a full service restaurant - or anywhere here in the US for that matter - ?!Heaven on earth! HIGHLY RECOMMEND and may even be back during our short visit - we enjoyed it THAT much.","Came here on my way back from JFK with my suitcase in tow, which the hostess kindly stored behind a counter. I was seated immediately, although there was definitely a lunch rush right after! The katsu was so good and hot and came on a little metal stand so it wouldn't get soggy. It paired perfectly with the cabbage salad, tonkatsu sauce, miso dressing (? on counter), and the horseradish-y paste that came on the plate. Rice and miso soup were just ok. No tipping! Great place for a quick but hot & delicious meal.","This day I went to this Katsu joint, you know, switch things up from my usual ramen trips. Katsu is like in top 3 of japanese dishes so I might start going on a Katsu trip one of these days....maybe after I try EVERY ramen restaurant lol.Anyway, on to the food review. I ordered pork loin 150 gram don, comes with a soup like egg on top of it. The katsu was still somewhat crispy and the flavor was all there. I wish I could say more but I'm not an expert on katsu dons....I'll do more research before my next katsu stop!And yes, I recommend everyone to try this place out!",Tonkatsu Matsunoya

I also tried the retried beans they're we're yummy.","I came by for dinner last night and i usually only order tacos, tostadas and quesadillas. However, tonight i was in the mood for a chicken and mole; so i ordered the meal which comes with mexican rice, a small portion of shredded lettuce and 4 enchiladas. I am happy to tell you the wife loved the tacos al pastor, my daughter had a steak quesadilla which was huge, the tongue taco did not have a lot of taste. We wanted chicken tinga but they were out of it.The mile was a bit bitter, although it was seasoned well in my opinión it was too thick and could have benefited from being strained a bit more so it could have a smoother consistency. Clearly i can see all the spices that were added to the mole, it lacked a bit of a hint of sweetness either from peanut butter or sugar. Mole is such a sensitive sauce that if you overcook it, you can instantaneously damage the sauce. I will say this, i am staying away from mole at least the one they make here; since it lacks refinement. The best mole i had so far was at another restaurant in sunny side called ""de mole"" that place has excellent enchiladas verdes and mole. However their tacos are just ok.",Mi Espiguita Taqueria

I was so excited to use this and of course I let my friends know about this as well. When my friends showed the bartenders the offer, they were clearly not happy about it.

I should not have even tasted them to be honest because from the look of them, i should have known something was ""fishy"" there.  They were a weird brown/grey color. There is a rule that fresh seafood should NOT taste like fish. Well not only did they crab cakes taste like REALLY bad fish, but it was mushy and im sure filled with low quality crab and tons of breading.  SKIP SKIP SKIP the crab cakes. Please. Trust me.  The coconut shrimp looked so appetizing, but that was all it was. The first bite I was impressed.. second bite .. eh... third bite.. sigh... i gave up. SKIP SKIP SKIP! lol. yuck.My mother ordered: crab cakes and fries.  Her experience with the crab cakes were exactly the same. However i will say this... they french fries were amazing!   strange when the best part of the meal is fries... The waitress that we had was SUPER nice. She saw that we were not touching the crab cakes after one bite and came right over. I told her that they were deff OFF, and she quickly took the plates away and asked if we would like something else. I told her NO THANK YOU but my mother opted for a Cesar salad.  The salad was good she said also.Honestly, i am only giving this place two stars because the waitress was super nice and i liked the atmosphere.","Have been coming to Woodhaven House for years with family and friends.  One of the better burgers in Queens and the toppings are the best part. Irish bacon, fried leeks make the burger a great one.  Tons of beer on tap including local drafts from Finback Brewery.",Woodhaven House
579,I've eaten here twice...both times...were............delicious.The pistachio pizza is phenomenal. It will symbolically replace your children.Positivity is key!,Mediocre Middle Eastern food truck food served seated.  Decor service all good. Too many items on the menu gives you the hint. Obviously can't be all Superb. I would eliminate 1/2 of the items and focus on the finesse if it was my restaurant. I would go again no problem but with a lot less expectation.,"I like this place. I ordered The Mediterranean Omelette, it's really deliciousand. The atmosphere gives moody date night realness.","Been here 3 times since they redid the space and menu and will keep returning! Definitely improved since before the reno. One main guy has taken my order each time and been super helpful and attentive. Portions are all generous and prices are super fair!! Happy hour 5-7 I believe but booze prices on a regular basis are all good anyways. Would definitely recommend the chicken bowl with rice and salad and pita chips. Place is great for friends, a date, fam, whatever. Will hopefully try brunch sometime soon.",Walked by this place a few times before deciding to give it a try. Very dimly lit which makes it ideal for an intimate dinner. Food is very delicious and consistent. Would recommend the Chicken and rice bowl!,"Dar 525 was fantastic. The portions were great, the flavors were delicious, and the brunch prices are super enticing as well!!! The Mediterranean open face omelette was super filling and super sizeable. The shakshuka was delicious and the eggs were cooked nicely as well. The pita they serve you is always super fresh, toasty, and puffy with steam! Be careful of your hands when you tear into that steam filled pita pocket! The flavors were good, food was delicious, portions were generous, prices were good. All in all, would recommend everything I got!!",Dar 525
580,"It saddens me to write this. It's just not the same anymore. It's been years since I've come here and still remember what the king of halal used to be like. They were the best spot for a while and I don't know what happened because they are not even remotely close to how they used to be. Judging by the reviews lately, I know I'm not the only one that feels this way. They either fell off really hard, or new owners, new recipes, who the hell knows...but I do know its not the Sammy's I used to love. The easiest way to describe it....it's watered down. The old Sammy's use to not be afraid of holding back on the spices and flavors. Hitting all the flavor profiles that left you confused in a good way that you just kept wanting more. This recent endeavor was subpar and truly disappointing. I'll give it one more shot just in case it was really that off that night, but to be that off, it doesn't make sense. Please bring back the old Sammy's...Stay fat mother suckers",Apparently I'm not the only one but I ordered off of Postmates and did not receive what I ordered. Are usually go to them in person since it's convenient to the train and bus but never again will I order off of an app. I'm confuse how a little hot sauce and extra white sauce turns into extra Hot sauce and no white sauce at all.,I ventured off to this place a few years ago and it wasn't bad. However on my most recent visit I was highly disappointed. As kind of a self proclaimed halal specialist and ventured off to many halal carts in and around the city. Sammy's definitely doesn't come close to a top contender. I thought that the quantity was fairly poor and also the quality of the chicken and gyro meat was appalling.Maybe back in the day these guys used to be the king in queens however they don't stand a chance. Basic low quality halal spot overall.,Best Halal food in the city. Very consistent.  I've been going since 2009 and will continue to travel from Brooklyn to grab a few plates. Ask for the green sauce!!!,"Totally more than 5-Star worthy! Sammy's is the perfect combination of savory and spice. I'm only here in NY for a couple days and heard about Sammy's- specifically their amazing sauces- on several YouTube foodie channels and other reviews I read. I knew it would have to be one of the first stops I made. My husband and I arrived around 7:30pm on a Sunday evening. There were about 3 people in front of us.  We waited only 5-10 min to place our order. The guys were really friendly and worked quickly to get our food ready. We found a seat on the edge of a nearby planter to eat. No need to add sauces, Sammy's puts them on for you. That combination of the red, white and green sauces was addicting! So so good!  The chicken and rice was abundant and flavorful. The little bit of salad was needed spice relief and welcomed for me but if you don't want it, ask them to leave it out. Sammy's has canned sodas and bottled water offered to go with your meal too. I'm going to be sad to leave NY and not have access to this food cart at home. Sammy's, please bottle your sauces so I can take them home with me!","Amazing!! Being from out of town, whenever you hear about Halal, you think of Halal guys. I found Sammy's to be much better than that! Their rice is so perfectly cooked with the right level of spice. The chicken was tender and the white sauce they have is so unbelievably delicious that I could have drank it. The prices were extremely reasonable and I left full. No complaints here and I will be ordering again soon!",Sammy's Halal Food
581,"I am a regular customer also always order for delivery. Just very disappointed my food today. They choose to lose customer instead of recook the new food for me. Picture speak itself. Very very disappointed. How can the kitchen let this kind of food out form them, 2nd packer should see this and say something about it. Very very bad. Ask yourself, if you are not gonna eat this kind of shit how can your customer eat it. No more support from me. They should know there are thousand of restaurants pop up everyday, so many options for customer in this area. Wish the management see my message!!.","Horrible service. The waitress keeps ignoring you , food is below average. the table seems so dirty. What's more ridiculous is they take tips by themselves WITHOUT asking you. You give then the money and they just TAKE the tips BY THEMSELVES, which is 18% after tax. And it's cash only. You don't tell me how much tip I should give!!! What kind of service is that? DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE. You will be amazed how terrible they are.","Horrible service. The waitress keeps ignoring you , food is below average the table seems so dirty. What's more ridiculous is they take tips by themselves WITHOUT asking you. You give then the money and they just calculated the tips and give you the change after their ""calculated tips"". What the f?????? What kind of service is that? DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE. You will be amazed how terrible they are.","Chao Thai has been in our bucket list for months due to Michelin recommendation and we finally got a chance to try. Their decor is really old school and they don't have many tables but it wasn't crowded since most of people do take out or delivery.Their food is quite authentic and delicious. We ordered Thai Salad, Pattaya mussels pan fried, pineapple and duck red curry and black egg with basil. All dishes were amazingly great and our favorite dish was red curry, the duck in the curry was soft but with crispy skin, we loved red curry with peanut. Their service was welcoming and friendly. They served everything quickly even there were lots of orders. Our only complaints are Cash Only and they will automatically add tips on the check.","For me this place have authentic Thai food.I like drunken noodles and Thai iced tea.Good service, friendly staff. Go with family, friends or by yourself.","Tonight my husband and I tried out this Thai restaurant for the first time. Most of the food was lovely and whilst we were inside the restaurant the staff provided good service. There was only one starter that neither my husband and I enjoyed. However that was down to personal taste and not their cooking.  However I got the feeling us not eating the dish may have caused offence as they asked three times if we wanted it bagged to take home. Then they asked why we didn't want to take the leftovers home. This restaurant is cash only, so we got what we thought would be enough for meal plus tip. However the meal came to a little more than we expected, leaving less for tip. However we left all the change we had, and begin to leave the restaurant. We were outside walking to the bus stop and my husband was saying how lovely the restaurant was and how we would definitely go back. However at that moment the waitress came outside holding the tip we had left and shouting at us, saying that we hadn't left enough of a tip--that it wasn't 15%. The last time I checked as much as tipping in the USA is common place and part of the culture; there is no obligation or legal requirement to tip any amount, never mind 15%. If the restaurant had the facility to accept card payments, we would have been able to tip a larger amount, as could have included the tip on the card payment. However by insisting on cash only it limited the amount we were able to tip. Furthermore, chasing us down the street for a larger tip is abysmal business management. The staff in this restaurant obviously do not realise that by doing this a) they are never getting our business again. b) we will tell friends and family not to provide them with business and c) it made sure that they got no tip at all. For anyone who does venture to this restaurant, you better overestimate how much cash you will need to cover meal and tip. Otherwise you will probably also get chased down the street for more money.",Chao Thai
582,"I just came from this place.  Food was good, and service was good as well. However, consumer beware!!! We were a party of 3! And they have included the tip of 18%. They didnt call it gratuity nor tip, but a charge fee.  Yes, they also charged us tax. Well because tip was included, we paid the bill.  The 'manager' came out to our table, very rude, indicating why we didnt pay tip. We explained it was included. He took all receipts to check, then came back apologizing that he didnt know it was included.  However, if we wanted to, to re-do everything because the 18% they charged was done before taxes, so it didnt amount to a real 18%. We were shocked after paying over $140 in food. Shame shame shame...I wonder how many people get charged this 'charge fee' and get additional tip.  Left a bad taste","I see that the biggest complaint about Luna Bistro is the service and maybe we came on a good day but I kind of liked the service. It wasn't the best service but the waiter was well intentioned and even accommodated us when we moved to a different table. Luna is a good place to go to for its views and though the rooftop section is not high up - you can still see much of Queens, the Bronx and even some buildings in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Unfortunately lower Manhattan is obscured by the tall disastrous crap buildings that house the gentrifiers that occupy Long Island City.Okay so service is fine and the view is good but the outdoor area is also nice - though its not nice in a Miami no expense spared kind of way but more in a humble Queens way. Unfortunately the food is not as good as the view.  Because there were six of us we had several different orders of sushi and it really tasted like buffet sushi. We also had a few noodles dishes which were passable if not memorable. There were several of us and no one had food that would be considered bad, maybe not the greatest but not bad. Come here for the drinks, rooftop deck, and views and you won't be disappointed.","Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night and not too crowded. So let's start with the positives. It's a rooftop restaurant and the view of the city is stunning. It is Japanese fusion as advertised. The food was amazing. We had adamame, an eel and avocado roll, a king crab and avocado roll and pan seared bass to share. The reason we ordered the pan seared bass to share was because it was listed under ""chef's specials"" right beneath the whole fried fish and cost $30 dollars. Well, it was definitely NOT shareable.  It was delicious. But $30? Really? But the worst part of the experience was the wait staff. We asked for water 3 times over a span of 20 minutes before we got it. Parts of our order kept getting forgotten, like the spicy mayo (which they do charge for as a side) and the extra side of brown rice. I mean, the wait staff was polite and all, but very disorganized.","Came by on a Friday evening to take advantage of the nice weather. Wasn't expecting much as most rooftops are over expensive and crowded. However, this spot had plenty of seating on two different levels.Prices here aren't bad either - ordered the Spicy Crunchy Tuna Roll ($6), White Tuna Sashimi ($3), and an Asahi ($6.50). Sushi and sashimi are your standard fare; fine with some soy sauce. Also ordered the Dry Sake ($8) which complimented the meal better than the beer.Pretty much your standard sushi spot but with a better view. Good place to chill in the area if avoiding crowds.","Came here with a friend who wanted to surprise me with dinner and a view. And can i just say the view was well worth it. Only go here if you can get rooftop seating otherwise leave and go to the hundreds of other restaurants in the area. The roof is beautiful honestly it was the best part of the entire experience. The staff was friendly enough but the service was terrible. It took nearly 45 minutes for us to receive our food, our waitress taking her time to even come and take our order. It just seemed like everyone was working in a different time zone. The food itself wasn't terrible but it wasn't good. Visually it was appealing but I've had better sushi that was less overpriced if I'm being completely honest. This place has the appeal of rooftop seating but honestly that's it. Go for the pictures you can take not for the food you'll be disappointed by is my parting message.","I absolutely love the rooftop and think this is great for friends, date night or after work meet up. The food was just okay. Ive certainly had better sushi and absolutely did not like the fried ice cream which consisted of more batter than ice cream. Overall I'm giving 4 stars based on the decor, and ambiance.",LUNA  Asian Bistro & Lounge
583,"This is one of my favorite things in flushing (and the lamb noodle soup). Hard to find since they had to move, but its somewhere over Stanford now. Obviously get the lamb, but everything is phenomenal here.",Get the lamb. Get the spices on it. The only thing I regret is not getting 20 for my walk around flushing. I would come to flushing JUST for this cart,YAS. These Lamb Skewers are LEGIT. Like Beijing-level legit.,"Sometimes the simplest of foods, when done right, are truly the best. Xinjiang BBQ cart does bbq right and if you are blessed to come across the dude who makes them, do yourself a favor and drop by to get yourself some. Even after being full of eating all around Flushing, I couldn't resist helping myself to a skewer once I smelled the well-seasoned meat over a flaming charcoal grill. There seems to be several bbq options, but I just went with the lamb. And within a few quick minutes, he gets them out to you and can make it spicier upon request. Yes, some of the pieces of meat were pretty fatty, but I'm not going to pretend like I didn't enjoy it because I did haha. At $1.50 per skewer, I'll definitely be back to treat myself to some more Xinjiang BBQ.","Delicious street snack on a cold winter day! Made an impromptu visit as I was getting my mini egg cakes, these guys were set up next to that cart. Good variety of meats, they also have less common items like gizzard too. We ended up grabbing a lamb skewer and a squid skewer.The lamb was very juicy (mostly because it was fatty), flavoursome and well-seasoned. Some people said it was awkward eating it as it would stick to the wooden skewer but I didn't have this problem. At a dollar and some change, it was money well spent.My husband had the squid. Though I love seafood, I didn't particularly like the squid, I felt the spice mix used on it didn't work. With seafood, basic is best, it has its natural flavours from the ocean so a light sprinkle of salt and pepper with a touch of lemon would have worked wonders. In saying this, the squid itself seemed to be good quality and well cooked (squid is super easy to overcook) so they've done well in that respect.The skewers won't fill an empty stomach but if you're feeling peckish and want a snack, definitely worth the money. Even if you're not hungry, you will be after being seduced by the aromas coming from the cart ;)","Great price for great flavors! Each skewer costs about $1.50 per skewer. Meat was incredibly tender and flavorful! Cumin and red chili powder adds a whole depth of flavor and texture. Only complaint is probably there was a little too much fatty meat on it, and the skewer seems smaller compared to Fat Ni",Xinjiang BBQ Cart
584,"Horrible!!! And the outside area smells like garbage juice and urine, how can anyone eat out there??",i use to love sea wolf but i think there food sucks an i there are alotta good looking women tha come there but that's it also i'm starting to see tha sea wolf is not da place for me an da customer service is very poor smh,I waited 40 MINUTES for FISH TACOS!!! Don't eat here if you're hungry or if you have somewhere to be after. They really are unconcerned about getting your food out to you in a timely manner. I even waited to pay the bill!!! Ridiculous!! And the bill was WET!,"The aesthetic alone sets the mood before you even sit down. There was a wait but they handle it efficiently. Didn't get to try the brunch but the dinner was on point. They have great music selection also (that matters to me) Tye playlist was on point! I had the lobster Mac, shrimp roll and clam strips, all were tasty, would definitely revisit. The 4 stars is only because they messed my order up initially. But the place is GREAT!","Dogs everywhere. And you might think...OMG...I love fluffy and giggles! But this turned me off. And I'm fine with places that are dog friendly but this is on another level. Dogs sitting on chairs, putting their paws on the table where people have to sit and eat. I saw a dog lick a napkin. Nah bruh. People have serious deathly dog allergies. For me it feels very unsanitary unless you're wiping down each table and seats with some sorta all natural vinegar cleaning agent or a bleachy mixture. I know all the dog lovers are gonna hate me. But this is like a person putting a dog on the subway seat. Ya feel me. No. I'm cool with your support animal but they belong in a carrier or on the floor. Next thing. Had to ask for utensils...after the first round of food was on the table. Small but annoying. Now let's get to the food and drinks.I went during happy hour and had the painkiller, which reminded me of a Pina colada. Sweet and refreshing but not boozy. It was only $6. I shared a dozen $1 oysters with my friend. They were juicy, sweet and not too briny. Nice size too. Yummm! I did see this weird worm on the back of my oyster shell. Kinda freaked me out. I get it! They come from the ocean. I've sent countless oysters to their grave but never saw a worm on it. I don't have bubble guts today so I guess it's not a problem. Yay! Everything is awesomeeee.I ordered the steam pot with the added lobster. Spent $56 bucks on it. I am going to be honest and say it wasn't worth it. I've had better lobsters. I've made better lobsters. It was overcooked and not seasoned. Guess it didn't get an old Bay/salt bath. It was underwhelming but trust I ate my money's worth. Shells everywhere. Juices flying. Shells cracking. It was a glorious show. People were staring. I should've sold tickets. Lmao. The overall steam pot flavor was delicious. It was a rich red sauce, well balanced with tomatoes, tons of fresh garlic, and thyme! I could've just had that and been satisfied. But my mood was Treat Yoself YOLO! The clams were plump, juicy, and flavorful. The mussels were also succulent and sweet. The cod was bland. It had no flavor at all. I had to spoon it with the broth. The andouille was nice and spicy. There were also fingerling potatoes. You get 2 large half pieces of toasted bread to soak in the beautiful sauce and all those drippings. My friend had the Sea Wolf which is a burger, shoe string fries, a pickle, a small arugula salad and half a lobster. She thought the lobster was going to be draped across the patty but it was on the side. FYI. She loved it. If it weren't for the dog thing I could've given them a 3/4. It's a very popular spot. Outdoor and indoor seating. Gender neutral bathrooms. But I think it could've helped to have an additional person on staff. They need some stricter dog friendly rules. It was my first experience and probably my last.","I had there fish and chips( shoestring chips with herbs).Fish was fresh, and good batter but not oily, as you would get in Maine.My husband had the fish taco, looked really good, it came with guacamole which was good, nice grilled fish . The taco was softshell, which is flour and prefer over corn (which I find to be gritty)Their  signature drink , to me is  cross from daiquiri and pina colada There chicken wings looked good and almost every table ordered, next time Illl try.   They also had cauliflower  wihc appear to be same batter as chicken wings.Only negative is the seats inside are not comfortable.",Sea Wolf
585,"***Delivery Review***Saturday night, wanted to order in some Mexican food without feeling too guilty about not walking there. This spot had no delivery fee and a relatively small order minimum of $15.Menu is a tad on the expensive side, yet the pictures looked pretty good. Settled on the Chicken Burrito ($10) and the Guacamole with Chips ($10). Delivery arrives in about half an hour with utensils and two kinds of hot sauces in the bag. Guacamole is both chunky and flavorful without being too aggressive on the lime juice. This went well with the thick-cut tortilla chips (not warm, but they could've lost heat). On the flip side, the burrito was a disappointment. The meat was salty and even had a few pieces of tough cartilage inside. Rice and beans didn't have too much flavor and not much cheese or sour cream to balance it out. The side salad it is served with actually turned out to be better than the entree.Feel like this spot is hit or miss depending on what you order. Probably wouldn't get the chicken again.","I order from here through Seamless all the time and I'm constantly disappointed whenever I stray away from the tacos, which are excellent. The beet salad is made with canned beets (not roasted as they claim), the burritos taste as though they were pre-made and frozen a month in advance, a quesadilla that I ordered recently tasted like old fish, and the entrees are consistently a disaster. Quite simply, I don't think that the kitchen staff has the culinary skills necessary to make anything other than tacos. I'm giving them two stars for the tacos, because they are very good, but everything else is just flat out bad.","The food is very good but I've never found the atmosphere or the staff welcoming in the slightest. In fact, I think they are usually rude and stand offish. My sense is that if they don't think you're from the neighborhood, then they are going to be dismissive.","Bros, this is the BEST mexican restaurant I have EVER been to. I am from Texas (specifically Houston) where there is a huge Mexican population and therefore, our Mexican food is pretty authentic and good. THIS IS BETTER! It's like taking a trip to the heart of Mexico and going to the most local/delicious restaurant that all the locals know about and don't want to tell tourists about. We used Yelp to order and really loved our sandwich & soup as well as the free chip thing they serve you. Besides that, they also give you free chips + 4 different sauces!!! They also have aqua frescas and one of the flavors was watermelon ($4 watermelon juice!!)This place is amazing. The servers were also very nice and accommodating.","I don't make it to Jackson Heights often because parking is terrible, but the rare times that I do, I look forward to eating at Juquila because I know the authenticity of the food that is served here. We came in on a Sunday around 1pm, and so my sister and I ordered cemitas, which are traditional Mexican sandwiches served on a sesame roll with a papalo leaf inside that gives it a unique flavor. I ordered a carne asada cemita without salsa and avocado (cause I'm weird like that), and my father ordered costillas en salsa verde, my mother had consome. My sister and I had agua de jamaica to drink (Hibiscus tea), my mother had champurrado, a type of atole, and my father had a michelada, a mix of beer with tomato juice. As we waited for our food, I was snapping pictures of the decor that the owner brought over from Mexico as our server explained, and sang along to the Mexican pop/rock music that I so often hear in my own home. When our food arrived, the smells of the broth and papalo leaf filled the table and we said ""provecho"" and attacked. I think none of us spoke until about 10 minutes later as we were just enjoying our food that much. I had a bit of my mom's lamb consome, and my father's pork costillas, and they were both to die for. We left full and in a bit of a food coma. I thought to myself how I have to make it an effort to come here more often, and to bring my friends who always ask for a genuine Mexican spot they could try. The food served here hits home for all of us, I highly recommend it.","Ordered delivery and the food came in 30 minutes: pretty good.  The tostada was crunchy and the chicken was grilled well but salty. This tostada just wasn't good.  The cheese just added more saltiness and the lettuce was flimsy; not fresh and crunchy. The burrito was stuffed with meat, rice, beans and lettuce.... a typical burrito but like the tostada the meat was so salty, grilled well but hard to eat because of the high sodium. The salad on the side was very plain and did nothing for the burrito. The side sauces were a fail because they were very watery and so the lime taste was compromised. The guac in the sauce just didn't hold up to the water so it didn't even look right. I have heard great things about this place and it's always busy when I pass by. I think I will try this place again but not as delivery.Mera's Tip: try ordering earlier in the day.",Juquila Mexican Cuisine
586,"Hi Willis, thanks for your quick response and teach me the resource of your tradition. But, it made me felt worse. I mentioned 3 facts: iced cubes, mushy & sticky noodle and bad service. Your explains sounds like avoid telling the crucial points. If your service were better even someone said something, I would not so disappointed.I have eaten Korean cold noodle from another Korean restaurants, which are totally different from yours. Now I realized they're ""fake"" Korean food.","Today is not the first time but is the worst one. We ordered cold noodles came with iced cubes, most of them were over boiled and some of them were sticked. We have bought cold noodles package from Hmark even much better than it. I told waiter and cashier, but nobody responded.The service is horrible. The food is pricy and not worthy it at all. We're living around the restaurant, it was one of my favorite Korean restaurants. No more from today and never come back again.","I went here a few times for some Korean food, the tall/older Korean gentleman is super kind and professional, but just as other reviewers have pointed out, there are some very rude workers here. Not all, just a few. One Korean lady with auburn hair, likes to stare because I'm not Korean, but doesn't seem to like it when I stare back at her for not being American...lol. And there is one big, heavy-set Korean woman, who had the nerve to ask for at least a 10% tip before I left. Here's a tip...don't spend half the night in the bathroom destroying the toilet and plumbing, and also try running some of that weight off.  If you want excellent Korean food, go to Jong-Ro off of Northern Blvd. Gahwa...I do not recommend","I like the convenience of Gahwa's location and availability of parking as it shares a parking lot with Hmart. Whenever I'm here, I usually get the sullongtang (ox bone soup); it's so rich in flavor, hearty and comforting. (If you park in the back, you'll see as you're walking through the hallway the huge vats of soup boiling away.) It is served unseasoned (as tradition), so you can add salt, pepper and scallions to your taste. Add rice and eat with kimchi. Simple, but classic. Their kimchi is BOMB and they serve two kinds: napa cabbage and diced radish. Both are delicious! I've ordered bibibimbap and LA galbi to go. Both dishes were good, but standard. Each dish is served with a side of soup though which ended up turning into a third meal. #winning",There's a large parking lot in the back of the restaurant. I came with a group of 10 at 7:30pm on a weekday and we were seated immediately. The server was also very accommodating when we needed more seats since we ended up having more people than we expected. The restaurant is most famous for their seolleongtang (ox bone soup). Season the soup according to taste with the salt and ground pepper provided at the table. The restaurant provides a lot of side dishes to go along with your meal as well. All in all it's a great casual restaurant with great comfort Korean food.,Food: 3/5Great place for sullungtang. I've always preferred their other location on Northern Blvd but that location closed. This location doesn't have soondaegook which is a bummer. Great place to dine if you're craving bone broth soup. Their kimchi is one of the best I've had. They also have oxtail as an option. Don't forget to add scallions and salt!This location is open 24 hours!!Service: 4/5The ladies in here are very accommodating.Ambiance: 3.5/5Typical Korean establishment. Pretty simple and clean. They have a big parking lot in the back.,Gahwa Korean Restaurant
587,"3.5 stars but I'll round it up to 4.The food at Hot Peppers, despite its name, is not spicy. They serve build your own burrito or burrito bowl. Prices are affordable and the food is Halal. I had a beef burrito bowl, which was filling. Guacamole is included but if you want more than one scoop it costs extra. I didn't like the texture of the beef. It was cubed and slightly on the hard, chewy side. Not bad, but not great either. I would go with the shredded meats.",Went here for a quick bite. If your in the area and your looking for a quick bite then you should go here.,"I enjoyed the food, the review did not saveService was great, did not like the queso but would repeat as they have quality food and offer specials throughout the week","This a place with wonderful food and friendly staffs! Let me just make this statement as my first paragraph.I usually visited this place after my workout routine since I exercised heavily and I need protein and veggies quickly. Recently I fell in love with Mexican food and this place is where you can find authentic (at least in my humble opinion) and affordable food.  Let me point out directly what I found this store is different from Chipotle: 1. Their chicken is less salty which I think it's great. 2. Much cheaper than Chipotle- You get Guac without additional charge. Super!!!- You can have tofu and another protein in your bowel. 3. Food is fresh. 4. Affordable (Did I just say that a second time?) - A bowel cost you about $8 ish. You know how much you will be paying if you eat at Chipotle. - They have lunch special and everything is $6!!!!5. Friendly Staffs!!!!!!!!!! :D 6. First responders (EMT, FF, NYPD) gets 10% off My parents got interested in Mexican food because I brought their food home so often LOL Definitely will bring more and share to them next time!!!

Today I typed food near my dr office and there it was!!! $6.00 for a quality burrito bowl of delicious ingredients. vegetarian options are available which is perfect for when im not on the little ""Intermission"" from my usual lifestyle.  I got beef with brown rice and toppings that didnt have raw red onion. The service was helpful and seperated some of the peppers (they were mixed with raw red onion) for me :) i wish my onion allergy would go on an ""intermission"" everytime I crave MEXICAN ...SOOO... ALWAYS!","Food: AMAZING! Ordered 2 times here for lunch at work this week. It's similar to Qdoba but even better! Fresh and filling. Orders are filled accurately and they have interesting sauce options that are delicious such as chimichurri and a lemon herb sauce. They don't charge extra for guac or queso either :) The ""Kissy Mango"" drink was delicious too! Kind of like a Mango mojito sans the alcohol. Note: They are halal certifiedDisclaimer: I've only ordered UberEats and never set foot in the store so I can't judge on cleanliness or friendliness but judging from the huge happy face drawn on my ubereats bag, I think they are pretty darn friendly :)",Hot Peppers
588,I think I visited this place expecting entirely too much. I ordered two tacos and they were just okay. They didn't have all of the garnishing you come to expect from restaurants who specialize in tacos but the guacamole was very creamy and tasted fresh. They don't have an alcohol license so expect to only have wine and beer available for purchase-- no margaritas with your food.,"It's clear to me that Joanne the Scammer runs this place. I ordered lunch off Uber Eats and was shocked when my order arrived.I ordered what I BELIEVED to be chips and guacamole. If you take a look at my photos, it was a crap ton of chips and ONE SINGLE 2 OUNCE cup of guacamole. 2 OUNCE SOLO CUP. The description on Uber Eats read ""Homemade guacamole and salsa"". I was expecting a sizable amount of guacamole to accompany the 67,000 chips they sent.I just knew something had to be wrong so I called Don Swindle about the guacamole swindle. According to the woman I spoke with, this is just what it is. *Kanye shrug* I asked her if there was another variation of chips & guac I could have ordered that would have gotten me an equal ratio of the two and she answered no. I'll stick to ordering from hole in the wall, authentic Mexican joints in Jamaica that will send you a tub full of guacamole. LOS ALMUERZOS MEXICANOS at 138-21 Jamaica Ave. Order from these folks if you want Mexican.I will never order or eat at Don Nico's again. Avocados ain't that expensive. They can run this racket on someone else.","It's clear to me that JOANNE THE SCAMMER runs this place because ROBBERY AND FRAUD is what goes down here. Today, I ordered lunch off Uber Eats and was SHOCKED when my order arrived.I ordered what I BELIEVED to be chips and guacamole. If you take a look at my photos, I received a crapload of chips and ONE SINGLE 2 OUNCE cup of guacamole. 2 OUNCE SOLO CUP! Basically, a shot of guacamole. The description on Uber Eats read ""Homemade guacamole and salsa"". I was expecting a SIZABLE amount of both, specifically the guacamole, to accompany the 670,000 chips they sent. I just knew something had to be wrong so I called DON SCAMMERS about GuacamoleGate.

My gripe didn't seem to phase this lady AT ALL.I'll stick to ordering from smaller, authentic Mexican joints in Jamaica that will send you a tub full of guacamole. Enough leftover to smear on yourself for fun even!I should have known better though. I ate here once before and customer service was subpar. TRASH. They screwed up the order and offered nothing in return for their error. 2 weeks ago I wanted to order takeout around 7-8pm. I checked with GrubHub & Seamless and the restaurant was listed as closed. Odd. I called and asked if they were open and they said yes. I asked if they delivered and was told it depends on where I was located. I didn't even bother ordering with them that night. It shouldn't be that much trouble to order some food. I order sushi from a spot in Briarwood every other weekend past 9pm and don't encounter these issues/questions.Avocados ain't that expensive. But this racket y'all are trying to run? RUN IT ON SOMEONE ELSE because I will not be back.","Pros: Food was good, nice presentation, authentic Mexican ambiance, nice decor, convenient location Cons: Service wasn't very welcomingOverall: Nice place","It is so difficult to find good yet semi healthy lunch spot in Jamaica but I've finally found one in Don Nico's! Food here is tasty and the ambiance of the restaurant makes it worthwhile to stay instead of always grabbing to go - as I'm use to doing at other restaurants in the area. I usually order a platter which comes with your choice of protein, rice and beans and a side of tortillas. It's the best bang for your buck as it usually lasts me at least two meals My only criticism is that it takes forever to get your food. Understandable though because it's usually packed during lunchtime. I'd recommend you call ahead or order online, even if you are planning on eating there.",Found this place within feet from my job. In this area is not much decent food options. Just alot of fast food options that I cannot have since Ive stopped eating meat.I ordered the Shrimp Tacos that comes with Grilled Onion and Peppers. I got a side of fries although it is expensive for side to be sold for $6. I wouldnt do that again- although the fries were pretty good. The shrimp tacos are delicious and freshly made to order and aren't baby shrimps either. The tacos are great with their house guacamole. I would definitely come here again but once in a while as a treat because its a bit pricey.,Don Nico's
589,"I was looking forward to finding a great place in the neighborhood that I could regularly stop in for a decent meal on weekdays. Unfortunately I left disappointed and later a bit infuriated. Starting with the food, I ordered the prosciutto and pickles to start with the short rib and polenta for the main. Although the restaurant was almost empty it didnt stop the servers from rushing me out the establishment. Both my short rib and prosciutto plate arrived the same time, ok cool they're in a rush. However, the short rib was luke warm, lacked salt, and the polenta was watery with no texture and minimal flavor. Ok maybe they had a bad day I would normally give them another try. What was upsetting and why I will not give them another try is the service. The staff was not remotely friendly and seemed like their main aim was to get me in and out very quickly. I came to the restaurant around 6:30, which is happy hour for drinks until 7. Throughout the course of the meal (which lasted 50min) I had two drinks. When I received my check at 7:20, I noticed only one drink was HH. I asked the waiter if the second should be on the HH price he said no its after 7. Again, irritating but I'm completely fine with that it's their policy. What made me upset is when the waiter swiped my card he included gratuity as if I would not have paid him for his service. I have rarely been treated with such disrespect  at a restaurant and will not being going back, I'd  advise others to do the same.",Incredible Italian food with an equally cool interior.,"I can't speak for the food because we didn't even get to sit down, but I can say the service is the absolute worst I have ever encountered. And that's saying a lot, not even in 3rd world countries is service so unprofessional. We arrived around 8:20pm. The hostess told us it would be a 15/20 minute wait. Being a Friday night, it's normal that there wouldn't be an open table, and after a minute of deliberation, we decided to stay. Soon after, hordes of people began arriving, and waitress asked us to confirm if we were staying, I said yes. I even asked to view a menu while we waited. The waiting space is tiny, practically non existent, but nonetheless we waited patiently. Please note that given the tiny space, the hostess could see us standing there. She even smiled at a us a few times while we waited. I noticed a few people who arrived after us were shown to a table immediately. I let it slide, figuring that they had reservations. Then, about 25 minutes of waiting, I asked the hostess how much longer for a table. She acted surprised we were waiting for a table, and said she thought we were leaving! When she specifically asked if we we would wait, we said yes, and we waited for 25 minutes right in front of her and she still had the audacity to say she thought we leaving! Who in their right mind would think we were leaving when I asked for a menu and then waited for 25 minutes?At this point, we were visibly upset, waiting around for 25 minutes like idiots, while she had shown people that arrived after us a table. Never in my life did I imagine a restaurant with such high reviews to have such an incompetent hostess.Edit in response to the owner:When you asked to confirm if we staying, neither of us said ""no."" We both said yes. That is why I asked to view the menu! Who would ask to see the menu if they were not staying?!?! Better yet, who would wait in a tiny space if they were not staying?!?! Don't worry, after the terrible service, we have no intentions of coming back.","I love this place, I've come here with co-workers, friends, my wife, family-- it seems to work for every occasion.  It's a nice atmosphere, warm and cozy.  The food is fantastic-- I love the arancini balls which they only serve during the week. I wish they would have it on weekends too. It's definitely a must try.  All the pastas are good, I have worked my through their menu and they're all unique in their own way.  In general I've yet to have one bad meal here.As far as deserts go, the donut holes with chocolate or the olive cake are exceptional.","Best happy hour in Greenpoint. Okay, second best after El Born. They give you a choice of their most popular appetizers for ridiculously cheap and in addition to discounts on wine and beer, they have a few cocktail specials for only 8$. I dont remember the bartenders name, but he's always there and he makes an excellent four roses manhattan in addition to the rest. I also strongly recommend the Oaxacan, wow.For food it is hard to go wrong. The meatballs, calamari, burrata, and any pasta. My suggestion if you wanna save a few clams while eating some is hit the bar for the apps and a few drinks then share a main dish from the regular menu. You will be full, happy, and not quite broke.","Great place!! The inside is beautiful, food is good! If you get a chance, get the beer! It's so good!",Naked Dog
590,I come here to meet a friend for lunch.  The foods are great here. They are in good portions.  The service is great until the end.  I ask the short red hair female server for separate checks for me and my friend. She manages to mess it up not only once but twice.   She  is giving negative attitude and blames me for her faults. I never have to gone a place that a sever is being incompetent o doing their jobs correctly.,"General Tso's Chicken.... you would've never have guessed it is made of tofu unless someone told ya....so in a nutshell, 10 out of 10, would do it again.",Please don't go there. The most disgusting food I ever had in my life. No joke. The worst. I had to leave and go get pizza.,"Veg meat pastry - good, flaky outside like cha siu sou. Pan fried veg bun - not bad. Buddha rice roll - okay, but my friend loved it. Pan fried dumplings - pretty good. Veg roast meat fried rice - best dish of the day, in my opinion. Mapo tofu - just okay, it wasn't that spicy. And probably too many mushrooms for me. Came on a day when they were making moon cakes and so we had to have them. We got both flavors: pineapple and lotus. Possibly the best moon cakes I've ever had and they were vegan! We also got the mango pudding for dessert, which was huge and delicious with extra cream, which they said was also vegan.",Went here a couple of times with my friends and their sesame chicken and fried rice is amazing! They immediately serve you tea when you're seated! The soy bean chicken tastes like REAL CHICKEN! The environment is really calm and I live coming here!,"This is honestly a hidden gem. If you want to enjoy Chinese food to the fullest as a vegetarian, come here! There are so many options from meat to seafood dishes. This was my third time here and I wanted to share this experience with you all considering how good this place is. Food: Everything was flavorful and tasty, except for the  pan-fried meat bun. It was okay, but it definitely needs an extra ingredient like soy sauce. The highlight dish for me was the chicken with broccoli. It was so good and it tasted just like chicken even though I've been vegetarian for four years already! The chicken was so crispy on the outside - I'm honestly very impressed. Everything else tasted great. Portion sizes were very reasonable as well. Service: Comparable to other Chinese restaurants. Food didn't take too long to prepare. Ambiance: Inside is clean and well-lit. The walls are decorated with Asian art. Price: It's a little more expensive compared to traditional Chinese restaurants, but it's highly reasonable considering the amount of skills necessary to produce those tasty imitation flavors using vegetetarian ingredients. I'd say it's highly worth it!Overall, this is an awesome place for vegetarians to get tasty imitation meat and seafood dishes! I will definitely be back to try out other things on their menu!",Bodai Vegetarian
591,"I actually do reviews on that day but that time I was lazy. Last week I decided to do a take out from joong koog jip.I been coming to this place for years when I used to live around that area I did a take out and dine in almost twice in a week. Now that I moved to city area it's hard for me travel all the way to flushing. I heard that it's not the same owners as before but I still gave them a try. Unfortunately this will be my last trip because due to what I ordered and what I experienced with the food was terrible! I ordered very spicy noodles soup, black bean noodles and spicy fried chicken over rice.From those three dishes the only thing that was good were the black bean noodles. The rest was terrible. The two dishes weren't spicy! When it's suppose to be spicy! No second chance not returning again.",Okay staff and diverse set of menu Conveniently located Food is mediocre. Not bad but nothing special Ingredients are not fresh Had seafood based noodle and tangsuyuk 2 of us got sick right after the meal,"Ohyang Jangyook are you kidding me? $20.95 ""dish"" and this is what I get...Dining in and getting it to-go is the same price so I expect the same dish.I would not pay 20+ tax to eat cucumbers...Such a shame I'm here so often","There's a lot of Korean-Chinese food restaurants around NYC, but Joong Koog Jip is by far the most consistent and my favorite! Their jajangmyeon is obviously good, but for lunch today I got the beef fried rice and my mom got the japchae bap. The fried rice here is my favorite because they actually use fresh ingredients unlike a lot of other restaurants that use frozen vegetables out of a bag.Order:- Beef fried rice (5/5) ~ the portion size is huge- Japchae bap (5/5) ~ loaded with green and red bell peppersPros:- Always consistent - Food is tasty - Portion size is HUGE - Menu is large so you have a lot of options Cons:- Kinda hard to get to without a car, although there is a bus that stops right outside - Parking is terrible around this area Overall:- If you're looking for good Korean-Chinese food, I definitely recommend this place!","Great place for jajangmyun! The noodles are so smooth and the bits of onion give it a nice bite.I personally don't enjoy the jjamppong as much. There's a rich shrimp flavor in the broth, but it's a tad too salty for me. The dealbreaker is that each time I've had it, the noodles are on the soft end. Since they're the same as those in the jajangmyun, they probably need to be cooked less.The beef tangsooyuk is a crispy, sweet treat. It's best eaten immediately because I've found it gets soggy once left out or packaged to go.","If in Queens go to Joong Koog Jip for Jjajangmyun!  Came here for the first time during my visit to Queens and was pleasantly surprised.   We got the Jjajangmyun and tangsuyuk (pork).  They put the sauce on the side for the tangsuyuk so the meat stays nice and crispy.  The Jjajangmyun sauce was flavorful and did not have an over-bearing MSG taste like some of the other noodle houses.Service was very fast, I think it took at most 10 minutes to get our meal out.  For a weekend, tables were being turned around fast, more and more people kept coming in.  You know this place is a go-to for a lot of people.The fried donut bites at the end were the cherry on top for this meal!",Joong Koog Jip
592,"The worst! Sorry to be so disappointed because I had high hopes. Ordered the veggie burger. First thing, we walked in and ordered take out. After waiting 30 mins, checked on status and they seemed to have forgot. In the next 5 mins the order was ready, which seemed odd. Walked home which was 1 mile away from this place and opened my takeout box. I was in disbelief. They actually just threw rice and beans on a bun and called it a veggie burger! There was 0 cooking done to bind this together. Do not waste your time going here.","The bartenders bring some rude gay guys, that are bashing the females just cause there friend is going out with an ugly short bartender, and thinks that every female wants him,, yuck!!,,please don't go here, these people are sooo rudeeee!!!!!!",This solely based on the drinks. Haven't tried the food. The bartenders are pretty cool. They have drink specials. It's close to work. But I absolutely despise the long walk. I'll be back doing one too many fireball shots.Password: wildgoats,"Is there a bigger Irish pub than Passage in Astoria? Me thinks not. From the outside looking in, the place doesn't seem all that spacious. Walk through the door and there is a whole load of craziness that includes a massive bar, a back area worthy of its own private party, and plenty of booths for groups and couples alike. Cozy, yet inviting, and with plenty of breathing room. This is the kind of joint where I'd throw a party for myself and all of my friends.One of the things they do exceptionally well, is serve some quality drinks. Since their predecessor, they've done a great job of introducing a fun line up of cocktails. I am a fan of their Passage Mule and when the weather is a bit too hot, their frozen Irish coffee is clutch with the caffeine and the brain freeze.No Irish pub is complete without a good set of taps, especially of the beer kind. They have a nice selection of beers on tap, with some craft in the mix as well. I don't mind me a pint of Guinness every so often. If I'm in the right mood (which I usually am at Passage) I'll down it all.An area that I'm really impressed with Passage in is on the food front. They have quite the beefed up (#1) menu with a number of traditional Irish items and a loaded selection of pub fare. The food gets more press than the drinks do, which is frankly no surprise. In no particular order I recommend:* Fish and Chips* Jameson Spring Rolls* Passage Burger* Guinness Mac and Cheese* Irish Stew* Sunday RoastThere is never a bad time to come here. They have a fun brunch hour on the weekends, a cool happy hour on the week days, and the staff is always accommodating. I'll surely be back often (and hungry / thirsty).___________(#1) Pun intended.","Was meeting up with a friend in Astoria.We hopped on the yellow line subway to make the trek from Times Square. Once off the subway, just a stroll a few blocks away. We had considered Wolfhound with the live Irish tunes, but it was packed and standing room only.Thank goodness our friend recommended this bar. Friendly Irish bartenders who are good to look at. Space so that you aren't pressed up against others and noise level was not too loud, meaning you could still hear one another and have a conversation. There's a kitchen, but I didn't try any of the food. Open late, so you can keep the night going. Recommend.","I would highly, highly recommend this bar if you are planning any party. I worked with Ursula from start to finish for planning my husband's 40th birthday roast and it has been an absolute dream working with her. I mean, I just wrapped up the party this morning at 2AM, and I had to write this review to share my glowing experience with this bar to show my utmost appreciation. From planning the menu (with her beautiful, bonus menu cards with my husband's face on them, wuhoo!) to the very organized flow of the party - drinks kept a'coming `cos Ursula is a superwoman), organized buffet line, frickin' fabulous food (you HAVE to get the traditional Irish stew if you're here, delicious!), gorgeous rustic, beautifully lit venue to boot - really, what more can you ask for?Their party packages are definitely worth the value, they don't scrimp on ANYTHING, and the service you will get throughout your whole party from planning to execution is top-notch. You can even play your own music if you rent the back room. Planning a party is not always easy, but this place made it super breezy! Thank you for everything, Ursula, the party was a huge success thanks to you. You are the bomb.com, yayyy!!!In conclusion, for all of your party needs, or hey, if you're in the neighborhood and just want an incredible meal, Passage is always a great choice!",Passage Irish Bar and Kitchen
593,"It was a pleasant surpirse to gind this hidden gem. Never had Taiwanese brunch so I was very excited.Food was okay. It was little busy so everything took little longer than usual but it was toally understandable. However, if the food took longer than usual, it should have executed properly. Our danzi mian came with undercooked shrimp. The server looked at it and he was busy hiding it when he was clearing our table. I did not say anything because I knew he would not care.About the service, let me tell you something Eric. I have worked as a server for many years. I know that taking orders from a table of six with no background knowledge about Taiwanese brunch can be very stressful. However, it can not an excuse to treat us like trash. If you knew that we were waiting for good 10 minutes to place in our orders, you should have understand our frustration too. But you just decided to not greet us at all and seemed busy writting down our orders so you can rush to POS to put in the orders for the big table, our table, and the table next to us. You tuined our experience. Thank you.","I've been here three times and it slowly gets worse and worse every time. The food is delicious which is why I keep coming back, but the customer service is severely lacking. The hostess is not friendly whatsoever. Acted like I ruined her day when I asked for a table. The worst was my server. Short blonde haired girl. Came to the table 10 minutes after we were seated and said ""what do you want?"" There was no ""how are you"" ""have you been here before"" ""Can I start you with something to drink"". Super unfriendly. Never came back to our table to check on us or ask if we wanted another round of drinks, which we would have if she had been more attentive. It's a shame because I really like the food, but I just can't get over the rude customer service.","This is the best Taiwanese restaurant in New York, but the owners are confused about the heritage and cultural identity of the restaurant.The food here is great. I love the lu rou fan, beef roll, zhajiangmian, and pretty much everything on the menu. It is the only place I know of that serves stinky tofu within 30 mins of Manhattan. In fact, it's one of three full service Taiwanese restaurants around Manhattan. The cocktails are an exciting fusion of Asian herbs and western liquor. The decor here is modern Scandinavian crossed with Brooklyn hipster.What's missing is a feeling of Taiwan. Food is a HUGE part of Asian culture and it is very evident in Taiwanese daily life. From the night markets to the 7-Elevens, there is amazing food on every street corner and every block. Sadly, the only connection to Taiwan is the Chinese characters on the cans of Taiwan Beer.The restaurant opted to dumb down Taiwanese culture to make American diners comfortable instead of creating a dialog. The menu is completely in English with no Chinese while a lot of meaning is lost in the translation. What in the world is a ""nutritious sandwich""? The waiters and waitresses completely butchered the pronunciation of ""zhajiangmian"" and warned me that the sticky tofu is stinky. (Yeah no shit, that's why I want it). Am I supposed to pronounce the Chinese ""lu rou fan"" with an American accent so the wait staff can understand my order too?Dear white people: When the Asians at the table next to you order stinky tofu, please do make a disgusted face and add a snarky comment about how strange it smells. Your opinion is definitely appreciated.The missing star is for the missing soul of this restaurant.","This is a very solid Taiwanese restaurant. I came on a Sunday night and it was pretty packed. There was already about 10 people waiting outside. They have both inside and outdoor seating, in addition to the bar. The food is very tasty. I ordered the sesame noodles, scallion pancake, and the pork buns. Everything was very fresh and flavorful. The scallion pancake was crispier/crunchier than I'm used to, but still wasn't bad. I would definitely come back if I'm visiting NYC.",Win Som is a brooklyn gem and great for dates and experimenting with unconventional dishes. The drinks here are bomb and the beer is a great pick for first timers. The wait is usually a bit long on a prime day like thurs - sat however worth if it u order a great dish. The fried chicken dish was very messy and a little disappointed.Oh and the music is always good!,"Came here on a Sunday around 11:20am and waited maybe 10 minutes to be seated for 2. They have a small bar at which you can wait and order drinks. We ordered a small iced green tea, which came in this home-brewed canister, large enough to share. It was delightful!For food, we ordered:Tian Dou Jiang (sweet soy milk) - B+O-a Jian (oyster omelette) - A-Sesame Noodles with egg - A-I'm giving them 4 stars for the TASTE of their food alone. However, expect to pay a lot if you like to walk away full, because their portions are much smaller for their prices than in American brunch. Sesame Noodles was a good sized dish (no meat.) Also the Big Chicken and Waffles looked sizable.I probably wouldn't come back for brunch, but still interested in trying their dinner menu!",Win Son
594,"I came here for a company dinner and there were flies everywhere. Throughout the whole breakfast there were about four flies all over us, flying into our food and onto us. It almost seemed unreal and was quite disturbing . Which sucks because this is a beautiful place, with a DOPE bathroom. The staff is friendly and the food is very good and filling. However of that doesn't matter if there's flies everywhere interrupting your meal.","One of the brunch dishes we ordered had a worm crawling in it. We called the waiter over and sent the dish back and cancelled the order for the dish because we felt a bit finicky post incident. We were shaken by the incident but proceeded to not make a big deal about it. I was hoping that the restaurant would make some reparations for the incident and provide a discount of some sort (or a totally free meal) but to my dismay, no such thing happened. I have sneaky feeling that the treatment and service for such an incident would have been handled differently for more Caucasian patrons of this establishment. This review has nothing to do with the food itself, which I find to be quite delicious. I've been here here in three separate occasions  however, I'm disappointed by the level of service offered and how the situation was handled and will not be returning back as a result.",Recommendation:1: Soya Marinated Tuna Tostada2:Tlayuda OxomocoThe tuna really made my day!,"We have eaten at Oxomoco many times but I only just now took photos to give readers a glimpse of the amazing food here. The restaurant has a nice outdoor seating area and a well-decorated interior as well which gives off a very ""hip"" vibe upon entry. The staff is accommodating and friendly which helps tie everything together. We've eaten dinner here before (which was great as well) but I find the Oxomoco brunch experience to be the most enjoyable. Drink wise, you really can't go wrong but we really love the Spicy Mango margarita (don't worry, it's pretty mild) and the Smoked Strawberry. Appetizer wise, we enjoy the guacamole (which comes with large tortilla chips) but recently discovered the Chorizo Tlayuda which has a tortilla base topped with cheese, beans, salsa, and chorizo. Believe it or not, the tlayuda was not as heavy as you'd expect but very delicious. Lastly, we tend to order the Hamburguesa Pambazo, Bacon Burrito, or the Concha Especial. Between the three, the Hamburguesa Pambazo and Concha Especial are the best tasting and most unique in terms of flavor and presentation. The Hamburguesa Pambazo has a salsa macha that adds a nice flavor to the already juicy burger while the Concha Especial creates a wonderful sweet and savory taste by combining the pan dulce (Mexican sweet bread) with chorizo verde. Overall, I highly recommend everyone to grab brunch here ASAP and get a taste of the Oxomoco experience. Oxomoco consistently offers great food, drink, and service. We look forward to coming back again soon!","Located in the heart of greenpoint, this Michelin star restaurant boasts and authentic feel with some delectable eats.I came for brunch and sat on the outdoor patio which was cozy and chique. To start, I tried a few margaritas-both the spicy Mango and mezcal strawberry were excellent, and, very aesthetically pleasing.The tostadas definitely intrigued me. We ended up ordering the tuna and it was, unsurprisingly, savory and delicious.I tried the chilaquiles rojos for my main meal, which I'd definitely recommend. Overall, the service and ambience of Oxomoco is quite pleasing. I definitely would return to taste other brunch menu items, and of course, the renowned tacos. Definitely recommend making a reservation in advance.","My boyfriend is obsessed with Bobby Flay so we were watching the Flay List and this restaraunt was in it. Bobby Flay's daughter recommended it. I come to Greenpoint all the time and walk past this place but never went so we thought to try it.We knew it was going to be expensive so was prepared for that. But we were really disappointed in the food quality for the price. You get two small tacos for $17. In the chicken taco the flavor was good, but I had a huge bone in mine! Good I didn't chomp down or would have lost a tooth. The steak one was very chewy. Also wasn't crazy about the tortilla used, it was too starchy tasting. And The horchata agua fresca was mostly ice. We ordered two desserts. The flan and the chocolate cake. The chocolate cake was definitely better than the flan. The cake was dense and rich, i liked the crunchies on top which added a nice texture with the creamy coffee ice cream. The flan dish was a mess though. It was a rectangle of gelatin. Totally the wrong texture, and it was swimming in a blueberry sauce. That blueberry sauce did not go with the flan or compliment it in anyway. There was supposed to be lemon on it and I tasted no lemon. I just tasted overwellming blueberry jam with gelatin. The corn crisps on the top added a crisp respite to the gelatinous dish but did not compliment it in flavor. The best thing we tried was the $4 smoked mango. My boyfriend loves smokey, spicy things and dried fruit so this was right up his alley. The mango had a nice chewy juicy texture to it and the spices were a nice combo. A bit too spicy for me but he really liked it. Also the bathrooms have disco balls in them. A very wierd experience. Not a fan. So we paid $100 for an icey drink, some dried fruit, bones in tacos, chewy steak and gelatinous dessert. We are okay with spending $40 on tacos but they better be the most amazing tacos we ever had. And they were very far from it. Skip this place and go to los tacos no. 1. Which is my favorite taco place and also coincidently Bobby Flay's pick on the show.",Oxomoco
595,Hamburger was like a mix of soy pattie and meat overcooked.  Blah.  Not something i would order again.,"This has got to be one of the worst Diner type food spots I have ever been. There were about six of us and every single one of us were not happy with our food.First, there's like no options. And the biggest section is probably their burgers. If your burgers take up most of the menu, shouldn't it at least taste decent?You KNOW it's bad when you have to put more salt and pepper on the burger even when you got one of the specialty ones.Burgers were dry af and they need to change the buns. It's also bad when I say my school fries are better than their fries... yikes.Also, our server didn't get our order right and got a french onion soup instead of onion rings.. lol... and then he insists we got the soup. Finally he get's pretty annoyed and throws out the soup..",I don't understand why it has any stars at all it smells like ass in there food is absolutely HORRIBLE the waiters don't like there job and are extremely rude DO NOT EAT OR TRY THIS PLACE OUT ITS TERRIBLE don't waste your time,"You better be hungry if you go for breakfast! We both ordered ~$13 plates, and we ate to skip lunch, and neither of us could finish our orders.  I sampled my wife's farmhouse omelette and it was yummy, as were the potatoes that came with. My Pete's Special had 3-meats, 2-eggs, and 2-MONSTER slices of the fluffiest, delicious french toast I have ever had!  I felt so guilty leaving one behind.  Every other plate I saw go by looked amazing, too, esp. a strawberry & whipped cream waffle. Coffee & ice water always topped up, and entire Spanish-speaking staff were very efficient & friendly. Several vendors & patrons greeted with hugs.  What a great start to your day!","Great food, HUGE selection, quick delivery!Got delivery at least once a day while I was in New York on business, and each time I was more than satisfied. Their selection is so huge and diverse! There's literally something for everyone, and for every meal of the day. And what's best is that it was ALL delicious!",First time at Pete's Grill and I can say that the food is delicious and very attentive service!! I tried the Greek Omelette and it was really good! Would like to repeat soon,Pete's Grill
596,This is our go-to greek restaurant in the area.  The food is always very fresh and the people that work there couldn't be nicer.,"I recently ordered take-out and the chicken appeared slimy and under cooked. I wound up throwing it away. Needless to say, I will never order from this place again. In addition, I was charged too much tax for what I ordered. I could have made a big deal over it, but I didn't. Just be careful when eating here and pay attention to your bill.","Absolutely disgusting place. How they stay in business is mind boggling.  Before you order, take a moment to pause and observe how the food is being prepared. I guarantee you will just walk out...it really feels like you are buying in a community with trash and the street and bums asking for change out front.",My family's recently started visiting this restaurant this year and the falafel is absolutely the best we've had in NYC. This establishment is a solid 5 stars in every respect. One of the best secrets in NYC.,"Finally stoped in to try this lil hidden Greek spot !!!I mean I'm always flying down yellow Stone & I never saw this spot but often smelled good food cooking from their exhaust ....Real nice & clean Lil restaurant with just enough seating & yes they have AC !!! It was very comfortable in there !!!I was greeted with a friendly smile and a warm welcoming....I ordered the beef & lamb gyro plate with fresh cut fries with feta !!! Delish !!! The meat was moist n tender !!!The Lil Greek side salad was on point as well !!!Really enjoyed my meal .... I will definitely be back with my wife & daughter  to explore their menu !!!I would have given them a 3.5 stars but as we all know with yelp no half's .... lol I hope to up their star rating after eating there a few more times ..... Thanks,Greg D.",This place opened up about 2/3 years already. Its Greek food done well and fast. The location is very convenient since I live across the street. I love the gyros that they have. The meat is really good not too dry and their tzatziki sauce is very tasty. I've ordered a lot of different things off the menu to try them out. My favorite are the beef/lamb gyros or the vegetable wrap. Their lemon potatoes are really tasty.They serve a lot of food and for a decent price. I think the owners are really sweet and the staff is really nice. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for a really good tasty home cooked meal that isn't cooked in your house.,Village Grill
597,"If I could have given no stars, I would have. By far the worst meal and service I have ever experienced. The bread was clearly frozen and defrosted, it was stale and freezer burned. The calamari we ordered arrived cold and only contained about 10 rings. We asked for our pasta al denti, it was extremely over cooked and swimming in bland sauce. Our pasta did not arrive with the salads it was supposed to, when we asked the waitress..her response was, ""I just take the orders"".  I ordered cookies which were also clearly frozen and defrosted, they were soft and disgusting.Completely disgusting meal, avoid this place at all costs.","From the outside you will think this place is not good but is the total opposite. Inside is nothing fancy but the restaurant in general is very cozy, service is good, full bar, different wine choices and can't forget the food. Authentic Italian mom and pops style, fresh pasta made on site, good portion and good flavors. Nice place to be romantic and spend some time with good company. Is a must try if you are in the neighborhood.","Best Greek period and exclamation point.Friendly service with a neighborhood feel.The salads are fresh.  The meats, chicken and fish Devine.  The lemon potatoes are to die for and the desserts will kill you.","I first heard of this from the many mentions of this restaurant on Zagat. I finally went with a few friends and we were all happy with our dinner. The restaurant has been open for 41 years and it was like a well oiled machine. The decor was really nice, the outside doesn't really have the most appealing storefront but don't let the outside deter you from visiting. Also, the service here was friendly and top notch, thank you for all the stories.The food:Octopus and Asparagus Special- Omg was the octopus excellent, the octopus was super tender and I loved the garlic flavor. The portion was a tad small but the dish had so much flavor and the asparagus was cooked nicely. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Eggplant Rollettini- The was good, it was nice and tender eggplant and the cheese had good flavor and added a nice chew but I did wish the sauce had some more flavor. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Steak Pizzaiola- This was easily my fav item of the night. I loved the steak and the tomatoes, this was kinda a surprise because I wouldn't normally associate steak with tomatoes but it went together perfectly. The tomatoes were so perfectly sweet. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Salmon- The salmon was so tender, so light and packed so much flavor. I enjoyed the tomatoes, capers and garlic, as well. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Roast Suckling Pig Special- I enjoyed the flavor on this but I did wish there was some kind of texture on the skin since it wasn't soft. Overall, it was good but it would have been amazing if the skin was crunchy. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Scallop Pasta- This was the dish I thought was going to be the easy favorite but turned out to be my least favorite. I enjoyed the scallops since they were nice and fresh but the pasta came off very bland to me. I also thought the pasta come off on the heavy side. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Broccoli Rabe- The waiter asked if we wanted rabe and cabbage for the table and wow were they both really good, the rabe was not too bitter and it was perfectly tender.Cabbage- This was really good, it was nice and sweet with really good flavor. Italian Cheesecake- I thought the cheesecake was just OK, I thought it could use some better texture and I thought it came off dry.Cannoli- I thought the cannoli was just OK, the shell could have been fresher.","Was recommended to try Manducatis from a colleague whose wife used to work here and was very happy we finally checked it out after living in LIC for 3 years!We had walked past outside many times, but there were surprised to find out there are three dining rooms, and the owner has worked there for over 63 years! He told us stories about every room being packed in the past every night. We came on a Wednesday night, so we were quickly seated and served. Might be past its glory days but still a nice place and we'll be returning. Comfort Italian with large portions of homemade noodles. Would love to come back when they have the homemade wine from Italy!",Wow this place has been around LIC even before LIC became what it is now. Everything is great. And freshly made in the restaurant. The space is huge. Would recommend here to try,Manducatis
598,"For lunch, I get the 2 roll special. For dinner, I get the 3 roll special.Decent sized pieces of fish in the rolls. Never had an issue with the freshness of the fish.Removed a star because they lack an online ordering system. Also, there is a $10 CC minimum, so I have to pay in cash for the lunch order, since the total is slightly under $9.",I ordered steak teriyaki (medium) and it was rare I don't even think they cooked it honestly. I couldn't eat it and I spent over $45 dollars on my meal,"Just ordered delivery, I ordered pepper white tuna but they delivered me pepper tuna(the red kind), I'm pretty sure I said ""white""quite clearly because I'm afraid this would happen and it actually did, I'm pissed because I only eat white tuna.And the delivery guy I don't know what's his problem , he misread the total amount on the receipt and thought we didn't give the right amount and being so rude.",My all time favorite Japanese restaurant.  Good is always delicious and reliable. Never have I been disappointed with the food or service. Restaurant is always clean. Delivery is fast! Feels like I just place an order and my doorbell rings!,"My go to place when I'm in the mood for sushi or ramen. My sister & I love their poke bowls and their maspeth rollIs my dads favorite, it's amazing. The ramen in soup is delicious as well, the food here is great and the service is quick ! Always a good experience","Really delish!  Ordered delivery for 6 people and everything was correct and on time.  The teriyaki beef was really good quality meat, cooked correctly medium as ordered.  The teriyaki chicken was also really good and the portion size was huge.  They both came with sticky rice and a choice of miso soup or a little side salad.  The spicy tuna roll was also good.  Would order again!",Sakura 7
599,This was a horrible restaurant and I would not return back for a second visit. The waitstaff took over 10 minutes to a knowledge us and our table. It Leaves a horrible impression when you have to wait for the waitstaff to figure out the tables. Our waiter even told us that he wasn't really our waiter until he asked. The bread plate was bright out with food on it. The food was cold also we asked for our check because we were in hurry to get to an appointment and the waiter seemed disappointed that we were not adding dessert and coffee on the bill. The thing that turned me off the most was when we paid our bill the waiter clearly mentioned that they would prefer a cash tip since we paid by card. I just thought that was rude and tacky. Will not return to this establishment anytime soon.,"This actually was my favorite restaurant in bayside due to their beautiful outdoor brunch area, the food & their exquisite service.NOT ANYMORE.As usual, I ordered my grilled calamari salad to go. When I arrived at my office to eat my lunch, I opened the bag and pulled one of the paper bags out and there was: CHEWED GUM stuck onto two of the paper bags.GROSSI immediately called the restaurant and asked for a manager. Once I told him what I had found, his response was- okay but how's the salad?...... I hadn't even opened the salad yet and obviously by the lack of cleanliness of their packaging, how could I trust that their food won't have chewed gum inside as well?When I told him I haven't even had a chance to open the food yet, he replied with: okay well open the salad and give me a call back if there's anything wrong w the food. Sorry about that.Literally I got off the phone feeling even worse than I did when I found the gum on my bags. I threw away my salad because overall that's disgusting and will never be returning here, not only because of the gum but because of the rude ass manager.","Service should have been better for dinner after all the times we've been here for brunch. Very disappointed with a rude wait staff. When we paid the bill, the waiter chased after us out of the restaurant suggesting that we did not tip enough. Very unprofessional and unbecoming of a restaurant with a good reputation. Be careful.","I really like this place. The service was a little slow, but it was very busy.The food was abundant and satisfying and also very tasty. Me and my party of four tried a bunch of different menu items and got to share everything with one another leading to everybody enjoying all of our selections.Great Decour with really huge windows and vegetation, plant life, and it's overall pretty quiet to the exception of family screaming and taking pictures with each other.I recommend this place because it's conveniently located with tasty food great service next to core in ample street parking.","Ehhh OK! Thats what I would say to sum up my experience. You can tell the place needs some TLC since its been open awhile but the food was good (appetizers especially - zucchini chips and dips are a MUST!). I got the Branzino and it was OK but a lot of $$ - portion was good. My husband got the scallops and vegetable risotto and he loved it. Also, there was an event going on inside - seems like a great venue for a bridal/baby shower or birthday party!","I came here for a bridal shower brunch! They reserved a nook inside for one table and there longer tables in the main area for the guests. It was out in the open where everyone could see the party, but we kind of had our own space to hang out and take photos. We had a pre-set menu, which included coffee or cocktails, appetizers for everyone to share, an entree for everyone, and Napoleon cake. Of the appetizers, there was one dish of zucchini chips that were to die for - and they weren't fried, so I went to town! I ordered the grilled chicken salad, which was enough to take home, but it wasn't something I particularly enjoyed. The chicken was great and plentiful, but the salad part was super greasy. Other people got entrees like the omelette and French toast, which they seemed to enjoy. I really liked the coffee with their almond milk!The service was very professional and attentive. Whatever we needed, they were quick to provide. Thy handled the big party well. However, one thing to be cautious about is the valet parking: it wasn't even that full inside, but they had no more space for my car. So arrive early to make sure they got you. It's a great space for small events like showers and birthdays!",Veranda Restaurant & Cafe
600,Ole Mexican grille is a big hit. I tried the quesadilla and the churros the  experience that I had at this restaurant was amazing. So when you are looking for a place to eat look no further then Ole Mexican Gille.,"Meh. Better off going to a rinky dinky hole in the wall place on the blvd. I tried calling here to place a order on memorial day but i guess they were closed. Which wasnt specified on yelp or google. I went the other day for tacos, they didnt have shrimp. They didnt have corn tortilla. I asked for corn torilla and the kid working pointed to the hard shell and said ""thats corn"" loooooooolllll. Another thin noted, all the workers are young kids working at a glacial pace.  The prices are comparable to chipotle i guess but not so much the flavor. I got a pulled pork, chicken and beef taco. They were good but definitely was missing some salt. The chips and guac were useless stale chips and the guac tasted watered down tbh","I love the food here, but the way the short Hispanic guy treats me and my family every time we come in it's just disgusting. There have been times he just drops the dressings at  the counter with attitude and raises his voice to us. Next time I'm taking my business somewhere else.","Saw some great reviews for this place so figured I'd try it out. I will say that i feel this is more of a 3.5 star review but 4 seemed too generous. Cheap and good usually don't go hand and hand in 2019 especially in any of the boroughs but this place pulls it off. The food was good and the prices were low. Steak Burrito: 3/5, this thing was big enough to cure world hunger, and it tasted pretty good. Unfortunately it was probably 60% rice, but I really can't complain for the price. If there was less rice even if it made sacrificing the size of he Burrito I'd say it'd be better.Chicken Quesadilla: 3/5, alittle bland. Some sauce would've made a world of difference. Nothing to write home about but not bad either.Chips: 4/5, the chips were very good and they give you a full takeout box full. The guac wasn't great though. Needed some more flavor.Overall, I appreciate low cost food without really taking a hit on quality. I really don't want to complain much because the food was good, but it just wasn't anything special and I wouldn't travel out of my way to come back. If I'm ever in the area again, and the urge for mexican strikes I would return.","On our way to MacNeil Park down in College Point by the Long Island Sound, we stopped to get an early dinner. It's a great location, right on 14th Avenue, in the point of the triangle with 15th. We got there around 5 on Sunday. The store is very clean, and bright. The man who helped us (I wish I had his name) was very friendly, and helpful. I got a burrito bowl in a taco shell, with cilantro rice and black beans, pulled pork, and various toppings; I opted for the green sauce (medium heat). The entire dish was delicious, and big: I actually didn't finish it, which is saying something. Laura got two tacos, which she also raved about.     Super! Great good, great service, great value. It has become a go-to place for us. We live in Flushing, and love Mexican food. I highly recommend it.","My fish taco bowl was on point...and huge! Topped with 2 nice sized pieces of fried tilapia and accompanied by some mango salsa, this bowl was full of color, textures, temperatures, and flavors. The tilapia was mild and fried just right (at least for my liking) and all the ingredients complimented one another and were fresh. It all tasted really good and it definitely knocked out my appetite. My son enjoyed his chicken quesadilla and the side of chips & salsa was plentiful as well. Overall, the pricing was not bad at all either.The staff were friendly. The seating is limited but we scored seats by the window. Parking is not easy but that's on par for this area.",Ole Mexican Grille
601,"I will never ever going back there.I would give them 0 star if I could. I was fooled! I ordered matcha azuki bean. love azuki bean paste but don't like ice cream. So I asked them if they can double the bean paste instead of excluding the ice cream. They said yes and I paid the regular price. Well, I was confused when I saw a staff placed a prepared crepe on a pan and reheated it instead pouring crepe mix on a pan but I was busy checking my phone.(They brought a fully cooked crepe from back of the kitchen though their pans are in the front so I am sure it was prepared one.) Anyhow, after a couple of minute, the girl in the counter called me and said "" Here's your crepe with the doubled up azuki bean paste"". So I thought except the suspicious reheated crepe, nothing was wrong. I didn't want to make any problem so I went home with it. At home....I felt something was wrong. So I unwrapped it. There was almost no azuki bean paste in the crepe. Fooled. If that was the doubled up portion, how's the regular portion? One micro bean? Why I had to pay the regular price for ""no ice cream+few pieces of azuki beans+ reheated crepe""?I don't recommend this location. I don't like people who lie to their customers.","I've always come here for the Chocolate Nut party and I have no complaints. I ask them to split it in 2 so it's pretty much 2 smaller versions of the Crêpe which is great for sharing.But when I ordered the Fruits Cocktail and asked them to split it in 2 and the guy ran up to the girl mid order and said in a foreign language that they won't do it. They said they would have to use too much fruit if they split it, which makes no sense bc I didn't ask for extra fruit. They're just were too cheap to add enough fruit to make the crepe look full. The employees were very nice and accommodating when they had first opened but now they're very rude. I guess they're making enough money and don't care about their customers.",The flushing location i feel like is getting bad over time. Every time they put less fruits. If you ever go to the forest hills location you will not the difference. I feel like in flushing they are counting the berries and fruits they put on every crepe. Not cool!,"Had a great crepe! Omg it was so rich and delicious. And huge! Definitely worth the money since it was 7.50 before I added ice cream. I ordered the chocolate banana crepe. It has more extras in it than the banana chocolate one, though that sounded good too. So many sounded good. But banana and chocolate is a winning combination. Because I had my daughter with me I added chocolate ice cream. Omg it was so rich. It was a nice size scoop and I think she said it was 2.50 to add ice cream that's not terrible. Would one million percent come back and 10/10 recommended. My friend loved hers too. It had raisins and Fuji apple and caramel. So good   They have savory crepes too. Some sounded really interesting. If I was near by for lunch I'd probably give one a go. Small location. Very limited seating. But you're in and out so fast it doesn't matter. This is definitely not some place to go and hang out for a while.",Pastry shop with minimal seating/waiting area but don't mind the inconvenience since your order is made fresh in front of you. There are many choices to select from and each item can be customized to your preference. They offer mostly crepes and eggettes and their crepes are crispy and flaky without being soggy like some other places. Some of my kids enjoy their savory crepes almost as much as their sweet dessert crepes. Try their fruit juices (without sugar)if you want to avoid carbs. Look forward to trying the other fruit crepes!,"We went here after Kiss Fish so, we weren't really hungry. But looking at their menu made me want to take a bite if everything they have.  We decided on the Caramel Fuji Apple Crepe. It was heaven. We got a Thai iced tea and it was really good too.  I look forward to coming back to try a savory crepe and definitely will be trying their sweet treats.",T-Swirl Crêpe
602,"The food here is usually decent. But I'm sooo tired of getting this crap for black pudding. We used to travel for this and more than a handful of times lately, it taste like there is NO seasoning in here and rice is soggy!! Do you not taste your food before it's put out or follow a recipe??",sooo inconvenient when you travel an hr and they don't have shrimp roti yet it's on their menu. Street parking is available. No restroom.,Found a piece of plastic in my peanut punch. Please be careful if you are feeding your children this or yourself. Pour it in a glass first because apparently these lazy/careless workers here make dirty peanut punches. NEVER AGAIN.,"You'll realize how much of a gem Sybil's is once you walk in and order something, anything in here! I ordered doubles and ugh, they were SO. DAMN. GOOD. The level of spice and seasoning were on point. I would've loved to have another one, but my stomach and PANTS did not have room for an extra. Space-wise, there's a couple of seats near the window for people to eat in. Whether you're eating in or waiting for your food to go, you'll be jamming to some soca / reggae / dancehall music. You can never go wrong with this place and I'll be coming back to try out more things from their menu!","OMGTalking about a Caribbean party in your mouth. If u love spicy, but not burning your tongue spicy then this place is for u. The food is delish...the food is delish...did I say the food is delish. I've had Guyanese food before but Sybils in Queens is the best I've tested so far. The cocktail chicken patties make u wanna holla n then slap your mother. Please dont slap your mother but the fresh flaky patties with the chicken inside is delightful. They have almost everything u can think of from chicken, beef and goat roti's, to pasta dishes, rice n peas, curry chicken and shrimp. The portions were more then enough at the right price. The only thing I hoped for was a place to sit n enjoy my meal, but its obvious it's a take out restaurant and it is totally worth it.","I mainly go to Sybil's for the Jamaican chicken patties which are bomb and fried fish but they have other good dishes too. Their shrimp fried rice, fried chicken, curry chicken and lo mein just to name a few are also tasty. There is a closer location to my neighborhood called Island Express. Both are good and worth the drive.",Sybil's Bakery and Restaurant
603,"Fraud calling ""anchovy noodle soup"" as such because there is absolutely no anchovies in there. No fish in sight. Only vegetable soup. When asked, they said the anchovy is in the soup. What?! The soup had no taste whatsoever. Just chicken broth.",Their chicken noodle soup is delicious. Would give 5-stars if they gave more chicken. The chicken is tender and the soup is tasty not bland. Noodles are handmade because it's quite chewy. Drive in on 163 street because there is no where to park or stop on Northern Blvd.,"The noodles were bomb, great soup and portions but I gotta say, probably one of the most disappointing seafood pancakes I've had in my life, but I'll just skip out on that next time.","Kalguksoo heaven!I love the kimchi chicken kalguksoo here. The broth is so flavorful and hearty. So much flavor and you can feel the nutrients seeping into your bones as you eat. Highly recommend the noodle soups here along with the bomb seafood pancake. Super crunchy, actually shockingly crunch and packed full of ingredients.I can't wait to come back again.","I come here a decent amount and I love their noodles. Recently I came here to enjoy the cold soy noodles with my friend and they are delicious. They are a summer dish so I try to enjoy them as much as I can in the summer. This store tops it with a tomato slice, an egg, and cucumbers. Also their kimchi is amazing.","I visit this restaurant every single time I visit my parents in NY. I always order the Kimchi Seafood Kalgooksoo and my mom always gets the Chicken Sujaebi. Both are so delicious, no other places makes the kalgooksoo and sujaebi with this perfect texture, it's not mushy or too firm and it's the perfect chewy texture. The broth tastes like it's been boiling for days, it's packed full of flavor. Their simple side dish of napa kimchi and daikon kimchi is the perfect compliment. They have so many other dishes at this restaurant but I can't get myself to order anything else especially on a cold winter day.Can't choose between Kalgooksoo or Sujaebi, order Kaljaebi which is half order of both in the same broth :).",Arirang Restaurant
604,"We just placed our order of lunch.we are getting the lunch special of soup, dumplings,  main course of the spicy basil chicken for my wife.I'm getting the pad Thai with chicken.The veggie soup has very little flavor, other than black pepper, the vegetable dumplings also had little flavor.","Very good foods and service.My wife and I come here often.We usually get pad Thai noodles, the lemongrass soup, and one of the appetizers.","Ate and had takeout here many times over the past 8 years with our recents visits enjoyable. However we ordered $ 100 takeout recently and it was below subpar. Called to discuss our dissatisfaction with the lack of quality and toughness of the entrees ordered. A lame excuse was given ""too busy"" or the food ""sat too long after prep"". Either reason was not acceptable but no consideration was givenSad but true","Great location in Forest Hills right by the other trendy restaurants and, more importantly, delicious food!Came here recently with my wife and a friend on a random Tuesday evening at around 6pm and, since it was a really nice night, the area was already bustling. However, surprisingly Bangkok Cuisine was the one quiet restaurant, with the exception of a few customers. With that said, don't be deterred by the lack of a crowd as it probably has more to do with the fact that they have no outdoor seating unlike the rest of the trendier-looking restaurants on the block.We scored a table by the window and were immediately served by a waitress. Since our friend was the real expert, with multiple trips to the restaurant we left the ordering to her. To be honest, everything sounded good from the menu, but since we were just 3 people, we kept our ordering to a ""modest"" 4 dishes. Here's a quick few thoughts on them:Thai Style Pork BBQ Skewers - The marinated pork skewers were ridiculously delicious and the perfect appetizer. In fact, I could have ordered 3 of these and called it a day. That's how good they were. The skewers were dripping with flavor, very tender and really didn't even need the sweet & spicy dipping sauce on the side. The restaurant could have dropped the mic right there.Chicken Yellow Curry with Thai Roti (served with house salad & steamed rice) - Another excellent dish. The delicious curry had a bit of a kick to it, but there was plenty of chicken to douse the curry with. In addition, there was a small side of steamed rice, so it made for an actually hearty entree.Old Fashion Pad Thai (Chicken) - Solid Pad Thai. It was tasty and, oddly, it was served with sort of an omelette on top, but it worked. I can't say it was any different than most Pad Thai's I've tried in my life, except for the egg-like cover on top.Kao-Obb BKK (special Thai fried rice with shrimp, chicken, scallops & Thai sausage) - Loved everything about this fried rice and its flavors, but I could have used a bit more shrimp and scallops. It seemed more like pieces of fried chicken served with fried rice with a few slices of Thai sausage mixed in. Anyhow, I loved the small pieces of fried chicken and the few slices of Thai sausage were excellent.In addition to the 4 dishes we ordered, we also ordered Thai Iced Teas, but I had to be ""special"" and order the Mango Thai Iced Tea, which I ended up regretting. Not that it was terrible, but there was no milk in it, so it wasn't the best Thai Iced Tea I had. My word of advice, go with the regular Thai Iced Tea if you're thirsty.Service throughout our meal was great. The waitress was cordial and quick to our table to take our food and drink orders and the food arrived right on time when we expected them. Plus, she also came by to re-fill our waters whenever they went empty. Couldn't really ask for a better experience at a local restaurant. Definitely a winner among the many restaurants in the Forest Hills neighborhood.","The lunch special is not only decently priced but good! For the appetizer you can choose either a soup or salad and either the (x2) spring rolls, (x2) vegetable dumplings, or (x2) chicken and shrimp dumplings. You can also choose from a variety of entrees. Some of the dishes, such as the pad thai and pad see ew, you can choose your protein, like tofu, chicken, beef, duck, pork, or shrimp. I opted for the salad, spring rolls, and chicken pad see ew and my mom went the same but chose the shrimp pad thai instead of the pad see ew.Order:- Spring rolls (4/5) ~ Came out quickly and was hot and crispy. Was served with a sweet chili sauce- Salad (4/5) ~ Simple salad with lettuce, and carrots with a dressing that tasted like it had peanuts in it- Chicken Pad See Ew (4/5) ~ Gave a lot of chicken- Shrimp Pad Thai (3/5) ~ Tasted very sweet, but with hot sauce it tasted a lot betterPros:- Tasty Thai food with a variety of food and drinks (they have a full bar)- Clean and nicely designed restaurant - Good and quick service - Great location ~ close to the Forest Hills subway station - Cheap ~ about $10-12 for the lunch special depending on what protein you get - Large portions (especially for a lunch special)Cons:- Small restaurant ~ not ideal for large groups - Pad Thai could have been better. My mom and I both thought it tasted a little too sweetOverall: - I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. Seeing that it only has 3.5 stars on Yelp, I expected the food to not taste that great. The food is actually tasty, and for the lunch special price, it's very worth it. If you find yourself in the area and want some Thai food, Bangkok Cuisine is a great place to visit.","I'm giving Bangkok 3 stars again. This is why:We walked in and were seated immediately. We gazed at the menu for a bit because neither of us wants to eat anything fried, but it seemed like most of the appetizers were. We ordered:Sparkling water $4.5Thai iced coffee $3.50 Fresh soft summer roll $8Steamed mussels $14Authentic Thai dumplings $8Tom yum small soup with shrimp $7Ok so here's the breakdown. The coffee was delicious. The summer roll was the standard Thai summer rolls. The steamed mussels smelled fishy. She also didn't give us a spoon or anything to be able to put the lemongrass sauce on them while we ate. The dumplings I didn't care for at all. The inside was ground beef. I've never had a dumpling like this. I told out server that I didn't like them and she said ""well you ordered them and they are a famous dish"" When actually it was her that suggested them to us. She asked the manager if I could change it to something else. The manager let us do it. I then ordered the Tom Yum soup. It was very small but it was delicious and actually ended up being just enough for my dinner. I don't know if we will go back considering all of the options we have readily at our fingertips.",Bangkok Cuisine
605,"Update: they no longer use intelligentsia coffee which i was sad to find out, but the new devocion coffee ain't bad either. But seriously- BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES. What the hell do they put in these things.","Absolute embarrassment. We bought an entire carrot cake for our teenage nephew's birthday.  Apparently the lady who wrote happy birthday on the cake admitted it was her first time. They chose pink on a white cake. Not a gender neutral color. The lettering is also off centered and looks very sloppy. The cake isn't even fully frosted on the sides. It appears almost unfinished. It's completely ridiculous to pass off a gourmet cake with amateur work. Cake was also dry and over baked. To top it off the business showed complete lack of professionalism. When we called to complain the person on the other line just wrote our name down stating a manger would call back. However, no one ever called. When we followed up a few hours later we were told the manager was not in anymore.","Cosy place to grab coffee in LIC, 5 stars for their cookie!! It was out of this world.","This neighbourhood joint is great. I love working here (when I work from home) and getting a hot cup of coffee or chocolate on a cold winter day. Guess what else is amazing here? Their cookies are TO DIE FOR, and so are their delicious brownies! I love all the baked goods here and would definitely recommend them to everyone who lives around LIC to pay them a visit - you will not be let down (unless they've sold out of cookies and brownies).","For some reason, Hunters Point in Long Island City has a ton of restaurants and bars, but it only has a few options for a quick breakfast. I think this place is easily the best option in the area.The space itself isn't anything too special. They have a few mismatched tables and benches and a sofa arranged in a deep, narrow seating area.  I've never see it too busy, so you can usually grab a stool at a communal table or at the window, even on a weekend.  They have a fair selection of baked goods, which is pretty common for most cafes in the area. The coffee is decent too, but it isn't anything remarkable. The egg sandwiches though are the real reason this spot  is my favorite quick breakfast in the area.  The eggs are covered with a melted cheese sauce, and they offer a few options for toppings--avocado is a personal favorite.  For the area though, I'll agree that it's a little expensive--$29 for two coffees, two sandwiches, and a piece of banana bread! This place is easily one of my favorites in the area. After trying and striking out at a handful of other local bakeries and cafes, I'll gladly return here for quick weekend breakfasts.","51st Bakery and Cafe might actually be my favorite cafe of its kind. I found this bakery on Yelp and thought it'd be a perfect place for lunch because my friend and I had to pick up a Zipcar in the neighborhood. We came on a Saturday afternoon and while the cafe was bustling, there were enough empty seats to sit. We both ordered the frittata sandwich with ham, cheese, spinach, and egg on multigrain bread. It was so delicious and filling! We also ordered a cookie and scone from the bakery options because there were so many delicious goods we couldn't resist. The scone was a little hard, but otherwise very flavorful and certainly a memorable scone. 51st would be a great place to idle, catch up, or do work. There were some people who brought their laptops and others who were just catching up, but the noise level never seemed too bad - free wifi is always a bonus as well. I've come across many many bakeries in NYC and 51st is certainly one of my favorites!",51st Bakery and Cafe
606,Came here on a Saturday morning. waited for about 20 minutes.service was fast.I got the strawberry cheesecake pancakes. My bestfriend got the biscuits with sausage with over easy eggs,"Probably one of the worst IHOP's I have been to it's small, dirty, and the staff are way too slow. I understand sundays can get a little crowded but about an hour wait for three people is unacceptable. The manager seems to accommodate more if you are Spanish. Never again defiantly be sticking to the IHOP in Long Island rather take that drive then come to this dump that's 15 min away from me. Unless you don't mind trash and crappy staff suite yourself.","The brunch burger is my favorite one. We came here couple of times, but the beef is not fresh as before this time. We tried the new one- Italian cannoli, not sweet and tender. (I love their new menu, it makes me so hungry)","I work at an independent living community for seniors and decided to take them to this IHOP. At first it was a bit hectic because I had one person in a wheelchair and everyone else had walkers. This location wasn't big, but the staff did an amazing job accommodating us! I was very impressed at how much patience and care they had for the seniors! They made it possible to fit a resident in a wheelchair as well as 8 people with walkers into there busy establishment. I called a few days before and spoke to the manger Carlos, who did his absolute best to accommodate us. Our waitress ( I forgot her name) did not get frustrated or annoyed by us at all! She made sure we were ok and had everything we needed! The residents could not stop talking about how great the service was!","I love the cheesecake pancake with build your own omelette.Is so much food u will have some left overs.The hubs usually order a platter that has like bacon, sausages and eggs with toast. Coffee is Ok, not the best. Not a big fan of the hot chocolate. Do not order orange juice unless u just want the carton one. The earliest the better. Otherwise you will have to wait for like good 20+minutes.","I was craving a burger and remembered that IHOP is now getting in to the burger craze and plus, I love their pancakes!This restaurant is right on northern blvd and they have their own parking spaces which makes it really convenient. The staff is super nice and accommodating to your preferences. The food comes out all at once and it was pretty quick too. I only wish that they were open 24/7.I like most of the items on their menu.- If you order coffee, they leave a kettle on your table for refills. - They have great hash browns which have a nice crisp on the outside and they give plenty.- Not really a fan of their sausages.- Also not a fan of their scrambled eggs. Pretty sure it's from a carton- The burger was surprisingly much better than I expected. The bun was soft and the patty was juicy. I couldn't decide which burger I wanted either because they all sounded good so I'm sure all of their options would have been good!- The country fried steak was was really good. It came with so many sides - eggs, hash browns and another side which I chose pancakes. - The biscuit with gravy was good as well and came with sausages, eggs, and hash browns. The biscuit was soft and buttery.- Always recommend their pancakes! I love the plain buttermilk pancakes which are not plain at all and super delicious with the original syrup. Although I indulged in such heavy foods which probably had tons of sugar as well, I did enjoy it and would recommend this IHOP. The service was really great and the food was good.",IHOP
607,"Old school in style, Alpha Donuts is A-OK.The doughnuts, which are on par with Dunkin', should satisfy standard doughnut cravings. The coffee, which is sub par to Dunkin', is not recommended.In light of the above, while I'd stop by for a doughnut from time to time, I'd stick to the coffee across the street.","If you're looking for maple bacon ube donuts covered in organic honeycomb glaze, this is not the place for you. There are no trendy flavored donuts or mason jars here. A neighborhood staple, this place serves up no frills diner food and donuts. The decor looks about 50 years old. There's a low countertop and stools where you can get close and personal with the people next to you. The donuts are solid and wholesome, not too sweet or artificial tasting. The coffee is weak but drinkable. While the presentation is lacking, the scrambled eggs and home fries are comforting and tasty. The home fries surprised me, they actually had flavor and were not dry at all (which is why I usually avoid home fries). If you're looking for a down home place to grab some food 24/7 this place is a decent option. Remember, cash only!",Omg..  counter old man is so rude.. I will never go again ; and the donut is not fresh; it is better to grab some donut at food TRUCK,"These donuts are soooooo darn delicious!! The reason for 4 stars is because it's early morning, 10am to be exact and there was some sort of shortage on donuts. Maybe because it does taste great? Seriously like better than Dunkin. I was able to grab one of every kind they had and it was super affordable. The seating area inside is super tiny and crowded so I took my donut to go. The food others were eating smelled amazing and I bet it taste good but I didn't have time to grab a meal so a donut or a few, had to suffice.","I love this place! The best classic and old school style diner in my neighborhood. Friendly and kind staff and cozy atmosphere. I felt as if I were in the old film when I took my seat...amazing! Surprisingly they are open for 24 hours a day, so you can grab breakfast even at midnight!","I was hit hard with the donut sweats, so I hopped off the 7 train and paid Alpha Donuts another visit.I tried two new ones:French Cruller 4.0/5.0: This classic donut was nice with a crispy outer layer and mild sweetness. I also enjoyed how airy and light it was.Toasted Coconut 4.0/5.0: Another tasty offering! The coconut shreds were darkly toasted which amplified their flavor and the donut itself had a nice airy texture and (like the cruller) a restrained level of sweetness.These two donuts are most worthy of trying out!",Alpha Donuts
608,"been so many times!  steaks popped up everything, tasty, juicy, soft one thing to eat)) my family and I like this steak restaurant","We arrived almost at 2pm, the restaurant was almost empty, but they made us (and everyone that arrived) Wait 15 minutes to sit us down. When I got my soda, the glass was dirty and I could see the grease on top of the drink, I asked for it to be replaced and it wasn't that much better. When I ordered my sirloin, I asked for it to be medium well - but that's not what I got. I love Longhorn usually but this location, is definitely not up to the standards I'm used to from them.","This is so far the worst steakhouse we've ever been to!!! We waited about 1.5 hrs to get served with burned steak, burned shrimp,extra salty chicken etc. When we made a complaint with the server, she left for 5 mins, come back, took the food, left for another 5 mins and told us that they would cook a replacement for us. And so, we're still waiting, never knew that we are going to wait 2hrs to eat after we got seated!!","I enjoyed my time at this out back steak house .they serve more than steak over there they have a  variety of different dishes. Fish chicken burgers you name it.but I really enjoyed the chicken cutlet, the grilled chicken cutlet with the garlic sauce with the cheese on it and seasoned French fries with some steamed broccoli and some asparagus along with a ice cold seltzer water.they prepare a pretty good meal over there .the staff was nice and courteous and the prices weren't to bad for a pretty good meal .and the atmosphere was really relaxed over there. They also have a nice bar over there for all who want to get there drink on .plus the establishment was nice and clean. So I would definitely go back there in the future .",This place has really good food I went two times and it was the same the food was great I got a t bone steak delicious fresh and yummy the atmosphere was very good and the drinks were very good.I always pas by and never eaten there.Always good to try one you may be surprised.,"Okay so Stanley deserves 5 stars. He actually was great. The food was mediocre. If you been to Outback Steakhouse then this place is just a replica of that establishment. So I got the ribeye , loaded potato and garden salad. Salad didn't taste fresh, the loaded potato was great. Reason for 3 stars was my steak. I asked for medium well, welp I received a raw steak. Stanley took it back and apologized, another server brought the steak out and this time it's still raw. So I just ask for the check. Stanley did take my order off the bill which I appreciated so I made sure to tip him well. I was hoping this experience would of been better. Would I try it again.... maybe.",LongHorn Steakhouse
609,"The last time I was here with a friend, I had noticeable hairs on my plate of lasagna. Gross. The ice cream is the only thing worthwhile eating here. I won't be back.","Don't waste your time. The only thing this place has going for it is it's name to trap those who feel nostalgic for it. The food is mediocre at best, and good luck making even a minor substitution - apparently veggies instead of potatoes is too much of an ask. The place is known for its ice cream, but even that is a chore to order. The wait staff has no idea what any menu item is, and we were told that we couldn't order a two scoop sundae because ""we don't have cups that fit"". The decor is dingy, the staff is apathetic and the experience isn't worth it. Save your nostalgia for your memories, because sometimes you can't go home again.","They only serves packaged creamer and milk. Freaking diner serving ONLY packaged milk. When we ask for regular milk, the server just throws a bunch of more packaged milk on our table and is extremely rude. How do you not serve regular milk at a diner? Talk about cutting corners.","Jahn's takes you back. Waaaaaay back.You get nostalgia, deliciousness, excellent service and comfort all rolled into one. And I am so happy that I live just two blocks away. I would come here every day if my stomach allowed it. Weekend mornings will be busy. You'll wait in line for a bit and then be directed to your booth. While walking past the counter and front dining areas, you'll ask yourself ""Has Martin Scorcese filmed here?"" And ""what kind of deals went down in the back booths?"" In the 70s.My staple meal is the Big Breakfast - pancakes, eggs, hash browns, bacon and sausage. The menu photo shows Tomatoes and Mushrooms however, don't be fooled - those are just stock photos. Omelettes are well done too. What can I say? It's a diner. And it has an unmatched style.","Saturday morning, one of the few places in the area that could accommodate a table of four last minute. Comfortably decorated interior that's reminiscent of an old-school diner. Got seated in the back and was eventually greeted by a waitress.Fairly typical menu filled with everything you'd expect from a diner, as well as an eclectic dessert section. Settled on the German Omelette w/ Pancakes ($11.25) and a regular drip coffee ($1). Omelette is stuffed with a large helping of peppers, onions, bacon pieces, and potatoes - very filling and a good blend of ingredients. The short stack of three pancakes tasted fresh as they are super fluffy and served with some butter. Simple meal that was the perfect amount of food for breakfast.While our waitress was certainly friendly, it took a while for her to come around (busy day) and forgot one of the drink orders (not on the bill thankfully). Good place for the first meal of the day if they're not too slammed.",A 3.5 star review. Its basic diner food but it is a throw back to the old days of Jahn's when there was a chain of them around the city and you came for the ice cream. The breakfast are good but definitely have some ice cream if you want to feel the nostalgic.,Jahn's
610,"I've been to so many Mexican restaurants it's really difficult to keep track, however Mole has some unique features that sets it apart from the rest. Its cozy and small. It doesn't take itself too serious and offers authentic delicious Mexican food. I'm disappointed that there is no alchohol... that's a big No No for me. When you go out to eat an immerse yourself in a particular environment a great selection of alcohol makes a world of difference. That's the only reason it lost a star, other than that it's an above average Mexican restaurant at a great price.",Food here is fresh and yummy! Many vegetarian and fish options. Only gripe is they don't give you enough options. They have a simple but decent dessert menu.,We ordered delivery for dinner tonight and there was a large chicken bone mixed in with the rice in our enchilada order. Luckily nobody choked on it but we easily could have. I tried to email De Mole but their email requires image verification but there's no image so I couldn't submit an email so I therefore had to contact Grubhub (who we ordered through). They contacted de mole who ultimately refunded us HALF of the enchilada portion of our order. I guess the remaining $7 didn't outweigh a public review of what happened. We were frequent customers until tonight.,"Is delicious.I love the chicken quesadilla, tacos are good too. Guacamole is delicious. Great for deliveries. Is a great Mexican restaurant with affordable platesI will eat here more often if they were closer. Totally worth it","Had a great late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The inside is large and bright and clean.  We walked right in and got a table for 3. Things I love about the menu - vegetarian options, vegan options, brown rice option and wheat tortilla options.  And reasonably priced. Plus there is bison burger on the menu - must try that another time!We shared guacamole and chips - very delicious, and a good portion. For our meal we each ordered tacos. Shrimp tacos are not on the menu but we requested it. I ordered 3 tacos but 2 probably would've been fine since I had chips and guacamole already. The shrimp was nicely grilled and the barbacoa was really delicious.  The hot sauces are SO GOOD. The red one is hot and the green is mild. Be sure to ask for them!The hibiscus water is like a hibiscus iced tea and was perfect on a hot day.  my friend had the papaya milkshake and said it was AMAZING","Decent Mexican food at very reasonable prices especially for Astoria. The wait staff here are all great, very friendly. They no longer have a liquor license so no BYOB. The menu has the usual Mexican staples like tacos, burritos, etc. But they also have unusual items like squash blossom quesadilla which was very good. Another good dish is the taco salad. Very flavorful, albeit kinda small. The chicken taquito is another good dish. It's a good appetizer for sharing. Not too oily and it comes in six pieces. They have these sauces on the table, a green and red sauce that you can put on your food for more flavor. Surprisingly, the green sauce is terrible. No taste and very watery. Thankfully the red sauce is good. Had a nice kick to it. We doused our food with the red sauce. Overall, we found the food to be fresh, simple and honest with good vegetarian options. We'll be back.",De Mole Astoria
611,"The chicken is not even cook fully, and the owner is so annoying and keep trying to upsell you. Please don't come to this place.","The server was very friendly and understanding. Ordered the crispy chicken, but the middle of the chicken was colder than the outside. Like it was frozen a d fried. I said something about and the manager (i think) was somewhat argumentative. So I didn't bother about it. Maybe next time don't order the crispy chicken. Another thing I noticed was the fish tanks. The fish in it were all dead or dying. They haven't moved since I was at the restaurant. That was somewhat strange and not a good sign.","Totally random for my family to come here but we gave it a try for a birthday dinner. We had a table in the back and the whole restaurant probably had 2 other tables only - not very crowded.Food was standard - we got fatty pork, the typical garlic chicken, noodles... and I'd say decently on par with Chinatown. Service was decent.Nothing stand out but nothing faulty. Small parking lot in the back but there's the hotel lot next door you can use.","Choice of authentic Chinese or American Chinese, both menus are excellent.I had the Chow Fun with brown sauce. The noodles were outstanding.Also try the Kung Pao Chicken and General Tsao Chicken.Very friendly staff.","Major difference between last year and tonight's experience.Everything about tonight's experience was terrible.  The food is no longer good, the portions were ridiculous, the service was terrible and the up selling was incredibly off putting.How terrible?  Let's count the ways, A table of 12 and there was just one small tea pot.  That's just unacceptable.  $45 for 10 lamb chops is absurdly expensive even at the best non Chinese restaurants.  The fried flounder wasn't filleted properly at the table like it is done at every other Chinese restaurant.  When clearing the table, even when we said we had leftovers to take home, the waitress tried to clear the table.  The waitress even tried to clear a plate with food on it!  The last entree came 35 minutes after the first, clearly it was forgotten yet when asked about it after 30 minutes had gone by, they said it was in process and there were take out orders when there wasn't anyone around!  The restaurant even on a Saturday night only had 4 tables of customers!  This entree was the last item on the receipt.  Clearly it was forgotten so why not just say that?The constant up selling when ordering was really off putting.  Not sure how many times we had to say no to the duck entree the waitress was pitching.  There really isn't a need for that.  We were the largest table on this night, most likely your largest check, ordering the greatest number of entrees, why alienate your best customer?  This place used to be a decent reason not to goto Flushing but it's no longer the case.  I got the memo late as there clearly was a reason why this place was 3/4 empty tonight.  Terrible business practices seem to have taken the place of good service as others have surely found out.  Never again!","Best Cantonese food outside of Flushing.  That's for sure!  They do some really great fried dishes here including any dishes that begin with 'Salt and Pepper,...'.  The Salt and Pepper Pork Chops are really great and meaty unlike other places that are really fatty cuts of pork.  This is one dish I always order when I visit.  The Salt and Pepper Squid is really great as well.  If I have enough in my group, the Pork Chops and Squid are two dishes I always order.  There is also a variation of the Pork Chop in a red sauce called Peking Pork Chop.  This is great as well, I just prefer the cleaner salt and pepper version more.  Lastly, if you like scallops they have a scallop Salt and Pepper version as well which I do recommend.Another dish I order often is the Fried Flounder with scallions.  This is a standard order for me topped with sweet soy and scallions.  It's a bit more expensive for the whole fish but I find the quality is better when I go for whole as opposed to the fillets.  This dish often times is all I would need for dinner with some steamed rice.The Roasted Chicken with Fried Garlic is awesome.  The exterior of the chicken is a bit crispy and definitely salty, I think this is also fried for a short period of time for it to be crunchy and topping with fried garlic.  Great version of a Cantonese favorite.They have a few notable speciality dishes, Lobster over rice, or sticky rice, or noodles.  These are not the best renditions I've had but if it means not having to head to Flushing, it's worth it.  The Braised Noodles with mushroom is also good but doesn't seem to include enough mushrooms and scallions for that matter.  I did enjoy the fact that it was lighter on the oil and I would go back for this dish in the future.On another occasion I tried a rice noodle dish called Ha Moon Rice Noodle with slices of ham, egg and assorted veggies.  It was void of flavor and was a bit of a disappointment.The Sautéed String Beans with Pork and Snow Pea Leaves Sautéed with Garlic are perfect.  The Sautéed String Beans were fresh and had a snap to them that was delicious.  The Snow Pea Leaves were equally good with a hint of garlic.They supposedly have parking in the back which I've never used, I've just paid for parking in the front.",Ichopsticks
612,So good,"I really expected more given the rating that this place has. It's really not good. The mac and cheese tastes like it came straight out of a box, and my pulled pork sandwich was okay but had some fat chunks in it. Definitely do not recommend.","I should begin by saying that Mabel's Smokehouse was a disappointment.  The waitress was more interested in cleaning underneath the tables than attending to customers...the whole restaurant setup was disturbing, so you go in you look at the menu after you decide what you're having from the menu you take a walk to the bar and place your order, second I think that for a bbq establishment there should be wet naps on the table for messy hands and mouth we had to walk to the back of the restaurant where they had a large farmhouse sink, I could just imagine in their busiest night the line at the bar to order your food and the line just to was your hand and wipe your mouth. The food was bland, the drink was good I had the San Antonio Sling...We didn't bother to order desert.",Far from touristic points but worth it.The attendance is pleasant.Ambience clean and different.The food is excellent.Not expensive.If I have a chance I will come back.,"Mable's Smokehouse has to be for people who don't like seasonings.A phrase that comes to mind is ""Williamsburg Mc-BBQ""I split the 3 meat sampler with my boyfriend and it was a let down.The macaroni and cheese was on Kraft straight out the box level.  The yams had marshmallows in in...like is this food for adults??  It was way too sweet and not even good tasting.  The collard greens were undercooked so they had a weird bite to them.The meat itself... everything came-out luke-warm.  For a smokehouse they seemed like they were afraid to use the smoker on the ribs.The brisket was okay and edible.  Not tough, not tender.The pulled pork was the best of the three.  But pulled pork is really easy to make, so I wasn't impressed.You pretty much have to serve yourself.  You go up to the bar to place your order, you get a number and the food arrives.  You have to grab your own drinks and your own water.  The staff doesn't ask you how you think the food is, but it's Williamsburg, so I'm sure they expect a tip for ""something"".","Pros: Very good location. Friendly customer service. Gorgeous cashier (he has impeccable style). I met one of the owners and she made me feel very welcome. The bartender made sure I had everything I needed and she was a beaut! Cons: the food coma ain't no joke. It will happen to you!Overall: I definitely recommend this place.

I should've known I would've had a celiac episode after I found ACTUAL FOIL in the second piece of pizza.I ordered from Basil Brick Oven and received a pizza with at least two pieces of metallic foil buried underneath the cheese, until I stopped searching through it because I was so appalled. There were also food items resembling chicken in a pizza that was only supposed to have cheese, which is deeply disturbing for vegetarians hoping to eat here. I used to enjoy this establishment because they had good gluten free pizza, but these disgusting additions to my pizza will deter me from ever ordering from here again. I wish I could give zero stars.",So many places to eat pizza in Astoria but places always take the customer for granted.,"Basil is our GO TO. Anytime we try and venture to try someplace new - we are disappointed or always compare it to Basil. I'm not sure where to begin .. the food and service is just authentic. The Spec pizza is amazing. The buratta and focaccia is always fresh. My usual order is the steak over arugula with fresh parmesan shavings. Above all is the tiramisu. Hands down. I've eaten my way through Italy and am married to an Italian - the tiramisu is amazing. Most recently we went to Carbone ( high end restaurant in NYC) - I never not eat a piece of tiramisu, if it's in front of me - had 2 bites and realized how inferior it was to Basil's.The service always goes above and beyond - topping off your wine and never ever making you feel rushed to leave...","Came into town to visit one of my bestie and she took me to this amazing and homey restaurant.

614,"Had a bagel at Rego Bagels on Monday morning. A decent bagel that while not perfect was a satisfying option.Quality: Went with my standard order of an Everything Bagel with Scallion Cream Cheese. Even toasted it was a thick, fluffy, and soft bagel. The proportions looked off, but it was actually perfect. It lacked the tougher skin I personally like and it could have used more flavoring, as it felt closer to a plain bagel than an everything one.Quantity: Average sized bagel with a fair amount of cream cheese.Value: $4.00 for an Everything Bagel and Scallion Cream Cheese.Ambiance: Rego Bagels is located in the Rego Park area of Queens. About a block off Queens Blvd., it is a decent sized shop. You order in the back and they have an assortment of tables up front. Behind the counter things were very busy, which seemed surprising on a quiet morning.Crowd: A few people having coffee and bagels, while reading the paper. I'd expect to see the same crowd here every day.Service: A little slow considering the small crowd.Parking: Some parking a block away.",Ordered from here and specifically asked for the bagels to be toasted. Of course neither of the bagels were toasted smh,So I usually order from this establishment all the time via walk in. Today I ordered on seamless. The store was under the name of Bagel Creations & More and not Rego Bagel. I placed my order for a BLT & 20 ounce juice. I got my order at a reasonable time. When I open up my order I had the correct sandwich but my drink was incorrect. I had ordered an Apple cucumber banana and strawberry drink. I was sent a Apple ginger lemon pineapple drink. I contacted the store to see if they could take back the drink they sent and send me a new drink. They went back and forth with me on the phone saying I'm not in their order system so I needed to fix my address so I can get my replacement. I was very upset and confused to why I needed to change my address when I just received the incorrect order. Which means you have my address and you received my payment to send my order to this address. I contacted seamless and I was refunded though them. Now I'm stuck drinking this juice that has way too much lemon in it smh. Thanks Rego Bagel Aka Bagel Creations & More.,"Delicious bagels and great bagel sandwiches. Their default egg sandwiches have two eggs, which you need since the bagels are so thick.  The bagels are chewy without being too chewy, and perfectly cooked.","Elmhurst does not appear to have any actual bagel shops, so I decided to take a walk to Rego Bagel to satisfy my bagel craving just this past weekend. I don't think I've ever noticed this place before, but it looks like it's been around since at least the 80s or so. I had actually placed my order via Seamless earlier, so I didn't have to wait on line to order (and it did look a bit busy on the Sunday morning I had gone in).The bagel I got was pretty good: chewy and fairly dense. Coffee was pretty good as well. I had also ordered a B&W cookie, but was disappointed to see that it wasn't made in house (and was kind of expensive, as it was just a standard B&W cookie that you could easily get at your corner bodege for $1.25 or so). Even still, I'd come back here to try out different bagel and flavored cream cheese combinations again.","Rego Bagels is the best. They have so many different types of cream cheese (scallion, bacon scallion, veggie, on and on), bagels (everything, onion, the usuals) and bagel types (regular, little tiny mini, weird skinny ones)..

Shame on you.,"I gotta say I'm very disappointed after coming here since I was a child, I've learned from a very reliable source that almost all of the pastries there aren't even made there, they're delivered from other bakeries.they just make a handful of cakes. The canolie cream comes from a package. Yet they have the audacity to charge these very expensive prices. Last time I was there I bought a couple of chocolate Graham cookies and a strudel(that tasted stale) and it almost ran me close to  20 bucks. If I ever pay that much again I'll make sure they're made fresh and on premises.","Rude, terrible customer service. My mom placed an order here from out of state, to get delivered to me in Astoria which is a ways away from this store. She paid for a red velvet cake thru Caviar, but I never got the order. When I called them to ask what was up, the manager wouldn't even come to the phone- he just kept barking stuff to his employee to tell me. Basically saying that they never got any order, even though she paid, and he didn't even have the courtesy to come to the phone to rip us off! DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE.","This has been the place I've come to for years now, and the employees are always extremely welcoming and they always remember my order, so that's always fun. they make really good bagels and I love their coffee. If you're looking for really nice coffee in the ridgewood area, go here! will be definitely coming here soon, actually probably later today","Rudy's is on the way to my gym...so naturally I'm in here on the regular. They have so many delicious treats in here. My favorites include the tiramisu cup, the fruit danishes, and the walnut ring. I also love their milk chocolate covered pretzels. The pretzels are the perfect balance of sweet and salty. They sell them by the pound, but they also let me just purchase one or two when I want a small treat. They also have gelato, breakfast sandwiches, and coffee.I also recently went to Rudy's because I needed a custom cake for my mom's 60th birthday. I wanted something special and their staff helped me come up with a lovely concept. The cake had frosting roses, gold trim, and pudding inside. It looked pretty and it was also so delicious. My mom loved it. The staff here is so friendly and funny. I loved supporting this great bakery in my neighborhood.","HORRIBLE PLACE - DO NOT GO!Ok, I'm lying...it's probably THE BEST place in Ridgewood. I just selfishly do NOT want too many people to know about this incredible place! Most places in Ridgewood, get bombarded with hipsters, YUK! Amazing deserts, great sandwiches, great drinks! AND my Bf and I LOVE LOVE LOVE IDINA! (the rest of the staff is great too!)",Rudy's Pastry Shop
616,Very disappointed in their soy sauce chicken and roast pork over rice. The meats didn't seem fresh and there was barely any edible chicken (all skin and fat). The rice was also abit wet..Their golden fried rice with egg whites was good though; abit pricey during dinner time,"They have been here a couple of years, but I finally stopped in yesterday after seeing they have my favorite: I call it The Triple Threat: Roast Pork, Roast Chicken and Roast Duck.Not as cheap or as plentiful as my favorite spot in Chinatown: Wah Fung No 1 Fast Food yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no… but just as flavorful without the trip to Manhattan.",Pad Thai lacks lots of flavor and it's dry. 3 stars for the portion only. It's definitely not the authentic pad Thai dish I was expecting to eat.,"They get four stars from me because of their massive portions, trust me everything you order here is family sized. They lose a star because although I've been back a few times their credit card machine always seems to be out of order despite me calling and asking them if it was working. But alas the amazing food makes up for it. It might not be the most authentic but their food is delicious, no one can deny that. Ordering from Woke is great either as carry out or dine in (though you will see fine in options give bigger portions). I tend to order a lot of chicken lo-mein and i adore this place. Can't wait to go back. The staff is extra friendly they greet you as you walk in and as you leave. They provide complementary pots of tea on each table and are extremely fast in their service. The duck soup actually tastes fantastic the duck is so tender and juicy. I even writing about it I'm craving it, guess I'm going back tonight.","Don't let the 3 stars fool you. This place is delicious! If you need proof, check out my photos.. mmm. I admit, this was my first time coming here so I can't speak on consistency just yet but I'm already a fan and plan to return. It's located across the street from 7-11 and right next to the Dunkin' Donuts next door. I ordered the beef pan-fried noodles. The portions are massive and yes.. I ate it all! You can always order family style and share amongst the table (my personal favorite way of eating) but to each their own. In the words of my favorite bodybuilder, actor, and former politician.. I'll be back.","Inexpensive Chinese food. When the kitchen is on, the food is very good. The unevenness of the quality prevents me from giving a higher score. The egg tarts are good, as is their sautéed vegetables, walnut shrimp with mayo. Not much atmosphere in restaurant.",Wo Kee Noodle
617,This place was ... pretty bad!My whole family came here for lunch and half of us got sick. We had the lunch buffet. The service was slow. The food was okay. But the feeling it left me with afterwards was not.I wouldn't recommend this place.,"The place is packed because of its all you can eat food. It is okay food, cleanliness not so much. If we need some indian food fix I will be back!","Mediocre food at low prices. Indifferent service at best. The large room is often understandably empty, and it's sometimes easier to bus your own table than to induce a waiter to do so. Simply move dirty dishes onto one of the many empty tables that surround you in this vast depressing room. If you run out of naan, ask for it if a waiter walks by. Otherwise it will not be replaced.  The atmosphere is funereal. The welcome one expects on arrival is ironically reserved for departure. I think the kitchen does the best one can expect for the price, but there's a sad, pointless inadequacy on the part of management.",Numerous changes have lead me to believe they're doing better than ever.* They run the buffet 7 days a week and till 4:30pm. That's probably their bread and butter but not many Indian places can afford to do so.* Overhaul of the staff. Phone manners are better. Just nicer people in general and they're actually protective of the buffet. Patrons aren't just coming up with their dirty plates without being met by someone.* Naan is no longer being served on the buffet. Instead it's being served fresh table side. * Pitchers of water are chilled and filled with ice. Goodbye room temperature stale water.,"Jackson Diner still holds the distinction of having the funkiest decor of all of the Indian AYCE buffets in Jackson Heights and is easily the biggest tourist trap for all of the non-locals who aren't willing to venture too far from 74th Street.  That said, Jackson Diner could be used as a benchmark for the inhibited, non-savy, yet curious Indian foodies only now they have to cough up $10.95 for the lunch buffet.  The secret for Jackson Diner is their ability to place the food in front of the large window for all hungry pedestrians looking from the outside.  Delhi Palace, Indian Taj, and Ashoka (before they closed) all had their food covered or placed in the back.  Of all of the other popular restaurants, Jackson Diner still doesn't take credit card while nearby Taj and Delhi Palace will gladly take it for a minimum of $10 or more.  Not to hate on them too much, the food is relatively decent and the selection is good.  Waiting for Dosas can really jam the line up and the crowds are still too fierce on the weekends.  Chicken Mehkni and Sag Paneer are rich and full of flavor, while the Aloo Tikki, Khadi Pakoras, and Chana Aloo still leave for much to be desired.And of course, the service still and may always suck.","For the non-savy, this place would sound like a regular diner, perhaps stereotypically owned by a Greek person given that its in Queens.  But instead, its one of the most popular Indian spots, right smack dab in the heart of Little India of Jackson Heights.  With some seriously funky decor, it is reminscent of a cafeteria turned Indian establishment.  For about $10, the weekend buffet is a treat as the butter chicken, palak paneer, and goat curries are sensational, while the tandoori, samosas, and chana aloo are a bit dry.  So far as I've sampled, the desserts (mostly rice pudding) have been lacking variety if not taste.   I have ordered rasmali on several occasions to find that it is excellent (but for $5 bucks?).Service has gone downhill here, especially since the place has become so popular during weekend afternoons and nights.  I have considered their delivery on several occasions, but their area has recently been reduced to only a few blocks outside of the Jackson Heights area.  Beware, this place is cash only.",Jackson Diner
618,"Update: I dined in and was amazed at how polite everyone is there. My typical experience dining in at a pizza place is that the guys working behind the counter aren't that friendly, may talk down to me because I'm a woman by myself, may hit on me, etc. These guys were 100% wholesome polite folks who delivered nothing but the best service. I have never seen such good customer service in a little pizza shop! The food of course was great, too. I have not tried their slices, but their entrees and appetizers are very tasty.",Love this place.  I have been going to Alfies since I was a kid.  I don't live in the neighborhood anymore but I still try to make it there once a month with my kids.,I had heard of this place so I wanted to try it. Though known for the Sicilian pizzas I bought a large regular pie. My only complaint was I did not find the pizzas had enough sauce. The cheese was fine as was the crust. There is seating inside. I will post an updated review as I will try their Sicilian slice next time. The prices here are reasonable. A decent pizzeria overall.,Delicious and freshly made pizza in the neighborhood Delivery service available Affordable prices Great phone etiquette Daily specials are awesome Delivery never takes longer than 40 minutes Open daily Wings & garlic knots are delightful Close to home Reliable service Want to try the other dishes they have but always go back to the pizza. :)Definitely recommend this pizzeria.,"Can I say I love this a Sicilian slice.  I use to live in cliffside park, New Jersey and each time the kids wanted a slice I would drive all the way there for a whole pie. Now I live in Texas and I drove here for vacation and the first thing they asked for was a slice. I love the way you have the perfect blend of everything at the first bite. It's crispy, fluffy, cheesy and with a perfect place of herbs and spices. Plus everybody is super nice in the pizzeria and best of all there are cheap. Plus it is worth the drive from what ever part of the word you are from. Try it, you will love it. EatNow thank me later.",Great Caesar slice I had that can't be replicated fresh salad in crunchy pizza I could fold the slice too without all its content falling out very impressive Sicilians are also very good and every time we are in queens we make sure to get a slice Old fashioned pizza joint in wife's old neighborhood great spot all should check out,Alfie's Pizza
